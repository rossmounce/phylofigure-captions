"FIGURE 8. Pattern of the geographic variation for polymorphic qualitative character along of the Atractus torquatus complex.The number of supralabials = 1, number of infralabials = 2 and number of maxillary teeth = 3. The colour represents the frequency for each state of characters: blue correspond to six; green correspond to seven and red correspond to eight. The frequencies of the character states are from our own sample plus from the Dixon & Soini (1986). The total sample comprises 81individuals and the traits were counted in both sides for each specimen."
