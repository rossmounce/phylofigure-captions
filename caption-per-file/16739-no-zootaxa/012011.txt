"FIGURE 2. Miocene chronostratigraphy, magnetostratigraphy and biostratigraphy (PF: Planktonic Foraminifera, CN: Calcareous Nannoplankton) after Hilgen et al. (2009) with regional Paratethys stages after Piller et al. (2007). The figure is modifiedfrom a chart produced with the Time Scale Creator program, provided by the International Commission on Stratigraphy (available at: http://stratigraphy.org/column). The number of cancellariid species per stage is indicated in the grey bars."
