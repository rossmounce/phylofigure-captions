"FIGURE 2. Haplotype network based on variation in POMC sequences in seven Paramesotriton species. H1â€“H8 denote majorhaplotypes, the size of circles is proportional to the number of individuals (all were homozygotes) bearing a certain haplotype(H8: 1 individual; H3 and H6: 2 individuals; H1, H4 and H7: 3 individual; H2 and H5: 4 individuals)."
