"FIGURE 4. Advertisement call of Leptolalax dringi (paratype BMNH 1978.4) recorded at unknown temperature. (A) 45 soscillogram of relative amplitude over time for 41 calls. (B) spectrogram and (C) corresponding oscillogram of two successivecalls each containing 11 and nine notes, expanded from the section pointed by arrow in A. (D) spectrogram and (E) corresponding oscillogram of the first three notes in B, each containing one, one, and two pulses, respectively. (F) power spectrum (relative amplitude vs. frequency) of first note shown in Dâ€“E."
