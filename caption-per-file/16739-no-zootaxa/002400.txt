"FIGURE 8. Median joining network of cytochrome b haplotypes from O. moojeni (white circles) and O. utiaritensis (gray circles). Haplotype circles are proportional to their frequency. Dashes indicate mutations among haplotypes and dark circles indicate estimated haplotypes that were not sampled. The arrow shows the position of root, based on ML analysis (see Fig. 6).Discussion"
