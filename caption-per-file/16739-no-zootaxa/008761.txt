"FIGURE 7. Statistical parsimony nuclear allele networks of c-mos, mc1r and rag2 loci with colors corresponding to species H.yerburii, H. festivus sp. nov. and H. alkiyumii sp. nov.. Circle sizes are proportional to the number of alleles. White circles representmutational steps. C1, C2 and C3 refer to the different genetic lineages found within H. alkiyumii (see Fig. 5 and Appendix III)."
