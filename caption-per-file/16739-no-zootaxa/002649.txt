"FIGURE 4. Principle Component Analysis plot (PCA) of all qualified character variables for the haptoral armature of all Callorhynchocotyle species excluding C. hydrolagi. Separations by component 1 are acted upon by decreasing sizes of the hamulusmeasurements and increasing sizes of sucker sclerites of all 3 sucker complexes. The function of the latter is likely to be influenced by the difference in sclerite symmetry of species parasitising representatives of Callorhynchidae and Chimaeridae. Separations by component 2 are acted upon significantly by sucker sclerites shape as a function of the relationship between lengthand diameter."
