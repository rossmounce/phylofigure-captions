"FIGURE 3. A single representative call of: (A) C. australis sp. nov., Tully Falls, 750 m a.s.l., 18°C; (B) C. hinchinbrookensissp. nov., Mt Diamantina, Hinchinbrook Island, 770 m a.s.l., 19°C; (C) Cophixalus ornatus, Butchers Ck, 715 m a.s.l., 18.5°C.These calls were selected because they are from similar altitudes and temperatures, and because they fall near the group centroid of variation within each species from analyses in Hoskin et al. (2011). Waveforms display amplitude (y-axis) against time"
