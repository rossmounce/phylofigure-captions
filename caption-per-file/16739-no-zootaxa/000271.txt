"FIGURE 3. Relationships between male to female ratio in major cheliped height and carapace length of shrimp. Regressionswere calculated excluding types and specimens from Ghardaqa and Kiribati.TABLE 1. Dissimilarity between groups (above diagonal), within-group similarity (diagonal, bold), and ANOSIM probabilities (below diagonal). Below dissimilarities are the characters that contribute to at least 50% (cut-off was 50%) of the dissimilarity as calculated by SIMPER and their percentage contribution (underlined)."
