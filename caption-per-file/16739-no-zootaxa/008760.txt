"FIGURE 6. Statistical parsimony nuclear allele networks of c-mos, mc1r and rag2 loci with colors corresponding to species H.persicus, H. luqueorum sp. nov. and H. hajarensis sp. nov.. Circle sizes are proportional to the number of alleles. White circlesrepresent mutational steps. B1 and B2 refer to the different genetic lineages found within H. hajarensis (see Fig. 5 and Appendix III)."
