"FIGURE 22. Types of loculate microducts found in Afrotropical Ceroplastinae. Note that: (i) the innermost (primary) loculus is quitewide on rusci-type and intermediate-type microducts, but narrow in the complex-type; (ii) the left-hand most microduct in the ruscitype column is unique to the C. rusci- and C. theobromae-groups; and that (iii) microducts with 3 satellite loculi, although present on afew species in these latter two species-groups, are extremely scarce and are often absent on most specimens, even in the wax-plate lines."
