Panbiogeographic map elaborated from both the current distribution of Acanthotetilla spp. and its phylogeneticcladogram (Fig. 5) by the hand method listed in Henderson (1989), subsequently adapted by Hajdu (1995) and in the presentstudy. Arrowheads represent the polarity of each track. Multiple arrowheads in a single track imply several polarities inferred"
