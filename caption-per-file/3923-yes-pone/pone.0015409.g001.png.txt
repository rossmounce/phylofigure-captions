Phylogenetic relationships of the woody plant taxa in the Luquillo Forest Dynamics Plot (LFDP), Puerto Rico. A maximum parsimony consensus tree using an APG III-based ordinal constraint tree combined with a supermatrix of sequence data from the three-locus DNA barcode (rbcLa+trnH-psbA+matK) of the 142 species of woody plants recorded in the LFDP. Taxonomic orders are colored-coded and correspond to orders indicated in inset figure. Nodes with weak support ("
