"pone.0065990.g001.png","Evolutionary history ofVerticillium longisporum illustrated by a cartoon phylogenetic tree based on Inderbitzin et al [47].Verticillium longisporum evolved at least three different times by hybridization of Species A1with Species D1, V. dahliae lineage D2 and V. dahliae lineage D3, resulting in V. longisporum lineages A1/D1, A1/D2 and A1/D3, respectively. Verticillium dahliae isolates are in blue, Species D1 in green, Species A1 in orange and V. alfalfae in gray. Red arrows indicate parents of V. longisporum, connecting lines represent the three V. longisporum lineages. The Verticillium dahliae lineage D2 is marked as ‘V. dahliae D2’ and comprises both V. dahliae isolates and D2-alleles of V. longisporum lineage A1/D2. The Verticillium dahliae lineage D3 (‘V. dahliae D3’) comprises only D3-alleles of V. longisporum lineage A1/D3. Most of the V. dahliae isolates in Inderbitzin et al. [47] belonged to the clade marked ‘V. dahliae main group’. Tree is not to scale."
