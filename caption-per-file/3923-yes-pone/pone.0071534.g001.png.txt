Correlations between cross-binding activities of antibodies and phylogenetic grouping of HA.(A) Phylogenetic relationships among 16 HA subtypes of influenza A viruses based on amino acid sequences. The HA amino acid sequences of the viruses used for ELISA antigens were used. (B) The subtypes of HAs to which serum IgG antibodies of subcutaneously immunized mice showed cross-binding activity (See also Figure 2). In each phylogenetic tree, the HA subtype used for immunization is circled. The HA subtypes to which antibodies showed cross-binding activity are shown in black (O.D. ? 1.0) or dark gray (1.0 > O.D. ?0.5) background."
