"pone.0045255.g006.png","Unrooted phylogenetic tree of LOG and homologs in tomato (red dots), Arabidopsis (AtLOGs), rice (LOG and LOGLs) and moss (XP).For Arabidopsis, rice and moss, sequences used were those described in Kuroha et al. (2009) [24]. For tomato, sequences were obtained from the SOL genomic resource after BLAST with AtLOG1. The phylogenetic tree was constructed in MEGA5.05 program (hppt://www.megasoftware.net) using the neighbor-joining method with 1000 bootstrapping replicates. The bootstrap values above 60% are indicated on the tree. The scale represents 0.05 amino acid substitutions per site."
