Maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree constructed from 56 HIV-1 C pol sequences from Senegal and 121 close relatives. Detailed maximum likelihood (PhyML) phylogenetic tree constructed using 1,011 nucleotide sites of pol gene sequence (nucleotides 2,253â€“3,263 of HXB2 coordinates) from 177 HIV-1 subtype C isolates from Senegal and close relatives (see text). Branch support values (bootstrap and aLRT) are displayed (see figure legend). Colors indicate the geographic origin and sequences were isolated in the following countries: 56 in red from Senegal, 25 in orange from Zambia, 49 in yellow from southern Africa (Botswana 6; Mozambique 5; Swaziland 2; South Africa 35; Zimbabwe 1), 12 in green from East Africa (Burundi 2; Ethiopia 9; Kenya 1; Sudan 2), 3 in blue from other African countries (DRC 1; Equatorial Guinea 1; Gabon 1) and 30 in black from European and Asian countries (Belgium 4; China 1; Germany 2; Denmark 1; Spain 5; France 1; Greece 1; Israel 1; India 1; Italia 1; Luxembourg 1; Norway 2; Portugal 2; Sweden 7)."
