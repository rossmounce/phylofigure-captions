Numbers of non-synonymous (n) and synonymous (s) substitutions in four groups.A phylogenetic tree was constructed using 24 PIN1 protein-coding sequences. Shown above each branch is the n/s value. The n/s values for the groups formed by Poaceae, Brassicaceae, Fabaceae, and the mixed group including AmtPIN1 (and excluding their ancestral branches) are shown below their names. The three solid, red nodes represent the positions of the ancestors of the four groups. N and S are the calculated number of non-synonymous and synonymous sites, respectively. Blue arrows (Aâ€“E) indicate branches that have undergone positive selection."
