"pone.0078715.g001.png","The stoichiometric subunit composition of eIF3 varies across species.Cladogram constructed using sequences of 18S rRNA from the listed organisms. The subunit composition of eIF3 from each organism is depicted using spherical models. Subunit count in the stoichiometric complex of the displayed organisms is as follows: H. sapiens, D. rerio, M. musculus, C. elegans, D. melanogaster, N. crassa, D. discoideum and A. niger (12); A. thaliana (11); S. pombe (Csn7b, left, or Int6, right, complexes) (8 each); T. brucei (8); S. cerevisiae (5), The size of the spheres used to depict eIF3 subunits are relative to their respective molecular weights. The tree was constructed using tools at www.phylogeny.fr[46]."
