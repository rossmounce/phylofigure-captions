Class 3 inteins are monophyletic. A phylogenetic tree of Class 3 inteins based on conserved intein motifs was generated using MrBayes [15] in the Geneious software package. The scale bar represents 0.3 substitutions per site. A larger phylogenetic analysis previously excluded all non-Class 3 inteins examined from this clade [11]. Except for the Arsp-FB-24 Arth_1007 intein, intein names are defined in the InBase database (http://www.neb.com/neb/inteins.html) [6] with the additional T3 suffix, which indicates that these are Class 3 inteins."
