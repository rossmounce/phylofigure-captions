Phylogenetic analysis of Agouti-like sequences.The unrooted maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree of Agouti-like sequences. Robustness of the nodes is tested with the posterior probabilities based on MCMC analysis as implemented in the MrBayes program. Both bootstrap (out of 500 replicates) and the posterior probability support were given in italics for the significant nodes. The posterior probability (1) of the A2 node is highlighted in red color. The tree is rooted on the node that clustered the consensus sequences, which serves as out-group.The tree shows that A2 is likely to have branched from ASIP1."
