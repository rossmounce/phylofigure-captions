"pone.0055726.g003.png","NeighborNet analysis.SplitsTree v4 NeigborNet analysis of 77 V. parahaemolyticus isolates based on 7 concatenated housekeeping loci (dnaE, gyrB, recA, dtdS, pntA, pryC and tnaA) representing a total 3,682 nucleotides. Sequence typing (ST) designations for MLST analysis and phylogenetic clades (1?12) included for reference. Regions of the network showing extensive reticulation (e.g., clades 8 and 10), consistent with higher rates of recombination, contrast with the less reticulated nature of clade 12. Highlights in blue distinguish groups of isolates sharing ST and clade designations and function to facilitate comparison with Figure 2."
