"pone.0016124.g011.png","Phylogenetic analysis of mosquito and Drosophila DHPAA synthases with other insect AAAD sequences. The overall sequence identity among the compared sequences ranged from 32–100%. Sequence identity of individual groups: Ddc group, 74–100%; Putative Hdc group, 69–90%; putative Tdc-1 group, 63–87%; putative Tdc-2 group, 76–94%; DHPAA synthase group, 53–100%. The protein sequences were aligned with CLUSTAL W (ver. 2.0.10) and the alignment was manually checked. Then the phylogenetic and molecular evolutionary analyses were conducted using the neighbor-joining method with 1000 times bootstrap embedded in the CLC Main Workbench software (ver. 5.7.1). Abbreviations: Ae, Aedes aegypti; Cu, Culex quinquefasciatus; An, Anopheles gambiae, Dm, Drosophila melanogaster; Ddc, L-dopa decarboxylase; Tdc, L-tyrosine decarboxylase."
