Genealogical analysis of T. piceus and T. columbinus.Excised portions of phylogenetic trees based on beta tubulin (BT2), calmodulin (CF), minichromosome maintenance factor 7 (Mcm7) and RNA polymerase beta (RPB2). Bootstrap values above 90% are represented as bold lines. The BT2 tree divides T. piceus and T. columbinus isolates into four statistically supported clades while the other three loci place all T. piceus isolates on a single branch and all T. columbinus isolates on another branch. The BT2 primer set appears to be amplifying different gene fragments or the locus may have undergone rearrangements that make the analysis appear paralogous. Genealogical concordance is seen in a majority of the trees, which supports T. columbinus and T. piceus as distinct species."
