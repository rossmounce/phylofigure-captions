"pone.0008156.g001.png","The phylogenetic tree of human (black squares) and swine (white squares) hepatitis E virus (HEV) isolates in central China, 2007â€“2008.The phylogenetic tree was produced with a 150-nt ORF2 sequence alignments of 42 isolates in the present study and other 16 representative reference sequences. The scale bar indicates a genetic distance of 0.02% nucleotide substitution per position. Values for various branches are percentages of the tree obtained from 1000 resamplings of the data. Genotype 1, 2 and 3 strains are included as outgroup. The three black triangles show the three representative strains whose complete sequences of ORF2 were determined in the present study."
