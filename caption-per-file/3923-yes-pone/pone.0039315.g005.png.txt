Illustration of how flawed taxonomic schemes and sequence quality can result in incorrect classifications.The phylogenetic trees were created starting from the full-length reference sequences that were used to train RDPâ€™s taxonomic scheme version 5 for Pseudomonas and Azomonas (A), and Neisseriaceae (B), respectively. These sequences were clustered into 3% OTUs with mothur and representatives for each OTU were selected for building a tree with FastTree. The number of sequences belonging to each OTU is indicated in brackets.(C) Scatter density plots of percent low quality (QV"
