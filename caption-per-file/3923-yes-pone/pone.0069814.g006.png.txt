"pone.0069814.g006.png","Most likely reconstruction of geographic range evolution in the SRM model for sect. Trachyphyllum, inferred through Lagrange. Colors correspond to areas shown on the map in Fig. 1 (blue = North America Interior [NAI]; green = North America Coast [NAC]; yellow = Beringia [BER]; orange = Central Asia & Siberia [CAS]; red = Japan [JAP]). On the phylogeny, white bars represent interglacial periods and gray bars denote glacials. Dispersal matrices for interglacial periods are shown above for each model, with ‘>’ representing directional dispersal and ‘-’ meaning no dispersal. Dispersal was not permitted during glacial periods. The models are as follows: SRM - origin in North America Interior followed by westward dispersal across Beringia and into Asia; BER - dispersal out of Beringia onto both continents; CAS - origin in Central Asia with eastward dispersal across Beringia and into North America; JAP - origin in Japan with eastward dispersal across Beringia and into North America; REF - isolation in each refugium with no dispersal possible until 10 - 0 kya. Time is shown in thousands of years along the bottom of the figure."
