"pone.0089107.g002.png","Phylogeography of Megacopta stinkbugs.(A) A Bayesian phylogeny of East Asian native and North American introduced Megacopta populations inferred from 8,552 aligned nucleotide sites of mitochondrial DNA sequences. Posterior probability of the Bayesian analysis, bootstrap probability of the maximum-likelihood analysis, and bootstrap probability of neighbor-joining analysis are indicated on each node, wherein asterisks indicate the statistical values lower than 50%. Triangles, circles, and question marks beside the sample codes indicate morphological identification of the populations as M. cribraria, M. punctatissima, and intermediate, respectively [9], [10]. Clades A?H are indicated below the sample codes in different colors. (B) Geographical locations of Japanese native Megacopta populations examined in this study. Clades A?H and morphotypes are indicated as in Fig. 2A."
