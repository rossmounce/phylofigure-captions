Unrooted phylogenetic tree of the φX174 F-like major capsid proteins. The evolutionary history was inferred by using the Maximum Likelihood method based on the Whelan and Goldman model [58]. The bootstrap consensus tree was inferred from 1000 replicates. Branches corresponding to partitions reproduced in less than 50% bootstrap replicates are collapsed. The scale bar represents the number of substitutions per site. The analysis involved 35 amino acid sequences. All positions containing gaps and missing data were eliminated. There were a total of 356 positions in the final dataset. φX174-like virus group includes φX174 (GI:9626381), WA10 (GI:71843040), S13 (GI:11095662), NC11 (GI:71842956), ID1 (GI:71842872). α3-like virus group includes α3 (GI:9625363), φK (GI:2493329), st-1 (GI:242346750). G4-like virus group includes G4 (GI:9626346), WA6 (GI:71843160), ID12 (GI:71843172). CPAR39-like virus group includes. Chp2-like virus group includes Chp2 (GI:9634949), Chp3 (GI:47566141), Chp4 (GI:77020115), CPAR39 (GI:9791178), φCPG1 (GI:17402851). SARssφ1 (GI:313766927) and SARssφ2 (GI:313766923) are uncultured microviruses the genomes of which were assembled by Tucker et al [9]. GOS sequences are microvirus-like major capsid proteins obtained during the Sorcerer II Global Ocean Sampling (GOS) Expedition [44]: GOS_10590 (GI:142008996), GOS_10391 (GI:142009231), GOS_11182 (GI:142008205), GOS_11146 (GI:142008257), GOS_10803 (GI:142008696)."
