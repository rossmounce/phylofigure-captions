"pone.0004598.g002.png","Neighbor-joining tree of Crocus.The extremely short branches make identification by cluster memberships difficult as does the “non-monophyly” of several species. Species that cannot be identified by any of the sequences used are marked in blue. The NJ tree is rooted with the two Crocus species that are sister group to the remaining Crocus species in the parsimony based phylogeny (see figure S1)."
