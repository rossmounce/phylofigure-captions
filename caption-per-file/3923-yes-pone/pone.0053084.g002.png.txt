Phylogenies of the S-endosymbiont Wolbachia.A. Phylogenetic tree reconstruction based on wsp gene sequences (length = 480 bp) of Wolbachia of B. tabaci cryptic species using maximum-likelihood analysis under the T92 substitution model. The bootstrap values are indicated. Trichogramma deion (AF020084) and Drosophila melanogaster (AF020072) are used as outgroups. Accession numbers for wtab1-16 submitted to GenBank are JX428697–JX428712. All wsp sequences of Wolbachia used in this study were clustered with other blast references sequences from GenBank and their ML phylogenetic reconstruction is shown Fig. C. B. Phylogenetic tree reconstruction based on ftsZ gene sequences (length = 850) of Wolbachia of B. tabaci cryptic species using ML analysis under the TN93 substitution model. The bootstrap values are indicated. Drosophila simulans in case of ftsZ gene (AY227739) is used as the outgroup. Accession numbers for sequences used in the tree are JX428732–JX428742. All ftsZ sequences of Wolbachia used in this study were clustered with other blast references sequences from GenBank and their ML phylogenetic reconstruction is shown Fig. S1D."
