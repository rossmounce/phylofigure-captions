"pone.0016923.g002.png","Phylogenetic tree of CYP2C amino acid sequences. The phylogenetic tree was created by the neighbour-joining method using CYP2C amino acid sequences of human (h), cynomolgus monkey (mf), rhesus monkey (mm), dog (d), and rat (r), found in GenBank. For cynomolgus monkey CYP2C93, the amino acid sequence was predicted from the SV1 cDNA (c.102 was filled in with thymine). Human CYP2A6 amino acid sequence was used as outgroup."
