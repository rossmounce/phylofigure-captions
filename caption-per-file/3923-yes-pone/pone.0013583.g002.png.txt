"pone.0013583.g002.png","The phylogenetic analyses of viruses in the Parvoviridae family.The phylogenetic tree was constructed from nearly full-length nucleotide sequences of subfamilies Parvovirinae (genera Parvovirus, Erythrovirus, Dependovirus, Amdovirus, and Bocavirus) and Densovirinae, using the MEGA 4.1 software (neighbor-joining method with 1,000 bootstrap replicates). PBoV1 and PVoB2 are labeled with black diamonds. MVC: minute virus of canines; BPV: bovine parvovirus; HBoV: human bocavirus; Pbo-likeV: porcine boca-like virus."
