"pone.0035647.g004.png","Phylogenetic occurrence of the major V1 hypervariable motifs.The phylogenetic tree was built from 1803 full-length 16S rRNA sequences of Pseudomonas available in the databases, after excluding the V1 region (see Figure S7). Each colour corresponds to a V1 motif (present in the original 16S rRNA sequence) found in at least two r-clusters. For the sake of visibility, only the six major V1 motifs (see Table 4) are shown, from the most represented (red circle), in this descending order: red, green, yellow, dark blue, purple, and light blue circles."
