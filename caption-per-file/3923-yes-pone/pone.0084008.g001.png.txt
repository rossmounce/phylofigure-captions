"pone.0084008.g001.png","African-born Victorian residents with HIV: phylogenetic analysis of V3 env sequences and reference subtype A, B and C sequences.Neighbour joining tree reflecting the genetic relationship between HIV-1 isolates from African-born Victorians, the most homologous HIV-1 strains and selected reference strains. Study isolates are indicated in bold followed by Country of Birth/Country of reported exposure. Significant bootstrap values are indicated at the relevant node. Sequences were analysed over a 369bp region corresponding to the HIV-1 envelope region and spanning nucleotides 6984–7353 (HXB2 coordinates). The scale bar represents 2% genetic distance. Country codes: AUS – Australia; BOT- Botswana; CAN – Canada; CHI-China; CZE – Czech Republic; DJI – Djibouti; ERI – Eritrea; ETH – Ethiopia; EUR – Europe; FIN- Finland; FRA – France; GER – Germany; GHA – Ghana; GUI – Guinea Bissau; KEN – Kenya; MAL – Malawi; NET – The Netherlands; PNG – Papua New Guinea; SAF – South Africa; SWI – Switzerland; TAN – Tanzania; USA – United States of America; 23 – Uganda; 24 – Zambia; 25 – Zimbabwe."
