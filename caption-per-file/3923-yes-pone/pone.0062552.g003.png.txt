Maximum-likelihood phylogenetic trees form each non-recombinant fragment were constructed using all available sequences from proviral DNA (indicated by black circles) and plasma isolate (indicated by an empty circles) along with HIV-1 reference sequences from the Los Alamos HIV-1 database representing 11 genetic subtypes.The numbering for the HIV-1 fragment A, B1, B2 and C sequences corresponds to the HXB2 reference sequence. For purposes of clarity, the tree was midpoint rooted. The approximate likelihood ratio test (aLRT) values of ?70% are indicated at nodes. The scale bar represents 0.05 nucleotide substitutions per site."
