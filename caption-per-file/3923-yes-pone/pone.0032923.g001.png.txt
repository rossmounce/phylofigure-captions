"pone.0032923.g001.png","Simplified phylogenetic tree showing the evolutionary relationships among the major deuterostome taxa (with the common names of organisms in brackets) and their ancestors discussed in this paper. The hypothetical ancestral genome predicted by Nakatani et al. (“N”) probably belongs to an organism that existed just before 2R in early vertebrates. On the other hand, Putnam et al. (“P”) reconstructed the karyotype of the common ancestor of amphioxus and the olfactores (tunicates+vertebrates). 1R, 2R and 3R mark the three rounds of whole genome duplication that happened throughout vertebrate evolution. Tree topology adapted from Putnam et al [20]."
