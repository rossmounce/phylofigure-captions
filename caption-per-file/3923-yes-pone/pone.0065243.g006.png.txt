Phylogenetic tree based on MSP1a tandem repeat amino acid sequences.The MSP1a sequences from tick-transmissible and non-transmissible strains (Table 2) were included in the phylogenetic analysis. The phylogenetic tree was reconstructed using the neighbor joining and maximum likelihood methods. Reliability for internal branch was assessed using the bootstrapping method with 1000 bootstrap replicates. Bootstrap values are shown as % in the internal branch. The tree shows four phylogenetic clusters containing different patterns of MSP1a tandem repeat 2D structures. Cluster ?-?-c (blue), cluster ?-1 and cluster ?-2 (beige) contain tick-transmissible A. marginale strains while in cluster ? (red) fall the non-tick-transmissible strains."
