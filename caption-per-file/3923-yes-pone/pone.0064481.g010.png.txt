Neighbor-joining bootstrap tree of CYP450 proteins in plants.Amino acid sequences of 148 plant cytochrome P450s (CYPs), including 105 sequences representative of the 10 CYP families in land plant and 41 P450s from the B. vulgaris transcriptome (marked with dots), were used to construct the phylogenetic tree. Multiple alignments were performed with Clustal W, and the tree was generated with MEGA 5. The 10 CYP clades are labeled. Bootstrap values are shown at the nodes.
