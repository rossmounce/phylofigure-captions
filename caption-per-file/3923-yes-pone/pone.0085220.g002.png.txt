Phylogenetic analysis of CnPnV strain Bari/100-12 and other members of the genus Pneumovirus.Maximum parsimony trees are based on the 8,598-nt fragment spanning from the very 3? end of the L gene to the 5?end of the leader region (A), nucleocapsid (B) and fusion (C) proteins. For phylogenetic tree construction, the reference strains and GenBank accession numbers are as reported in Tables 2 and 3. The distantly-related Metapneumovirus human metapneumovirus (HMPV) CAN97-83 (NC_004148) was used as outgroup. A statistical support was provided by bootstrapping over 1,000 replicates. The scale bars indicate the estimated numbers of nucleotide or amino acid substitutions."
