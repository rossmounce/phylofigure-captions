Genetic diversity and sequence type (ST) distribution, determined by MLST [10], of 142 S. agalactiae isolates from cases of adult (AI) and neonatal (NI) invasive disease. We show the phylogenetic network applied to 43 parsimonious-informative sites from a total of 3,456 nucleotides generated with the neighbour-net algorithm for the 142 strains studied (http://splitstree.org/) [29]. Strains were grouped into clonal complexes (CCs) with eBURST software (http://eburst.mlst.net/). Columns indicate the percentages of AI and NI strains in each CC. Recombination (R) and mutation (M) rates, based on MLST data, were evaluated as described by Feil et al. [31]. The estimated recombination-mutation ratio (R/M) varied as a function of the CC to which the strain belonged."
