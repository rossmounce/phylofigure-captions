"pone.0017344.g007.png","The DAP kinases phylogenetic tree. A phylogenetic tree of the indicated organisms was constructed based on the multiple alignment of the DAP kinase scatalytic domain, using the PHYML program. Numbers above branches represent bootstrap support from 100 replicates. Yellow background- high bootstraps value. Blue- DAPk; Green- DRP-1; Red- ZIPk; Black- ortholog undetermined due to partial sequence."
