Schematic representation of HGT and molecular clock. The left tree shows the relationships and approximate dates of divergence of the species. The phylogeny was reconstructed based on 16S and 18S rDNA sequences, and the expected divergence was calculated as a function of time, 1â€“2% per 50 MYA. The right tree shows the relationships among species based on pyr redox protein. The circles on the nodes indicate the radiation of Legionella spp. (33 MYA) and the separation of gamma-Proteobacteria spp. (267 MYA)."
