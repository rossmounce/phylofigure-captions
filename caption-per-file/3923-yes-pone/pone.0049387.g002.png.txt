"pone.0049387.g002.png","A chladogram of Rab family members from C. elegans and H. sapiens.The evolutionary history was inferred using the Neighbor-Joining phylogenetic reconstruction method. The tree is rooted with the natural outlying clade, Rab28. The optimal tree is shown with the percentage of replicate trees (>40) in which the associated genes cluster together in the bootstrap test (500 replicates) provided next to each branch. The tree is drawn to emphasize topology. The evolutionary distances were computed using the JTT amino acid substitution method and are in the units of the number of amino acid differences per site. Evolutionary analyses were conducted using MEGA5. Clades marked with red, orange or yellow circles indicate their degree of stability under a variety of phylogenetic reconstruction parameters (see text and methods for details). Red = 14/14, orange = 13/14 and yellow = 12/14 trees. Genes highlighted with black circles represent putative orphan C. elegan Rabs (lacking a human ortholog). For simplicity, closely related splice variants and well-supported human-specific clades were deleted (see methods for details)."
