"pone.0030082.g002.png","Phylogenetic and phylogeographic relationships in C. kerkyrensis. Colors are as in Figure 1; haplotype codes match those in Table 2. In A) the ML haplotype phylogram is shown. Numbers at nodes are statistical supports for the Bayesian, NJ and ML searches (first, second and third value, respectively); only values ≥75% are reported. The three geographical clusters are described in the text. Panel B) depicts the haplotype networks for the three geographical clusters. Only connections with a probability ≥95% are shown. The relative size of circles is proportional to the number of individuals (indicated by the numbers in parentheses) carrying that particular haplotype; black dots represent missing haplotypes. Haplotypes are always one mutational step away from each other irrespective of the length of the branch between them."
