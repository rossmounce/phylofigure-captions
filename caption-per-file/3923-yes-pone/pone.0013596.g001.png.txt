The Concept of GDDA-BLAST and Adaptive GDDA-BLAST.This schematic depicts the work flow of GDDA-BLAST and Adaptive GDDA-BLAST (i–ii) The algorithm begins with a modification of the query amino acid sequence via the insertion of a “seed” sequence from the profile of interest. These seeds are obtained from the profile consensus sequences from NCBI's Conserved Domain Database (CDD). GDDA-BLAST inserts a seed at every query amino acid position; in constrast, Adaptive GDDA-BLAST inserts a seed at the positions where the seed is likely to be extended to an alignment. (iii–iv) The signals are collected from the optimal alignments between the “embedded” sequences and profiles using rps-BLAST or Adaptive GDDA-BLAST; and, they are incorporated as a composite score into an N by M data matrix. (v–ix) This dataspace can be analyzed to generate phylograms and dendrograms based on the Euclidean distance and Pearson correlation measures on alignment profiles of query proteins, respectively."
