"pone.0058008.g002.png","Phylogenetic analysis of the A. nidulans protein kinases.Kinase domain alignment generated using ClustalW (http://www.phylogeny.fr) and tree visualization using MEGA version 5 maximum likelihood analyses. Domains of the atypical PIKK, PDHK and histidine kinases were omitted. The major families of kinases are indicated in different colors. The Ffk kinases are indicated in red. Note that FfkB, FfkC, FfkD, FfkE, FfkI, FfkJ and FfkK are more similar to each other than to other kinases."
