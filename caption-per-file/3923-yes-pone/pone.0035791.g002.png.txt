"pone.0035791.g002.png","The evolutionary history was inferred using the Neighbor-Joining method.The optimal tree with the sum of branch length  = 2.38 is shown. The percentage of replicate trees in which the associated taxa clustered together in the bootstrap test (2000 replicates) are shown next to the branches. Boot strap values below 70% were considered insignificant and are not shown. The tree is drawn to scale, with branch lengths in the same units as those of the evolutionary distances used to infer the phylogenetic tree. The evolutionary distances were computed using the Kimura 2-parameter method and are in the units of the number of base substitutions per site. The analysis involved 42 nucleotide sequences. Codon positions included were 1st+2nd+3rd+Noncoding. All positions containing gaps and missing data were eliminated. There were a total of 260 positions in the final dataset. Bold sequences represent strains from current study."
