"pone.0088837.g003.png","Maximum likelihood dN/dS ratios under the five-ratio-group-branch-model.The displayed phylogeny is an unrooted tree of 12 Prochlorococcus and 2 sister Synechococcus and an outgroup Synechococcus RCC307. The branches are drawn in proportion to their length. They are defined as the expected numbers of nucleotide substitutions per site, which is estimated from the concatenation of 100 conserved amino acid sequences by using the no-clock model. The tree topology, but not the branch lengths, is used to calculate the maximum likelihood dN/dS ratios. The ancestral branches are labeled below the branches (o: outgroup, 1?9). The maximum likelihood estimates of dN/dS ratios under a five-ratio-branch-model are reported on the corresponding branches. This model divides the tree into 5 ratio groups: ?0?=?all Synechococcus branches; ?1?=?branch #2; ?2?=?branch #6 and P.MIT9303 clade; ?3?=?branch #4; ?4?=?Prochlorococcus background ratio (i.e., branch #1, branch #3, branch #7 and P.SS120 clade, branch #8 and P.NATL clade, branch #5, branch #9 and the entire Prochlorococcus HL clade). Branches for which no value is shown have the same ratios as their immediate ancestral branches."
