"pone.0005758.g006.png","Phylogeny of SAM-dependent methyltransferase.Unrooted ML phylogenetic tree of a putative STX+ specific S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM)-dependent methyltransferase that has a potential Bacillus-like origin. ML bootstrap values (when â‰¥50%) are indicated at the nodes. The branch lengths are proportional to the number of substitutions per site (see scale in the figure). Cyanobacterial taxa are shown in blue text, non-cyanobacterial prokaryotes in black text, and eukaryotes (Plantae) in green."
