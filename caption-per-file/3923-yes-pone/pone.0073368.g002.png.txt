"pone.0073368.g002.png","A comparison of topologies from our DNA barcoding analyses with topologies from multigene analyses for 5 genera of squamates with endemic Comoran lineages.Nodes with at least two values out of Bayesian PP, ML bootstrap, or Parsimony bootstrap support ≥ 90% are marked with filled black circles, nodes with at least one value out of Bayesian PP, ML bootstrap, or Parsimony bootstrap support ≥ 90% are marked with empty black circles. If only a single support value is available for the phylogeny, black circles filled with grey mark nodes with support values of ≥ 90%, and 'X' mark nodes with support values of ≥ 80%. The topologies were cropped to highlight lineages that are endemic to a single island, marked by color. Lineages that are present in the Comoros, but not endemic, are not highlighted. The multigene topologies are taken from the following studies: Cryptoblepharus[25], Ebenavia (unpublished data by O. Hawlitschek), Lycodryas[31], Paroedura[31], Phelsuma[27]."
