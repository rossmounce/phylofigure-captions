Neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree of the protease-producing bacteria recovered from eight sampled sediment stations in Maxwell Bay, King George Island based on the 16S rDNA sequences.Branch 1 indicates 23 Bacillus strains similar to Bacillus sp. Nj-19 (AM491453). Branch 2 indicates 7 Pseudoalteromonas strains similar to Pseudoalteromonas arctica (DQ787199). Branch 3 indicates 21 Flavobacterium strains similar to Flavobacterium degerlachei (AJ557886) and Flavobacterium degerlachei (EU000231). Branch 4 indicates 6 Psychroserpens strains similar to Psychroserpens sp. A622 (AY781191). Branch 5 indicates 13 Lacinutrix strains similar to Lacinutrix sp. E4-9a (FN377744). The neighbor-joining phylogenetic trees of strains in Branch 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 based on the 16S rDNA sequences are shown in Figures S1, S2, S3, S4 and S5, respectively."
