"pone.0054178.g002.png","Phylogenetic relationships among all I?B family members determined using the NJ method.A total of 328 protein sequences were included in this analysis. Bootstrap scores higher than 70% have been provided. The sponge Amphimedon queenslandica was considered as an outgroup. The clustering of I?B family members into 5 major clades is shown. Each I?B member is represented by a unique color in the phylogenetic tree: I?B? (magenta), I?B? (red), I?B? (cyan), I?BNS (dark green), I?B? (brown), Bcl3 (purple), Cactus (orange), Relish (black), NF-?B1 (blue) and NF-?B2 (light green). Taxa terminologies are presented as the I?B protein name followed by an abbreviated form of the species name. Please refer to the Results section and Table S1 for their description and species names, respectively."
