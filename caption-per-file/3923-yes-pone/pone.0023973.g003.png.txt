"pone.0023973.g003.png","Phylogenetic tree of Fe-ADH proteins. Coloration is according to 16S rRNA gene phylogeny, as shown in the boxed legend. Bootstrap values were omitted for clarity; nodes with less than 60% support were collapsed. Arrows indicate Fe-ADH proteins for which methanol dehydrogenase activity has been demonstrated experimentally. Scale bar  = 0.4 changes per position."
