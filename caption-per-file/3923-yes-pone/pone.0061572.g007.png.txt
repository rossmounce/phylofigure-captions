Comparison of sensitivity of MSA-based and ISM-based phylogenetic tree to mutations.Mutations which are potentially important for human tropism of Egyptian H5N1-HPAIV are included to test the sensitivity of MSA- and ISM-based approach to mutations. (a) The MSA tree and (b) the ISM tree for all 311 unmutated H5N1-HPAIV HA1 sequences belonging to G1 viruses; (c) the MSA tree of panel (a) in which each second sequence was mutated and (d) the ISM tree which corresponds to the mutated and unmutated sequences presented in panel (c). H5N1-HPAIV HA1 sequences selected for mutations D43N, S120D, S129Î” and I151T are in red."
