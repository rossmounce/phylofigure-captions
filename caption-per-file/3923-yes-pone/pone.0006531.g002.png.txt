"pone.0006531.g002.png","Phylogeny of proteobacterial XerC and XerD recombinases.Representative proteobacterial species of each taxon were selected for the analysis (Table 1). β-proteobacterial species are represented in blue, with γ in red, δ in green, α in magenta and ε in black. Amino acid sequence alignments were performed using Clustal W (MEGA 4 [60]). The evolutionary history was inferred by using the Neighbor-Joining method [61] conducted in MEGA4. Similar results were obtained using the Minimum Evolution method (data not shown). Only significant bootstrap values (≥90%) obtained with 1000 runs are indicated next to the branches (white with a grey background). The tree is drawn to scale, with branch lengths (below the branches) in the same units as those of the evolutionary distances used to infer the phylogenetic tree. Branch lengths below the value 0.05 are not shown. The evolutionary distances were computed using the Poisson correction method and are given as the number of amino acid substitutions per site."
