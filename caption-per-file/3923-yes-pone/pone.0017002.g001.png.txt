Genetic relationships between population pairs of Tibetan and others. (A) The ancestry sharing proportion of 497 individuals (from the 19 world-wide populations) inferred with frappe at K = 5 and K = 6, using 165,073 loosely linked autosomal SNPs. Each vertical line represents an individual and is composed of colored segments whose lengths represent the individual's coefficients in K speculated ancestral groups. (B) The ancestry sharing proportion of 167 individuals (from the 8 EA populations) at K = 6, using 165,073 autosomal SNPs. (C, D) Principal component analyses of population structure on the 19 worldwide populations (C) and the 8 East Asian populations (D), using 509,491 autosomal SNPs. (E) Neighbor-joining phylogenic tree of the 497 individuals of 19 world-wide populations, using 165,073 autosomal SNPs. The color of each individual was assign according to their population affiliation. C.S. Asia: South/Central Asia, YRI: Yoruban in Ibadan, CHB: Han Chinese in Beijing, JPT: Japanese in Tokyo."
