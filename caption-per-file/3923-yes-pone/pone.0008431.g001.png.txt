"pone.0008431.g001.png","Alignment of the HA1 portion of the HA molecule of H1 influenza viruses.The amino acid sequences were aligned using Clustal_X [34], [35], and the phylogenetic tree was generated by the neighbor-joining method using the tree drawing program NJ plot [36]. The scale represents the number of substitutions per nucleotide. Branch labels record the stability of the branches over 100 bootstrap replicates. Only bootstrap values â‰¥60% was shown in each tree. The A/California/04/2009 virus shares about 70% and 88.4% amino acid sequence homology with the seasonal human (A/Brisbane/59/2007*) and Korean swine (A/Swine/Korea/CAN01/2004+) H1N1 viruses, respectively."
