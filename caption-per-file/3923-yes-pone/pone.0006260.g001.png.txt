hTectonin is distantly related to the invertebrate Tectonins.(A) The phylogenetic tree constructed after a PSI-Search query using the invertebrate Tectonins revealed K1358 family of proteins as closely related Tectonin domain containing proteins in the mammals and also in lower species like the frog. The numbers at the nodes are an indication of the level of confidence for the branches as determined by bootstrap analysis (1000 bootstrap replicates). (B) Bioinformatics domain analysis utilizing SMART [22], [23] shows existence of Tectonin domain-containing proteins both in invertebrates and vertebrates from the horseshoe crab lectins, worm, up to humans. Of interest in this study is the protein hTectonin (red asterisk) which appear to have homologues in other species as well, for example in P. troglodytes (chimpanzee), P. pygmaeus (orangutan), M. musculus (mouse), G. gallus (chicken), C. elegans (worm) and D. melanogaster (fruitfly)."
