Phylogenetic network of clades of the IncP-1 plasmid family.The network is based on representative plasmids from each of the twelve previously described phylogenetic clades of the IncP-1 plasmid family. The network is based on the genetic segment harboring the traC - traM genes for all analyzed plasmids. The two plasmids pMCBF1 and pMCBF6 described in this study are highlighted in bold. Clades without designated names are marked with *. Previously described intra-clade recombinants [1] were not included in the analysis. The figure is updated from [1]."
