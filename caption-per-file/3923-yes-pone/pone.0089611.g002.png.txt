Neighbor-joining (NJ) tree based on population-genotyped HIV sequences from 690 pre-therapy subjects.High-confidence VTCs are labeled in red (1?30). These VTCs all represent 2 or more clustered subjects with a minimum confidence level of 95% in the (1000 bootstrap NJ replicates) for both population and UDS datasets. VTCs predicted only by the population or UDS data are shown in green and blue, respectively. VTCs where sequences are subsets of population or UDP VTCs have multiple colored labels. A more detailed phylogenetic tree with the OTUs labeled appears in Figure S1."
