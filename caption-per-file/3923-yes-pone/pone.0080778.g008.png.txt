Phylogenetic position of Djebelemur in a high-level primate phylogeny with a cladistic assessment of the craniodental and postcranial evidence performed with a molecular scaffold.A?B, consensus trees (A, Strict; B, Majority Rule at 60%) of 506 equally most-parsimonious trees of 3903 steps each (CI?=?0.147; RI?=?0.564), which were obtained after analyses performed considering some ordered characters; C, consensus tree (Majority Rule at 80%) of 116 equally most-parsimonious trees of 3608 steps each (CI?=?0.158; RI?=?0.539), which were obtained after analyses performed considering all characters unordered. The molecular scaffold [47] was used to recover those primate clades that are supported by genomic sequences. This gene-based tree of modern taxa (Perelman et al. [28]) strongly supports the monophyly of Malagasy Lemuriformes (including a Lemuridae clade, a Lepilemur-Cheirogaleidae clade, and an Indriidae clade) and that of the Lorisiformes (including a Galagidae clade and a Lorisidae clade with an Arctocebus-Perodicticus subclade and a Loris-Nycticebus subclade). On the Majority Rule consensus trees (B and C), the values above or below the nodes correspond to the rates (%) of node occurrences across the whole equally most-parsimonious trees found. The molecular scaffold used here is as follows [28]: (Scandentia, ((((Varecia, (Eulemur, (Lemur, Hapalemur))), (Lepilemur, (Cheirogaleus, (Microcebus, Mirza))), (Propithecus, Avahi)), (((Loris, Nycticebus), (Perodicticus, Arctocebus)), (Galago, Otolemur))), (Tarsius, (Saimiri, Aotus))))."
