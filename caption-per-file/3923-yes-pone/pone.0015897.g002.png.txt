Phylogenetic trees of archaeal 16S rRNA gene sequences from rhizosphere soil samples from soybean grown at ambient and elevated [CO2]. The colored bars represent the relative abundances of representative sequences from individual plots for each [CO2] treatment (Table S1). Each colored bar in each phylogenetic tree represents data from a different plot. Starting from the root, the colors for the leaf ranges indicate crenarchaeota group 1.1a (green), crenarchaeota group 1.1c (dark blue), euryarchaeota (tan), and crenarchaeota group 1.1b (light blue). Clusters within crenarchaeota group 1.1b were further divided into arbitrarily named groups as shown (e.g. 1.1b_1). Only branches with bootstrap support >60 are shown, and identical branch lengths are shown."
