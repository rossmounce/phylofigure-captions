"pone.0047179.g003.png","Phylogenetic relationships of multiple genotypes of influenza B viruses from 2007 to 2012 in Taiwan based on the complete sequences of (A) PB1, (B) PB2, (C) PA, (D) HA, (E) NP, (F) NA, (G) MP and (H) NS.The phylogenetic trees were constructed using the neighbor-joining method with 1000 bootstrap replications. Branch values of more than 70 are indicated. The complete genome sequences of the representative TW08-I, TW08-II and TW08-III viruses isolated from 2007 to 2012 and those of viruses that circulated in Taiwan and in other countries from 1994 to 2007 for which sequences were available from NCBI were analyzed and compared. The reference strains B/Victoria/02/1987 and B/Yamagata/16/1988 and the vaccine strains B/Florida/4/2006 and B/Wisconsin/01/2010 were also included in the analyses. The classification of specific evolutionary clades is indicated. The specific amino acid residues in the HA genes of each genotype were as the following: 178E for TW01; 144N, 194V, 247A and 270R for TW04-I; 266M for TW04-II; 63K, 123A and 266M for TW08-I; 165I, 180Y, 244D and 266M for TW08-II; and 244S and 266M for TW08-III."
