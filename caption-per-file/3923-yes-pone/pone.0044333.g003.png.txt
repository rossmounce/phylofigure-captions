"pone.0044333.g003.png","Phylogenetic analysis of clinical isolated virus strain CNGZD.A neighbor joining phylogenetic tree was built by Mega 4.1 based on full length sequences of clinical isolated virus strain CNGZD and different pure subtypes and CRFs. The Kimura 2-parameter substitution model was used and bootstrap values (1000 replicates) higher than 50 were shown next to the nodes of the tree. J.SE. SE9280 with long distance to CRF07_BC was selected as an outgroup in the phylogentic tree. Subtype references were downloaded from the Los Alamos HIV database (http://hiv-web.lanl.gov). CNGZD located in a clade with the other CRF07_BC isolates. Bar: 0.002 substitutions per site."
