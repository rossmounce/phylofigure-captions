Sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis of Ps87 and homologs. (A) Sequence alignment of Ps87 and homologs from other fungi. All the Ps87 homologs were collected through NCBI blast searches. Potential signal peptides (underlined) were predicted by signalP3.0. Sequence information for alignment can be found in the GenBank data library and JGI data library under accession numbers. Fusarium graminearum, XP_388656.1; Magnaporthe oryzae XP_362169.1; Melampsora lini hesp-767, ABB96277.1; Melampsora laricis-populina, EGG10381.1; Mycosphaerella graminicola, EGP88947.1; Puccinia graminis f. sp tritici, XP_003322973.1; Pyrenophora tritici-repentis, XP_001932799.1; Verticillium albo-atrum, XP_003000816.1; Verticillium dahliae, EGY16300.1; Ustilago maydis, XP_759190.1; Alternaria brassicicola jgi|5010; Cochliobolus heterostrophus, jgi|C88918; Mucor circinelloides, jgi|34515; Tremella mesenterica, jgi|67185. (B) Phylogenetic analysis of Ps87 and its homologs in diverse plant pathogens. Homologs with signal peptide HMM prediction scores higher than the value of hesp-767 are labeled as Y, else they are marked N. The phylogenetic relationship was inferred using the neighbor-joining method."
