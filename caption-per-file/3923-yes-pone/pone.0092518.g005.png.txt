"pone.0092518.g005.png","Phylogenetic affiliation of 16S rRNA gene sequences representing OTUs and DGGE bands to the Betaproteobacteria.Maximum likelihood trees showing the phylogenetic affiliation of OTU and DGGE band sequences to the Betaproteobacteria. Sequences obtained from DGGE bands are depicted in bold letters. Numbers at roots represent bootstrap values (â‰¥70%) of 100 re-samplings. Scale bars: 0.1 nucleotide substitutions per site. Sequences representing OTUs are assigned as follows: SW: South West basin, 06, 08: year of in situ experiment in 2006 or 2008, fl: free-living bacteria, pa: particle-attached bacteria. Sequences signed with EUB, Beta, or Actino are from Bacteria, Betaproteobacteria, or Actinobacteria-specific RT-PCR DGGE bands, respectively."
