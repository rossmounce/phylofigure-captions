Phylogenetic analysis of the five EPSPS and related proteins.The phylogenetic tree was based on homologous sequences of the EPSPS proteins and the neighbor-joining methods (MEGA4.0). The percentage of the tree from 1000 bootstrap resamples supporting the topology is indicated when above 50. Accession numbers or international patent publication numbers are shown in parentheses. The scale bar represents 0.1 substitutions per position."
