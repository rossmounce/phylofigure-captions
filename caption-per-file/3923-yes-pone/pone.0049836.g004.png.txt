Diversity of serine/threonine protein kinase receptor gene and SET domain-containing protein gene.4a: The phylogenetic tree of serine/threonine protein kinase receptor proteins from several plant species. GRMZM2G119714, which encodes a serine/threonine protein kinase receptor, is clustered into a different clade from Bif2, a known serine/threonine protein kinase in maize. 4b: The nucleotide and amino acid variation of serine/threonine protein kinase receptor protein between Ye478 and SL57-6. 4c: The nucleotide variation of SET domain-containing protein genes between Ye478 and SL57-6."
