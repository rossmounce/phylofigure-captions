"pone.0017300.g001.png","Phylogenic trees of strains based on the genomic rearrangements using different reference genomes (A and B) or on the sequences of 4 groups of each 10 concatenated genes (I–IV). A. using reference genome from strains J99, HPAG1, Shi470 or P12. B. using reference genome from strains 26695, B38, 51, 52 or G27. A10-A16 represents the ancestor genome structure at different evolutionary stage and A16 is the last common ancient of H. pylori. I–IV represents the phylogeny inferred from each group of 10 concatenated core genes."
