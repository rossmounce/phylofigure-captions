Phylogenetic trees showing the phylogenetic positions of the Miyazaki-Bali/2007 strain and other orthoreovirus strains based on deduced amino acid sequence of the sigma C protein (A), major inner capsid protein (B), sigma NS protein (C), and major outer capsid protein (D) listed in Table 1.Bootstrap values for each node are shown by the robustness of the tree. Miyazaki-Bali/2007, the strain isolated in the patient of the present study, is indicated in red font."
