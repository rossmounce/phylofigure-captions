HSV-1 timescale estimation based on the genes US7 and US8. Estimated timescale for the HSV-1 evolution. Each major branch point in the phylogenetic tree is marked with a dotted line to the scale-bar below. The 95% confidence intervals for each predicted time since divergence are denoted with purple bars. The increased number of branch points in each clade is highlighted with green background. Posterior probabilities for the major clades are shown."
