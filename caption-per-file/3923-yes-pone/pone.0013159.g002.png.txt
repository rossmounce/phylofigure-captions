"pone.0013159.g002.png","NJ phylogenetic tree of β2M protein sequences representing whole organisms.The phylogenetic tree shown is the collapsed tree of 55 sets of sequence data. This tree shows that β2M sequences are clustered together according to their taxons. β2M sequences from Eutheria are clustered together and consist of sequences from Primates, Equine, Rodents, Ruminants, SscQ07717, OcuP01885 and FcaQ5MGS7. Marsupials, Monotremes and Avians are the intermediate taxons between Eutheria and Fish. Amphibian Xla protein Q9IA97 is clustered together with Actinopterygii fishes while the outgroup in this tree is a cartilaginous fish Reg Q8AXA0. The divergence of fish and mammalian β2M received a high bootstrap value (89) to support the reliability of this phylogenetic tree."
