"pone.0047075.g001.png","Maximum-likelihood phylogenetic trees of 16S rRNA variable regions for selected Staphylococcus spp.(A) Diagram of the 16S rRNA gene with variable regions 1–9 indicated in gray. Amplification primers are shown as triangles. The 300 nt subsequences used to construct the trees are boxed. The phylogenetic trees shown were generated for the Staphylococcus species in the reference database and are based on the (B) full-length sequence (C) V1-3 region and (D) V3-5 region. Four staphylococcal species are shown on the tree for clarity. However, 40 staphylococcal species such as S. hominis, S. capitas, S. haemolyticus, S. saprophyticus, S. carnosus were included in the full analysis. Full strain names are: S_aureus-1 =  Staphylococcus aureus USA300 TCH1516 (NC_010079); S_aureus-2 =  Staphylococcus aureus USA300 FPR3757 (NC_007793); S_epidermidis-1 =  Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228 (NC_004461); S_epidermidis-2 =  Staphylococcus epidermidis RP62A (NC_002976); S_lugdunensis  =  Staphylococcus lugdunensis HKU09-01 (NC_013893); S_pseudintermedius  =  Staphylococcus pseudintermedius HKU10-03 (NC_014925). Lower case letters indicate independent copies of the 16S rRNA operon."
