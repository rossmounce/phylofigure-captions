"pone.0052784.g005.png","Phylogenetic analysis of PsWRKY.phylogenetic tree of PsWRKY and selected WRKY family proteins from other plant species was constructed by Neighbor joining method using MEGA5 software. The statistical reliability assessed by bootstrap value provided along with the tree. Selected WRKY proteins, respective plant species and GenBank accession numbers are as follows: Nbdouble WRKY [Nicotiana benthamiana double WRKY, Accession no. BAI63296.1], NtWRKY2 [Nicotiana tabacum, Accession no. BAA77383.1], NaWRKY3 [Nicotiana attenuata, Accession no. AAS13439.1], CaWRKY [Capsicum annuum, Accession no. ABD65255.1], StWRKY [Solanum tuberosum, Accession no. BAI63294.1], SPF1 protein [Ipomoea batatas, Accession no. ABD65255.1], MtWRKY [Medicago trucatula, Accession no. XP_003615949.1], CrWRKY1 [Catharanthus roseus, Accession no. ADT82685.1]."
