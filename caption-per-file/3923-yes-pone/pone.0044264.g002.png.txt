Bayesian phylogenetic tree of predicted metazoan tRNase Zs.This analysis is based on the sequence alignment of the full-length metazoan tRNase ZSs with the C-terminal half of metazoan tRNase ZLs. The accession number for each candidate tRNase Z is identified in Table S1. Bayesian posterior probabilities are indicated at the nodes. The scale bar indicates 0.1 nucleotide substitutions per site. Taxonomic designations are indicated on the right side of the tree."
