"pone.0032123.g005.png","Characteristics of N. caninum isolates. NeighborNet phylogenetic network for the N. caninum isolates included in this study was based on multilocus genotypes determined by 9 microsatelite markers (MS4, MS5, MS6a, MS6b, MS7, MS8, MS10, MS12 and MS21) [18], [22]. Phylogenetic network analysis was developed using the shoftware SplitsTree4 (v 4.11.3). N.caninum isolates included the Spanish isolates: Nc-Spain 3H, Nc-Spain 4H, Nc-Spain 6, Nc-Spain 7 and Nc-Spain 9, which were obtained from asymptomatic calves [22]. Nc-1 was obtained from a clinically affected dog in the United States [19], Nc-Liverpool from a clinically affected dog in the United Kingdom [20] and Nc-SweB1 from a stillborn calf in Sweden [21]. The asterisk (*) indicates isolates obtained from asymptomatic animals. The percentages represent neonatal mortality and vertical transmission rates, respectively. The rates were determined in previous studies using a pregnant BALB/c mouse model [16 and unpublished data]. The letter “V” indicates highly virulent isolates according to the significant differences found in neonatal mortality. The rest of the isolates could be considered as lowly/moderately virulent [16]."
