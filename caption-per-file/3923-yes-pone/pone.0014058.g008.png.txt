A phylogenic tree of EcR-A and EcR-B genes in insects and other organisms.A phylogenic tree was constructed using the Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis (MEGA) software version 4.1 with the sequences obtained from GenBank. The robustness of each cluster was verified in 50,000 replicates. The scale on the x-axis represents the estimated branch lengths and numbers indicate the bootstrap values."
