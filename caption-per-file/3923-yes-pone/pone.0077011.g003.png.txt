"pone.0077011.g003.png","Bayesian mtCOII phylogeny of P. piseki – P. gracilis clade A, with sub-groups A1 and A2 as shown.Bayesian posterior probability values are given above the branches, and bootstrap values from ML analysis are given below the branches, when that node was supported in both Bayesian and ML analyses. Bold text indicates haplotypes that were sampled more than once. The scale bar units are in substitutions per site. Sample identifiers begin with the ocean basin that individuals were sampled from, IO = Indian Ocean, NP = North Pacific, SP = South Pacific, NA = North Atlantic, SA = South Atlantic. Shape symbols indicate morphological traits, as defined in the legend."
