Phylogenetic analyses of the condensation and epimerase domains from the Nodularia spumigena CCY9414 aeruginosin gene cluster.The condensation domain of AerB clusters with the starter condensation domains of nostopeptolide (NosA) and cyanopeptolin (McnA) which load short chain fatty acids and forms a well-supported group. The phylogenetic tree includes all condensation subtypes, including condensation (LCL, DCL), condensation and heterocyclization catalyzed by heterocyclization domains, epimerization followed by condensation catalyzed by a Dual E/C domain, and loading condesation domains which are found on initiation modules [29]. The phylogeny was reconstructed using phyml, employing the JTT model of amino acid substitution and a gamma-distributed rate variation with four categories. The support values are based on 100-fold bootstrapping."
