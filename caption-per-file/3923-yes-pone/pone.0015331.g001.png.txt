Sequence analysis of cofilin 1. (A) Amino acid sequences of zebrafish Cfl1 (NP_998806) was aligned with their orthologs of other species, including nematode (UNC-60, NP_503427), fruit fly (TSR, NP_477034), western clawed frog (xCfl1, AAH67328), bovine (bCFL1, NP_001015655), rat (rCFL1, NP_058843), human (hCFL1, NP_005498), mouse (mCFL1, NP_031713), fugu (fCfl1, ENSTRUP00000031388) and medaka (meCfl1, ENSORLP00000002617) using Vector NTI 10.3 software. Identical amino acids across all and some species are shaded in black and gray, respectively. (B) Similarity table of Cfl1 amino acid sequences of different species. (C) Phylogenic tree of Cfl1 amino acid sequences of different species. Both similarity tables and the phylogenic tree were generated by MEGA 4.0 software. (D) Syntenic analysis of zebrafish cfl1 shows the similarity in chromosomal positions with human and mouse orthologs. (E) Sequence domain analysis of zebrafish Cfl1 with a putative phosphorylation site (P) and a nuclear localization sequence (NLS). The α-helices are shown in shaded boxes, and β-sheets are presented as open arrows. (F) Three-dimensional ribbon structure of Cfl1. N, N-terminus; C, C-terminus; NLS, nuclear localization sequence (boxed region with a red boundary)."
