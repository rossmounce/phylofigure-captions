16S rRNA gene phylogenetic tree of bacterial strains isolated from New Zealand native legumes and selected Mesorhizobium type strains.Ca?=?Carmichaelia australis; Cm?=?Carmichaelia monroi; Cn?=?Carmichaelia nana; Co?=?Carmichaelia odorata; Cp?=?Carmichaelia petriei; Clp?=?Clianthus puniceus; Mn?=?Montigena novae-zelandiae. ? indicates strains focussed on in current study. Numbers on branches are bootstrap % from 500 replicates (shown only when ?50%). The tree was rooted with the Bradyrhizobium elkani type strain."
