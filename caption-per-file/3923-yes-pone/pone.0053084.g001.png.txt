Phylogenies of the host B. tabaci cryptic species and their P-endosymbionts.A. Phylogenetic tree reconstruction based on mtCOI sequences (length = 830 bp) of host B. tabaci cryptic species using ML analysis under the HKY+G substitution model. The bootstrap values are indicated. Bemisia afer (GU 220055) is used as outgroup. Accession numbers for Btab1-19 submitted to GenBank are JX428681–JX428696. All mtCOI sequences of host B. tabaci cryptic species used in this study were clustered with other blast references sequences from GenBank and their ML phylogenetic reconstruction is shown Fig. S1A. B. Phylogenetic tree reconstruction based on 16S rRNA gene sequences (length = 1100 bp) of P-endosymbionts of B. tabaci cryptic species using ML analysis under the HKY+G substitution model. The bootstrap values are indicated. Trialeurodes vaporariorum (AF400483) is used as the outgroup. Accession numbers for Ptab1-Ptab16 submitted to GenBank are JX428713–JX428731. All 16S sequences of P-endosymbionts used in this study were clustered with other blast references sequences from GenBank and their ML phylogenetic reconstruction is shown Fig.. S1B."
