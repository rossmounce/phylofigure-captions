"pone.0065873.g001.png","A minimum spanning tree (MST) illustrating evolutionary relationships between the Peruvian spoligotypes (n = 794).The phylogenetic tree connects each genotype based on degree of changes required to go from one allele to another. The structure of the tree is represented by branches (continuous vs. dotted lines) and circles representing each individual pattern. Note that the length of the branches represents the distance between patterns while the complexity of the lines (continuous, black dotted and gray dotted) denotes the number of allele/spacer changes between two patterns: solid lines, 1 or 2 changes (thicker ones indicate a single change, while the thinner ones indicate 2 changes); dotted lines, three or more changes (black dotted for 3, and grey dotted for 4 or more changes). The color of the circles is proportional to the number of clinical isolates in our study, illustrating unique isolates (sky blue) versus clustered isolates (Blue, 2–5 strains; dark blue, 6–9 strains; Bordeaux, 10–19 strains; Red, 20 and more). Note that orphan patterns are circled with the letter “o” in red. Patterns marked by an asterisk (*) indicate a strain with an unknown signature (unclassified)."
