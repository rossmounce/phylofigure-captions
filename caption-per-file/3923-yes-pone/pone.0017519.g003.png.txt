Phylogenetic analyses of eupolytin 1 and other insect serine proteases on basis of the whole precursor sequences. The phylogenetic dendrogram was constructed by the neighbor-joining method based on the proportion difference of aligned amino acid sites of the sequence. Only branches supported by a bootstrap value of at least 50% (expressed as percentage of 500 bootstrap samples supporting the branch are shown at branching points."
