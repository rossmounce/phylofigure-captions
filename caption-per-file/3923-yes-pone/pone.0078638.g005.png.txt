"pone.0078638.g005.png","Bayesian Inference tree of the scincid species sampled based on partial sequencing of the 12S and 16S rDNA genes.The phylogram was obtained using Bayesian inference. Node values are the posterior probabilities recovered from the Bayesian inference analysis. The best-fitting model inferred from the alignment of 12S and 16S rDNA gene fragments (423 bp and 467 bp respectively, both fragments concatenated 887 bp, Genbank accessions: KF589953‏-45) for the BI tree was TIM2+I+G (−lnL=−3812.3087, BIC=7868.9798). In the phylogram, a poorly-resolved monophyletic clade (BPP: 0.62) was recovered, in which P. bocourti and Lioscincus nigrofasciolatus are sister clades. There was better support for Lioscincus tillieri being a sister group to the clade containing P. bocourti and L. nigrofasciolatus (BPP: 0.87). Our results confirm those of Ineich et al. (2013); some genera are paraphylectic (e.g. Oligosoma and Lioscincus), suggesting the need for taxonomic reassessment."
