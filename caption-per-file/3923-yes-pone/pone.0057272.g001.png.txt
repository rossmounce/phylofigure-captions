Phylogenetic relatedness of ycfR, sirA, and yigG in S. enterica and their homologs in related bacterial species.Cladograms for ycfR (A), sirA (B), and yigG (C) with branch support values displayed at nodes were reconstructed using PhyML 3.0 aLRT and TreeDyn 198.3. (http://www.phylogeny.fr/) (22â€“28). Salmonella sp. and E. coli sp. are indicated by blue and green boxes, respectively. An outgroup is indicated with a red box. Blue and green arrows indicate locations of S. Typhimurium and S. Saintpaul, respectively, in the cladograms."
