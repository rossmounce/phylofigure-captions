"pone.0095056.g004.png","Phylogenetic tree of Lactobacillus spp. identified from the guts and crops of foragers.A Neighbor-Joining phylogeny was constructed using the V1/V2 region of the 16S rRNA gene of Lactobacillus spp. from alimentary tracts in this study. Published full-length Lactobacillus spp. 16S rRNA sequences from gut samples, and putative crop specific sequences (marked with an asterisk) were used for reference. Numbers at the branch nodes indicate the level of bootstrap support for 500 replicates. Representative sequence titles for each OTU (97% sequence similarity) identified in the present study are shown in bold font. Values within pie charts are the number of sequences comprising each of the six Lactobacillus OTUs containing more than 100 reads. Pie charts represent the proportion of reads in each OTU occurring in the gut (black) vs. the crop (white). Colored clades correspond to the four major groups identified in Table 4. Please note that the two Firm 4 clades typically form a single clade in phylogenies constructed from full-length 16S rRNA sequences."
