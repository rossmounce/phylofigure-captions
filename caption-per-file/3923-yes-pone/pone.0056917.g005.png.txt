"pone.0056917.g005.png","Neighbour-joining phylogram showing phylogenetic relationships between 16S rRNA gene sequences from Pulmonaria officinalis nectar-inhabiting bacteria and reference sequences of the most related type strains found in GenBank.For ease of visualization, the dataset was limited to one representative sequence (see Table 1 and 2) for each operational taxonomic unit (OTU) found in this study at a DNA dissimilarity cut-off value of 1%. Bootstrap percentages based on 1000 replications are shown at the major nodes."
