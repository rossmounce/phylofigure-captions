"pone.0011299.g001.png","Genomic structure of OsPIE1 gene and sequence alignment of OsPIE1 homologs.(A) Genomic structure of OsPIE1 and Arabidopsis PIE1 genes. The translation start and stop sites are indicated. Exons are presented as filled black rectangles, and introns or intergenic sequences are presented as solid lines. For OsPIE1, the upper diagram (“predicted”) depicts the predicted structure of the OsPIE1 gene in the RiceGE database with 21 introns and 22 exons. The lower diagram (“cloned”) represents the structure of the OsPIE1 gene cloned and verified in this study, with an extra exon within the predicted 9th intron, corresponding to nucleotides 2368 to 2437 of the genomic fragment. (B) Domains of OsPIE1. Domains are predicted by the SMART program (http://smart.embl-heidelberg.de) and the amino acid numbers of these domains are indicated. The two putative bipartite nuclear localization signals (NLS) at the N-terminal and C-terminal regions of OsPIE1 are KRQKTLEAPKEPRRPKT and KKRDLIVDTDEE KTSKK, respectively. (C) Sequence alignment of the SNF_N domains of OsPIE1, Arabidopsis PIE1, Drosophila DOMINO A, human SRCAP, and yeast SWR1. Numbers indicate the amino acid positions. (D) Sequence alignment of HELICc domain. Amino acids corresponding to the domain are underlined. Numbers indicate the amino acid positions. (E) A phylogenetic tree of OsPIE1 orthologs from several organisms. The names of organisms are indicated in parenthesis, and bootstrap values are provided for the indication of reliability for each node."
