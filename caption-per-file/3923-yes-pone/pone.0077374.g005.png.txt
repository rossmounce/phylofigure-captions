"pone.0077374.g005.png","Echinometra Bayesian inference phylogenetic reconstruction tree.Consensus tree of 170,000 trees (after burn-in) generated by MCMC analysis of 20 million generations. 544 bp long COI fragments of 189 Echinometra specimens were used in the analysis. 181 sequences were generated in the current study corresponding to five Echinometra species, and a novel Echinometra mitochondrial lineage. Sequences downloaded from GenBank represent the eight known species of Echinometra and are denoted E. sp. A, E. mathaei, E. sp. C and E. oblonga, E. insularis, E. lucunter, E. viridis and E. vanbrunti (accession numbers: AY262861, AY262940, AY262932, AY262886, AY262906; AF255471, AF255530 and AF255526, from Landry et al. [4] and McCartney et al. [7], respectively). Heliocidaris crassispina (Echinodermata, Echinoidea) (GenBank accession number: JN716400) was used as outgroup. The supporting > 50% values of 1,000 bootstrap replications of the ML analysis and the posterior probabilities of the BI analysis are shown above nodes respectively. Clades A-H are discussed in the text."
