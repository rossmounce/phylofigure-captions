"pone.0058209.g004.png","Microdiversity of Limnohabitans genus based on 40 isolated strains.The simplified phylogeny schema was build on analyses of 16S rRNA gene and IGS1 sequences. The phylogeny was constructed on the base of Bayesian algorithm with 5 million generations, when 1000 trees were removed as burnin. Bootstrap values for Bayesian probability/Maximum Parsimony/Maximum Likelihood at the branching points are given. The tree was rooted by Polynucleobacter necessarius subsp. asymbioticus. Symbol “ω” with a number stands as reference for isolated strains obtained by K. Watanabe. Question marks stands for polyphyletic groups of strains with similar morphologies. Listed habitats originate from GenBank/EMBL sequence databases."
