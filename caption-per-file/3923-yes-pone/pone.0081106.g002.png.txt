"pone.0081106.g002.png","Methodology for estimating the evolutionary relationships between individual genes and their genome.Multiple sequence alignments were performed based on the nucleotide sequences of gene X and its genome nucleotide sequences. The distance matrices were constructed from the alignments. Finally, the similarity between the two distance matrices was evaluated with a linear correlation coefficient. Note that no construction of phylogenetic trees was necessary in the calculation."
