"pone.0032332.g003.png","Bayesian phylogeography results. Maximum clade credibility tree from Bayesian phylogeography analysis showing posterior probabilities >0.6 on branch nodes. Color coding and thickness of branches indicate different dispersal rates: thicker and red colored branches correspond to higher dispersal rates, while blue and thinner branches correspond to slower dispersal rates. Numbers at the bottom of the figure indicate relative time scale in percentage from the last common ancestor. “0” indicates that no time has passed and “1” that 100% time has passed since the last common ancestor."
