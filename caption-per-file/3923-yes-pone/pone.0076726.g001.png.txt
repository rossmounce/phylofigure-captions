"pone.0076726.g001.png","Fungal tropomyosin phylogenetic tree based on Bayesian analysis.The topology of the maximum-likelihood tree showed comparable results. Bayesian posterior probabilities and maximum-likelihood bootstrap values are measures of the probability that the observed branches are ?true?, and are shown above and below the branches, respectively. All other branches had >50% posterior probabilities but were not as well supported in the maximum-likelihood analysis (bootstrap values<50%). Scale bar indicates branch length (substitutions per site)."
