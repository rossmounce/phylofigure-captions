Synteny of duplicated genes at the CYC loci in core and basal eudicots.The phylogenetic tree to the left shows the relationship of the TCP ECE genes from Arabidopsis thaliana, Prunus persica, Vitis vinifera, Solanumlycopersicum, Nelumbonucifera and Aquilegiacoerulea. Abbreviated names of collinear genes are given above (full names given in Table S4), arrows show the presence and orientation of these genes, circles represent the number of non-syntenic genes (more than two contiguous non-syntenic genes are represented by parallel lines). Genes shared by at least two CYC loci are connected. Syntenic genes with a given core eudicot CYC locus are shown in the two AcCYC loci in A. coerulea. Boxed arrows show genes at the V. vinifera CYC2 locus and the AcCYC2 locus that are in a different location and orientation on the actual genomic fragment (shown in Figure S2 and Figure 4 respectively). A reconstructed gene map for the putative eudicot ancestor is shown, highlighted in gray."
