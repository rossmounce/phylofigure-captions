Neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree of partial env gene from recently infected individuals confirmed by BED-CEIA.A, Neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree for 108 env sequences and relative reference sequences. B, Subtype C cluster from the phylogenetic tree shown in A. The scale bar indicates 10% nucleotide sequence divergence. Values on the branches represent the percentage of 1000 bootstrap replicates and bootstrap values over 70% are shown in the tree."
