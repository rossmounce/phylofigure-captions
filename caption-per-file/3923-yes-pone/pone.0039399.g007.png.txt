"pone.0039399.g007.png","Phylogenetic history of OVOL proteins using the Bayesian method. A. Full-length OVOL proteins. B. Selected region of OVOL proteins.Posterior probabilities scores are depicted by various color balls. The placozoan OVOL protein (e_gw1.4.509.1) was used as the outgroup in this phylogenetic tree. Red x indicates sequence position, which did not accord with species phylogeny. BFL: B. floridae (lancelet), SPU: S. purpuratus (sea urchin), NVE: N. vectensis (sea anemone), HRO: H. robusta (annelids), LGI: L. gigantean (molluscs) and TAD: T. adhaerens (placozoan). Trees in figures 7A and 7B are generated using the MrBayes 3.2 [53] from alignments supplied in supplementary Files S1 and S2, respectively."
