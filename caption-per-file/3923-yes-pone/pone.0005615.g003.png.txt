Genetic divergence and phylogenetic relationships for the nominate taxa of Amphiuma based on mitochondrial and nuclear genes.Matrices to the left are uncorrected pairwise sequence divergence among the three taxa with the most closely related pair highlighted in grey. Bayesian phylograms on the right describe the relationships among the three taxa, and statistical support, if any, is indicated by Bayesian posterior probabilities to the left of the slash and maximum parsimony bootstrap values to the right."
