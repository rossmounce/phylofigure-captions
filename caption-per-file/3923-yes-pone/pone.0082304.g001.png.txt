HCV molecular phylogenetic tree based on the Core sequences.The Neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree was constructed based on the Core gene containing 374 nucleotides, corresponding to 332-705 of H77 genome (NC_004102) (A). The red filled triangle indicates the 6a cluster of Heyuan HCV-infected cases; the blue filled triangle indicates the 2a cluster. Genotypes 1, 3, 4, and 5 were collapsed into black filled triangle. The subtrees of Heyuan HCV 6a cluster (B) and 2a cluster (C) display the detailed phylogenetic relations of all Heyuan HCV cases. Bootstrap values are based on 1 000 replicates and statistic values > 70% are indicated at the nodes of the corresponding branches. The scale bar unit is substitutions/site."
