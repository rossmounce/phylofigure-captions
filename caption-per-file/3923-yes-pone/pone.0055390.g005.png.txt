"pone.0055390.g005.png","Phylogeny of four chromosomal- (WD0441, WD0498, WD0754 and WD1213) and three prophage-associated (WD0596, WD0636, WD0637) ANK genes.The trees are midpoint-rooted and inferred using maximum likelihood. ML bootstrap support values inferred from 100 replicates are also presented. Bootstrap values lower than 50 are omitted. The discordant positions of strains wYak, wSan and wHa between the chromosomal- and prophage-associated ANK gene phylogenies are highlighted with asterisks. Evolutionary model parameters were estimated with Modeltest under the Akaike Information Criterion: HKY (WD0441,WD1213); TrN+I (WD0498, WD0596); TVM+G (WD0754); TrN+G (WD0636); GTR+I (WD0637)."
