Summary of previous “backbone” phylogeny results (483 taxa/19 genes), modified from Regier et al.[22]ML topology shown for degen1 (non-synonymous change only) is based on 100 GARLI searches. Bootstrap percentages are degen1 followed by nt123 (all nucleotides), based on 1000 bootstrap replicates with 15 search replicates each. Only values greater than 50% are shown. Branch lengths are arbitrary. ‘-’ = node not found in ML tree for nt123. Numbers in parentheses after taxon names indicate number of families/number of exemplars studied. Names in bold denote clades in which larvae are not typically phytophagous. Names in serif font denote clades in which adults typically bear ultrasound-detecting tympanic organs on the thorax and/or abdomen. Classification follows van Nieukerken et al. [1]."
