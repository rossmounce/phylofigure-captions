Maximum likelihood phylogram of ray-finned fish relationships based upon UCE sequences.All nodes except for two (indicated by arrows) supported by bootstrap proportions and Bayesian posterior probabilities 0.99. Our analysis supports a monophyletic Holostei and reveals the elopomorphs to be the earliest diverging lineage of teleosts. C1, C2, and C3 indicate clades within acanthomorphs consistent with other recent molecular studies (see Discussion)."
