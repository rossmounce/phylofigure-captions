"pone.0017767.g002.png","Phylogram and genome organization of Phytophthora PLD-likes and sPLD-likes. The phylogram shown on the left was constructed based on AA sequences. (s)PLD likes from P. infestans and P. ramorum are shown in black and gray respectively. Pseudogenes (marked by *; see Table 1 and [4]) were included in the analysis. On the right, the vertical lines represent scaffolds containing one or more (s)PLD-like genes (rectangles). The scaffold numbers are shown above or below each line. On scaffolds with two or more (s)PLD-like genes the number in each rectangle indicates the distance in kb between the start of this gene and the start of the first PLD-like gene (marked by 0) on the scaffold. (s)PLD-likes that cluster in the phylogram have the same color. Dotted lines connecting the scaffolds indicate that the genomic regions are syntenic."
