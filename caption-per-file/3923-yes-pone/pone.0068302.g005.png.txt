A phylogenetic tree obtained from sequencing analysis illustrates the microbial community of lungs of patients with stable COPD and contains 76 leafs.Different genera are denoted with different colors with two exceptions: the families Rhodocyclaceae and Lachnospiraceae represent the taxa of higher rank. Bacteria marked with red circles were detected only in COPD patients, whereas other microbes are the part of a core lung microbiome."
