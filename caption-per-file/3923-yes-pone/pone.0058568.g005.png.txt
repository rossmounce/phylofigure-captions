"pone.0058568.g005.png","Summary of phylogenetic analyses based on taxon (sub)sampling of Tineoidea.Summary phylogenetic trees are displayed with corresponding bootstrap percentages for analysis of nt123 and nt123_degen1 data sets based on different taxon subsamples for Tineoidea. For ease and focus of presentation, only relationships among strongly supported, higher-level groupings are shown (see Figure 3). These groupings are: Tine: Tineidae – Eudarcia (20 taxa total); Psych  =  Psychidae (9 taxa total); Eudarcia (currently classified within Tineidae, 1 taxon); Compsoctena (currently classified within Eriocottidae; 1 taxon); NTD: non-tineoid Ditrysia (27 taxa total); and the non-ditrysian outgroup (not shown), which consist of Palaephatidae Tischeriidae (5 taxa total)."
