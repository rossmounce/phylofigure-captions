The impact of plasmid-curing on Chlamydia sp. gene expression, regulation and virulence. This diagram outlines the gene expression and regulation and virulence phenotypes of plasmid-cured Chlamydia sp., and indicates the phylogenetic relationships of the plasmid carried by these species or strains and other genera. Data regarding phenotypic and transcriptional responses were obtained in the course of this or previous studies [3], [4], [5]. NT indicates where phenotype was not examined. The dendrogram was constructed via CLUSTAL [41] and Neighbor-joining analysis was performed using plasmid sequences from C. trachomatis D/UW-3/Cx (pCTDLC1) [42], L2/434/Bu (pL2) [43], C. muridarum (pMoPn) [44], C. caviae (pCpGP1) [45], C. psittaci pCpA1 (Lusher,M.E., Gregory,J., Storey,C.C. and Richmond,S.J., unpublished; Genebank: NC_002117, C. felis (pCfe1) [46] and the non-human pathogens C. pneumoniae LPCoLN [31] and N16 (pCpnE1) [47] to determine branching order. The outcome of this analysis did not differ from the more detailed analysis published by Mitchell et al. [31]."
