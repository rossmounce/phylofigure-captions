"pone.0060896.g002.png","Evolution of GCKR genes and hepatic GCK activity in vertebrates.Summary of information on the structure of GCKR genes and hepatic GCK activity are placed on a phylogeny of vertebrates with available genome sequences (with the common names of the species shown on the right). Higher-level taxonomic groups of species are indicated to the right, with their composition indicated by the vertical bars. The phylogenetic relationship is from Ensembl (www.ensembl.org). Xenopus laevis is added to the tree as it has an intact GCKR cDNA. Genes are labeled as intact (I), likely intact (I?) or mutated (M), with the types of mutation indicated: fs?=?frame shift, sm?=?splice mutation, ??=?deletion, and ???=?likely deletion (see Tables 2 and 3). The phylogenetic placement of gene inactivation events (?, with type of inactivation indicated) was determined by parsimony. Possible inactivations, or events with unresolved locations (i.e., on the bird lineage), are indicated by the ? symbol. Hepatic GCK activity is from references 27-31, with Y?=?activity found, N?=?no or very low activity, and nd?=?not determined."
