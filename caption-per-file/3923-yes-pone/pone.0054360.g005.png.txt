Complete mtDNA phylogenetic tree of subhaplogroups L.The tree is rooted in haplogroup L0. Mutations are scored relative to rCRS. The mutations are transitions, unless suffix (A, C, T or G) that represents the transversion is added. Insertions are marked by an ?ins? and deletions are marked by ?del? following the position of inserted or deleted nucleotide. Haplogroup names are in boldface. Haplotype names are in green. The mutations that are haplogroup diagnostic are listed below the haplogroup name. Complete mitochondrial genome sequences taken from the literature are listed in Table S1. Branches consisting haplotypes identified in Slavic populations are highlighted in green."
