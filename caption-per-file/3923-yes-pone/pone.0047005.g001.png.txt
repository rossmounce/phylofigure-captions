"pone.0047005.g001.png","Phylogenetic (A) and gene-content (B) diversity among the Escherichia strains.(A) The phylogenetic analysis was carried out based on the concatenated sequence alignment of five gene sequences using the neighbor-joining algorithm in MEGA 4.0 with default settings. (B) Escherichia strains were clustered based on the conservation pattern of 5,978 genes by a binary system (1 = presence and 0 = absence), using the CLUSTER 3.0 software [38] with Euclidean distance. Clustering was visualized in Treeview [39]. The values on the nodes of the trees represent bootstrap support from 100 replicates in both (A) and (B)."
