"pone.0073116.g005.png","Phylogenetic analyses of coreceptor binding regions of chemokine receptors.(A) Schematic diagram was made to present amino terminal region (NTR) and extracellular loops (ECLs) of CCR6 structure. Subsequently three phylogenetic trees were prepared based on NTR, ECL2 and ECL3 of 20 chemokine receptors (CKRs). Branch of CCR6 on each tree was indicated by arrow. CKRs that are reported to function as HIV/SIV coreceptors are marked by “▲”. The phylogenetic tree for NTRs of CKRs (B) showed CCR6 homologous to CXCR6. On the other hand, the tree made from ECL2s of all CKRs (C) placed CCR6 close to CX3CR1. However, the tree prepared from ECL3s of all CKRs (D) positioned CCR6 similar to CXCR6 again."
