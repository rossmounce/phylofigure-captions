"pone.0075996.g002.png","A Sample locations of the sponge Suberites diversicolor: top three maps represent distribution and frequencies of haplotypes for partial Cytochrome Oxidase I (COI) and bottom three maps of genotypes of internal transcribed spacer region (ITS) in Indonesia Singapore and Australia with insets of Berau (East Kalimantan left) and Raja Ampat (West Papua right) in Indonesia; location codes are explained in Table 2; circles represent marine lakes and squares are coastal populations; haplo/genotypes are indicated by number code (COI: C1-4 and ITS: T1-9) and color codes as provided in B. Note that scale differs per map. B Bayesian/maximum likelihood phylogram of 105 COI sequences (right) and 104 ITS sequences (left); each haplo/genotype indicated by specific color followed by location code and total number of samples in squared brackets. Only posterior probabilities of >90 and maximum likelihood values of >70 are indicated. Color blocks represent the same individuals for both molecular markers (i.e. lineage A (pink) and B (green) represented by the same individuals with both COI and ITS markers). Species of the family Halichondriidae were used for the outgroup followed by Genbank accession numbers. Scale bars indicate substitutions/site."
