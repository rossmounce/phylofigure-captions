"pone.0028676.g005.png","Multiple sequence alignment of GhSEP and other plant SEP proteins. A: Multiple protein sequence alignment of GhSEPs with other plants: Populus SEP1/2 (XP_002330922), and SEP3 (AAO49811), Arabidopsis SEP1 (NP_568322), SEP2 (NP_186880) and SEP3 (NP_850953), and Euptelea SEP (ADC79707). The MADS-box domain was highly conserved among the SEP sequences. B: A phylogenetic tree of these plant SEP proteins constructed with MEGA 4.1."
