"pone.0034459.g005.png","Cladogram of reef corals illustrating phylogenetic signal of traits.This tree represents the first of 1000 random resolutions of the strict consensus supertree. Vertical bars illustrate, in red, degrees of clumping among species classified as Vulnerable (VU) and above, susceptible and/or resistant to specific threats, and those recovering quickly from bleaching and disease. Taxa absent for the above traits are in blue. Data Deficient (DD) species, which are not phylogenetically clumped, are in black."
