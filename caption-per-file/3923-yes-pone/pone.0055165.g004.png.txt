"pone.0055165.g004.png","Phylogenetic tree illustrating the genetic relationship of nucleotide sequences for envelope protein coding genes of Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) strains identified in mosquitoes, Republic of Korea, 2010 (indicated in bold font) and reference sequences for JEV strains from other geographic regions as reported on GenBank.Genotypes of JEV strains are indicated on the right of the phylogenetic tree and were assigned according to Chen et al. [45], [46]. Bootstrap support values are shown. The scale bar indicates the number of mutations. Abbreviations for strains reported in this study are as follows: K10CT?=?Republic of Korea (ROK), 2010, Culex tritaeniorhynchus; K10CB?=?ROK, 2010, Culex bitaeniorhynchus; and K10CP?=?ROK, 2010, Culex pipiens. Vaccine strains that have been used in ROK are indicated in bold font and with an asterisk (*)."
