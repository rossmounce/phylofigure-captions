Assessing predictive power of phyloecological clustering.We added five new species to the dataset and preformed hierarchical clustering with the established parameters. The new species became a part of the clusters defined with similar environmental conditions as it is found in their respective niches. One archaeon joined the ?red? cluster with other mesophilic methanogens; two species merged with the members of halophilic ?blue? cluster; and two hyperthermoacidophilic organisms became members of the corresponding ?yellow? cluster."
