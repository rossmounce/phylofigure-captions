Unrooted Neighbour-joining tree constructed from Burkholderia 16S rRNA gene sequences, showing the phylogenetic relationship between Burkholderia dabaoshanensis sp. nov. and other Burkholeria spp.Pandoraea apista LMG16407T and Ralstonia pickettii LMG5942T was used as the outgroup. Bootstrap values (expressed as percentages of 1000 replications) greater than 50% are given at the nodes. GenBank sequence accession numbers are given in parentheses. Bar,0.01 substitutions per nucleotide position. The Minimum Evolution and Maximum Parsimony methods were also used for tree construction. Branches marked with an asterisk are conserved in all methods used."
