Phylogenetic relationships of foxtail millet WD40 proteins.The sequences were aligned by CLUSTALW at MEGA5 and the unrooted phylogenetic tree was deduced by neighbor-joining method with 1000 bootstrap replicates. The evolutionary distances were computed using p-distance method. The bootstrap values are shown at the nodes. The tree was divided into five phylogenetic cluster designated as I to V. The members of the SiWD40 were distinctly coloured to represent respective WD40 subfamilies."
