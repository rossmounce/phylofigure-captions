Inferred phylogenetic relationship among representative Babesia and Theileria species based on 18S rDNA sequences.The 18S rDNA sequences were analyzed utilizing Bayesian analysis (Bayes) and maximum likelihood (ML), using Toxoplasma gondii as outgroup. The numbers along branches indicate posterior probability (PP) and bootstrap probability (BP) values resulting from different analyses in the order: Bayes/ ML. Highly statistically supported nodes were BP≥85; PP≥0.98; while poorly statistically supported nodes were BP<60; PP<0.90."
