Maximum-Likelihood phylogeny estimated from NS5B sequences (H77 positions 8261â€“8639).Bootstrap support values are only shown for the major ancestral nodes of interest. Reference HCV sequences are indicated by genotype followed by their Genbank accession numbers. Similar phylogenetic patterns were observed for C/E1 (not shown)."
