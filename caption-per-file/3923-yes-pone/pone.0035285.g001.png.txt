Unrooted phylogenetic tree of the ssDNA-binding proteins.The SSB phylogeny was reconstructed using sequences representative of the different SSB families [28] as described in Materials and Methods. SSB proteins related to N. gonorrhoeae SsbB found in Genetic Islands or Integrated Conjugative Elements are shown in red. Other colours indicate: Eukaryotes (grey), Crenarchaea (blue), Euryarchaea (dark purple), mitochondria (light blue), Gram-negative bacteria (light purple), Gram-positive bacteria (green), Lactococcus phages (orange)."
