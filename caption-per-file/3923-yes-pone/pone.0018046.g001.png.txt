"pone.0018046.g001.png","Carnivora phylogeny, UGT1A6 mutations, and diet. Shown is a simplified phylogeny of the Carnivora species evaluated in this study, indicating the deduced timing of disruptive UGT1A6 mutations (highlighted) found within the Felidae, Hyaenidae and Phocidae lineages. Shown at specific nodes are divergence times (in MYA) defining the upper and/or lower boundaries of each mutation based on published estimates [16], [18], [19] (details provided in Table 1). The inferred diets of each species based on the system proposed by Van Valkenburgh [27], [35] are denoted by the branch line color. Species were classified as hypercarnivores (>70% animal matter in diet), mesocarnivores (50-70% animal matter in diet), or hypocarnivores (Tables S2 and S3. Disruptive UGT1A6 mutations are only found in species classified as hypercarnivores. Note that for unknown reasons UGT1A6 could not be amplified by PCR in any of the Otariidae evaluated (indicated by “?”), while UGT1A1 was readily amplified and sequenced in those same species."
