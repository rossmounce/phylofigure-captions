"pone.0027483.g005.png","Phylogenetic analysis of the transmitted astrovirus strains. A. A maximum-likelihood-based phylogenetic tree was computed using capsid gene sequences (corresponding to nt 4325 to 4867 of the astrovirus 4 complete genome [GenBank DQ344027] or nt 1 to 543 of the capsid gene) obtained from 8 samples collected from patient 1, one from patient 2, and two from patient 3 (Table 2). Corresponding sequences from representatives of the 8 human astrovirus serotypes (HAstV) and the divergent VMLB1 human astrovirus (HastVMLB1) were included to show a comparison of evolutionary distances and relationships. Bat astrovirus (BatAstV, in light gray) was used as an outgroup. All virus strains are shown with the corresponding GenBank accession number. The numbers of substitutions per site are indicated below the tree. Because of long branches, the outgroup BatAstV, as well as the strain HAstVMLB1, are shown with annotated branch lengths. B. Blow-up of a sub-tree from panel A marked with an asterisk showing relatively short branch lengths compared to the full tree."
