Diversity of genetic species groups displayed as an unrooted phylogram inferred from the rbcL-3P data.An asterisk indicates species included in the 2010 culture-based DNA reference library (DRL). n indicates the number of sequences generated for each genetic species group during the 2011 molecular-based survey. If no number is indicated then this taxon was encountered in the 2010 DRL only. Cryptic species pairs are indicated in bold font."
