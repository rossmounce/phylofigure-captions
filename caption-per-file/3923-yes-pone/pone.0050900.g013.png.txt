"pone.0050900.g013.png","Primary sequence analysis of novel germin-like protein from M. alba.(A) Multiple alignment of the deduced amino acid sequence of Ma-Glp with true germins and Glps from other representative plant groups as presented in Table 2. Residues shared by several germins and Glps are indicated with the following symbols: ?*?-denotes identical residues in all sequences; ?:?- conserved substitutions according to similar properties of amino acids; ?.?- semi-conserved substitutions. Dashes indicate gaps used to maximize the alignment. (B) Relationships between members of several species presented as a phylogenetic tree andin ferred using the UPGMA method. The percentage of replicate trees in which the associated taxa clustered together in bootstrap test (5000 replicates) is shown next to branches. Evolutionary analysis was conducted in MEGA 5.0. Circular representation of tree. Cones- Glp subfamily III; Triangle-Glp subfamily II; Circle- Glp subfamily I; Square- True germins (C) Percent identity matrix of the representative species as inferred using Clustal X 1.83."
