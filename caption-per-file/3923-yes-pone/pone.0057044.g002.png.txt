The phylogenetic analysis of LBD genes in apple and Arabidopsis.The amino acid sequences of the LBD proteins were aligned with Clustal X, and the phylogenetic tree was constructed using the neighbor-joining method of MEGA 5.0 software. Each node is represented by a number that indicates the bootstrap value for 1000 replicates. The scale bar represents 0.1 substitutions per sequence position. Each LBD subfamily is indicated by an arc."
