"pone.0022527.g001.png","HSV-1 phylogeny. (A) Schematic illustration of the HSV-1 genome. The thick black bar in the bottom depicts the regions that were included in the analysis after all repeat regions and gaps were removed. Nucleotide positions refer to the laboratory strain 17. (B, C, D and E) Phylogenetic networks (splits networks). Networks B and C are based only on US7 and US8, which were the genes analyzed previously by Norberg et al [8]. All strains with recombination crossovers in this region were excluded in order to illustrate the division of the non-recombinant strains into the three distinct evolutionary clades A, B and C. Network B also includes the strains used by Norberg et al, and network C includes only the strains sequenced for this study. Network D is based on the complete genome, including only the strains used in network C (i.e. without recombination crossovers in US7 or US8). Here, recombination crossovers in other parts of the genome prohibit distinct classification of the strains into three distinct clades. Finally, network E is based on the complete genome, including all strains. The network reveals massive recombination and it is irrelevant to attempt to classify a complete genome into any of the three phylogenetic clades A, B or C. The statistical significance for recombination is shown for each dataset."
