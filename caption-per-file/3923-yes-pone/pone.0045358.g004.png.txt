Phylogenetic tree of the partial 18S rDNA gene sequences from the novel Maullinia sp. which is parasitic in Durvillaea antarctica.Maullinia sp. (JX163857) is placed within the Phagomyxida and sister to the second brown algal parasitic species of Phytomyxea Maullinia ectocarpii. The phylogenetic tree was constructed using Bayesian analyses running the GTR+I+R model with 1000000 generations (burnin = 1000). Posterior probabilities are shown above the nodes. The resolution of the branches within the Plasmodiophorida was better supported in PHYML analyses (data not shown)."
