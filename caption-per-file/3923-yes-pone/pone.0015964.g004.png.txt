"pone.0015964.g004.png","Phylogenetic trees for genome wide comparative analysis. Phylogenetic trees of seventeen bacteria based on the basis of the alignments of gene relationship networks derived from genome context information, with all branches supported at >70% bootstrap values. All notes from gene networks are homologous genes in these microorganisms, and the branches in the gene networks are constructed using three kinds of relationships: predicted by phylogenetic profiles method, gene neighbors method and gene fusions method."
