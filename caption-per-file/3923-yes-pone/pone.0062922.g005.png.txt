Protein sequence alignment of putative L. japonica HQTs and HCTs with representative members of the HQT and HCT families.A. Sequence alignment of the conserved structure motifs in eight L. japonica putative HQTs and HCTs with Solanum lycopersicum (NP001234850) and Nicotiana tabacum (CAE46932). Black boxes indicate the conserved region. B. Neighbor-joining tree of HQTs and HCTs from L. japonica and other plants. The HQTs and HCTs used in phylogenetic analysis were retrieved from NCBI, including Cynara cardunculus var. scolymus (ACJ23164, ADL62854, CAR92145, ACF37072, AFL93687, ABK79689, ABK79690, AFL93686), Coffea canephora (ABO77957, ABO47805, ABO77955), Nicotiana tabacum (CAE46932, Q8GSM7), Solanum lycopersicum (NP001234850), Trifolium pratense (ACI28534), Populus trichocarpa (XP002303858, XP002332068), P. nigra (AEN02914) and C. arabica (ABO40491)."
