"pone.0032480.g005.png","A phylogenetic tree of insect and arachnid G-protein coupled neurotransmitter receptor sequences. Amino acid sequences were aligned using Clustalw2 (European Bioinformatics Institute, Cambridge, UK). Sequence accession numbers are listed in Table S2. The radial phylogram was constructed using Dendroscope software [33]. Dopamine receptor nomenclature is as proposed by Mustard et al., (2005). Octopamine receptor nomenclature is as proposed by Evans et al., (2005). Previously undescribed putative R. microplus receptors are in larger blue type."
