A model for the evolution of mammalian X-chromosome inactivation. Arrows above the phylogeny show epigenetic features underlying X chromosome inactivation (solid arrows indicate stable components of XCI within the clades, whereas dashed lines indicate unstable repressive modification). We propose that in the ancestral therian mammal neighbouring centromeric constitutive heterochromatin histone modifications were exapted to reduce transcription from the paternal X chromosome in females. H3K27me3 and H3K9me2 were also recruited to the Xi in a cell-cycle and/or cell-lineage dependent manner. After the divergence of placental from marsupial mammals, the XIST gene evolved and H3K27me3 and H3K9me2 (along with H4K20me1) were stably recruited into the XCI machinery. In placental mammals the original silencing machinery was restricted, and organised in mutually exclusive domains with the Xi-specific facultative heterochromatin. In marsupials, much of the original silencing machinery that was recruited from constitutive heterochromatin remains in place."
