"pone.0035750.g004.png","Potential in-frame translation of unspliced introns in Candida TFB3 genes.The 5â€² end of TFB3 genes from 14 yeast species are shown, ending at a conserved region coding for the amino acid sequence DMCPICK. Exons and introns are written in upper and lower case, respectively. Gray backgrounds indicate potential in-frame translation of introns. Spliced and unspliced mRNAs have been identified in three species: C. orthopsilosis, C. parapsilosis and C. albicans. Probable intron branch sites are underlined. Upstream in-frame stop codons are boxed. Two possible alternative gene structures are shown for D. hansenii. Arrows mark two Cys residues that form part of the RING finger domain. The topology of the phylogenetic tree is from Fitzpatrick et al [126]."
