Maximum Likelihood phylogenetic tree of the studied viruses.Maximum Likelihood tree constructed with the complete genomic sequences of the studied viruses and the parental S61 virus. The tree parameters of the weighted evolutionary model were obtained previously by JModelTest and the tree was obtained by the PHYML program. Viruses grouped by lineages with some long branches. Bar represents the genetic distance."
