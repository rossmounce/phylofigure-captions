Numbers above branches refer to Bayesian posterior probabilities and bootstrap support from corresponding maximum likelihood analysis, respectively. Samples are identified with ID-numbers, geographical origin, year of sampling and life-history. Colours are corresponding to geographical regions in Figure 3. Sequences representing farmed Atlantic salmon are in black and marked with their respective GenBank accessions, county of origin and life history. Sequence from Salmo trutta is underlined."
