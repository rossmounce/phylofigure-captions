"pone.0040050.g005.png","Phylogenetic analysis of betasatellite sequences.Neighbor-joining dendrogram based upon a Clustal W alignment of selected betasatellite sequences available in the databases with the betasatellite sequences determined here (a more complete phylogenetic analysis is shown in Figure S3). The database accession numbers of each sequence are given. The acronyms and isolate descriptors are as described in [37]. The betasatellite isolates obtained from cotton spp. as part of this study are highlighted with colored boxes. The numbers at each node represent the bootstrap values (1000 replicates). The recombinant sequences for different hosts are presented in different rectangles. The representative sequences of recombinant origin are presented with their line diagram generated through RDP3 program. Note that some betasatellite species in this tree are not monophyletic due to the use of the Clustal W algorithm for the alignment (the taxonomy of betasatellites is based upon the Clustal V algorithm)."
