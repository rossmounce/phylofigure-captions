"pone.0070953.g004.png","Galaxias lineage diversity.(a) Maximum Likelihood phylogenetic estimate of relationships among mitochondrial cytochrome b haplotypes of Galaxias from the south-western CFR. Bayesian posterior probabilities are given on the branches. The numbers (1?74) represent unique haplotypes and the colours indicate lineages, corresponding to distribution maps in Figure S1 in Appendix S2. River systems in which the lineages occur are listed below the lineage names and their ranges are presented in Figure S1 in Appendix S2. (b) TCS network of cyt b haplotypes (1?74) from individuals of Galaxias from the south-western CFR. The sizes of circles are proportional to haplotype frequency, and the colours indicate the river system(s) where the haplotype occurred. Black dots represent missing haplotypes in the network. Each branch represents one mutation step."
