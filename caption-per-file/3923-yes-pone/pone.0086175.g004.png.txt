"pone.0086175.g004.png","Relative abundances and sources of the taxa detected in the 1-L tank sample.Abundances are based on the weighted average of the three sequencing replicates of 1-L tank samples. The size of the circles is proportional to the number of sequence reads, with the largest circle equivalent to 425,178 reads (50.6% of the tank sample). Tank (blue) refers to DNA that was generated within the tank. Feed (purple) includes both gel and pellet diets. Unknown (gray) refers to DNA that was detected in the tank but was not generated in the tank and did not appear in the intake or feed. The tree diagram is derived from NCBI taxonomic groupings, rather than from an evolutionary phylogenetic analysis."
