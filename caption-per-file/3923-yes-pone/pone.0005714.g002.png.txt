Phylogenetic relationship among the nucleotide sequences of the D1 regions of 105 coa.The Neighbor-Joining (NJ) tree was constructed using Clustral W and TreeView. The numbers at nodes refer to bootstrap replicates out of 1000 that support the node. Abbreviations are as follows: SC, the type of stapylocoagulase; Ser, serotype of staphylocoagulase; Rep, a number of 81-bp tandem-repeat units of coa; agr, agr type; ST, multilocus sequence type; LP in Serotype section, Staphylocoagulase production was too low to clot serum within 48 hr; NT in Serotype section, Non typable; “-” in Serotype section, Not tested; PS in Rep section, Partially sequenced; ND in agr section, Not detected by M-PCR for agr."
