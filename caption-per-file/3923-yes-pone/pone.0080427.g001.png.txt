Maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree of 218 IFNT related genes.Amino acid sequences of 218 IFNT related genes were used for the phylogenetic analysis. A scale of evolutionary distance is shown in the upper left. The percentage of 1,000 fast bootstrapping tests was shown at each split. Based on values from the fast bootstrapping test as well as gene annotations, IFNT related sequences were divided into 13 clades, each of which is compressed in a triangle in the figure. Genes in each clade is shown in Fig. S1 and Table S2."
