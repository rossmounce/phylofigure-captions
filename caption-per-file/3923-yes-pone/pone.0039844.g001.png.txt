"pone.0039844.g001.png","COI phylogeny of the three darwinulid genera.This phylogeny was obtained by Bayesian Inference. Height of triangles reflects the number of sequences. Triangles or single branches represent EG species, which are indicated by their geographic origin and Arabic numbers. Species names in red are split into two species by the GMYC method (but not by the K/Î¸ method). Species names in black are recognized by both methods. Numbers above branches are bootstrap values of 1000 replicates for NJ and ML trees (>50%), numbers below branches are posterior probabilities of Bayesian Inference."
