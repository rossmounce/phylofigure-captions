16S rRNA phylogeny of Spiroplasma from ants, lepidopterans, and other hosts.Maximum likelihood phylogeny illustrating relatedness between ant associates and various Spiroplasma symbionts. The inner-most color strip illustrates known lifestyle, with gut associates being presented in light gray, pathogens in dark gray, and heritable bacteria in black. In the outer strip, the phenotype of male-killing is illustrated. Microbes are named after their hosts. Those from ants are in bold and italics; those from lepidopterans are in bold font; and those reported from Polyrhachis in this study are indicated with an asterisk. Non-Spiroplasma clades are collapsed for brevity. Bootstrap values greater than 60 are indicated above their respective nodes."
