Inferred phylogenetic relationships among the cephalopods based on mitochondrial DNA sequences.The concatenated amino acid sequences of 13 protein-coding genes were analyzed ML, NJ, MP and TNT analysis, using Nautilus macromphalus as outgroup. The number at each node is the bootstrap probability of ML analyses. Bootstrap values generated from 1000 replicates for NL, MP and TNT analysis, while 100 replicates for ML analysis."
