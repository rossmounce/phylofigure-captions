"pone.0042349.g002.png","Fussel-Proteins and their relationship to the Ski-Sno/CORL/DACH-family.(A) Comparison of FussB and FussC proteins to Drosophila dSnoN-, human Fussel 15 and 18 and human Ski-Sno proteins. Shaded boxes show the relative positions of structural features as indicated in the legend; the scale-bar represents aminoacids. (B) Unrooted phylogenetic tree of the Ski-Sno/CORL/DACH- family. Branch length reflects phylogenetic divergence and the scale bar indicates the number of amino acid substitutions per site. Bootstrap values are given to indicate statistical significance at each node. (C) Multiple Sequence Alignment of the Ski-Sno-homology (upper alignment) and SMAD4- binding domains (lower alignment) of Drosophila and human Ski-Sno/CORL-proteins. Shading and the Clustal consensus indicates similar or identical amino acids. Height of bars reflects the quality of conservation while the symbols are denoting the conservation type: stars mark identical or conserved residues in all sequences while colons and dots indicate conserved or semi-conserved substitutions. Red arrows mark the zinc binding domain."
