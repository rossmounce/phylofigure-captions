"pone.0038217.g001.png","Neighbour-Joining tree based on the sequences of six housekeeping genes (asd, aspA, atpA, glnA, pgi and tkt) illustrating the phylogenetic relationships of oral and enteric Campylobacter concisus isolates analysed in this study.Isolates from patients with IBD are coloured red. Isolates from a healthy control are coloured blue. Clusters are indicated in roman numerals. Campylobacter curvus is used as an outgroup. Alongside the tree on the right are the MLST sequence types (ST) and protein profiles. Campylobacter concisus strain 13826 is the whole genome sequenced strain (Accession No.: CP000792.1)."
