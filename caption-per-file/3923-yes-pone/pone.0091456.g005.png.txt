Molecular phylogenetic analysis by maximum likelihood method of most common 16S rRNA pyrotags in the FeOB sample (grey color) and related sequences from the NCBI database.The number of pyrotags yielded for the respective OTU is shown in the brackets. Escherichia coli 16S sequence is used as an out-group. The numbers at nodes are bootstrap percent values based on 1000 resamplings. The scale bar corresponds to the number of substitutions per site."
