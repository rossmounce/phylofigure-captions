Bayesian inference phylogeny of plant RSHs. The tree was generated from a MrBayes analysis of 470 amino acid positions from 66 sequences. Colored sequence names indicate subgroups as follows: red – Rsh1, green – Rsh2, orange – Rsh3, blue – Rsh4, and black – bacterial Rel. Numbers on branches show support in the following format: BIPP/MLBP. Support is only shown for branches with BIPP>0.8. Branch length is proportional to the number of substitutions per site (see scale bar)."
