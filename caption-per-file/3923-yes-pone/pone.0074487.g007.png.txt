"pone.0074487.g007.png","Phylogenetic analysis of ClpV.(A) The neighbor-joining tree of T6SSs using ClpV orthologs from 348 T6SS clusters in 231 species. The 231 species are grouped according to their class, which is indicated using color lines: α for the subdivision of Proteobacteria (Pink), β subdivision (Green), γ subdivision (Blue), δ/α subdivision (Black) and other bacteria unrelated to Proteobacteria (Gray). ClpV orthologs are distributed in five clades and named I-V. Naming of clades is according to Boyer et al [86]. Each clade is contributed by different bacterial families of Proteobacteria. Our result is consistent with a previous phylogenetic analysis of T6SS using 13 T6SS conserved component genes [86]. ClpV of E. cloacae are distributed in clades II and III of the phylogenetic tree and are clustered together with other strains and species in the family of Enterobacteriaceae possessing T6SS, thus forming sub-trees in each clade (indicated by gray circles). A simplified and enlarged version of the neighbor-joining tree with bootstrap values showing (B) the sub-tree of clade III formed by ClpV orthologs associated with ECENHK_13140 and (C) the sub-tree of clade II associated with ECENHK_15865. Color squares indicate the habitats of the corresponding bacterial species: plant/ soil-associated (light green), insect-associated (green) and Human/ animal associated (orange)."
