"pone.0010631.g003.png","HCV genotype 6 phylogenetic tree of injection drug users from Yunnan province, China.Sequences analyzed here contain 306 nucleotides, corresponding to 350–655 of H77 genome. The tree was drawn with MEGA 4 (Build #4028), using Kimura 2-parameter as the model. The references were obtained from the Los Alamos National Laboratory HCV Databases (http://hcv.lanl.gov/content/index). Bootstrap values >70% are indicated at the nodes of the corresponding branches. Symbol ▪ indicates the sequence is from an IDU sample."
