Neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree drawn using 536 bp 16S rDNA sequences of 20 individuals collected in the Eastern (EP), Central (CP) and Western Pacific (WP). The homologous sequence of Panulirus japonicus (NC_004251) [21] is used as an outgroup (Pj). Bootstrap supports higher than 50% and number with a branch indicates probability for 1,000 replications. Larval samples are shown in red. Samples carrying asterisk are from Central Pacific."
