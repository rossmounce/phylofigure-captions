"pone.0065420.g001.png","Amino acid sequence alignment of GCRP and neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree for related peptides of vertebrates.A, The mature peptide sequences of GCRP were predicted and aligned along with the GIP, GCG, GLP1, GLP2, and Gila monster exendins. Conserved residues for GCRPs and related peptides are indicated by different colors as proposed by the ClustalX-2.1 program. The GCRP-specific motif at positions 16â€“18 is highlighted by red dots above the sequences. B, Neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree for GCRP-related peptides of human (hu), mouse (mo), chicken (ch), anole lizard (an), Xenopus (xe), zebrafish (zf), medaka (md), fugu (fu), stickleback (sb), and tetraodon (to) along with Gila monster exendins and human SCT, GHRH, VIP, and PACAP. The mature peptide sequences were aligned on ClustalX-2.1, and a tree was constructed with MEGA 5.05. Bootstrap numbers represent 1,000 replicates."
