"pone.0046620.g005.png","Consensus Bayesian phylogeny of the Daphnia species complex based on the mitochondrial COX1 gene.The alignment contains 52 sequences of length 552 nt with 151 polymorphic positions of which 112 are phylogenetically informative. Nine of the 12 lineages in the Daphnia pulex species complex, including all three South American lineages, are represented. The tree is rooted through the midpoint. Numbers at the nodes are Bayesian posterior probabilities and are not shown if less than 0.80. Branch colors correspond to continents as follows: green = Europe, blue = North America, red = South America. Individual CT-18 was collected from Connecticut, USA."
