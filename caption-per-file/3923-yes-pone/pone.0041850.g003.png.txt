"pone.0041850.g003.png","Phylogenetic analyses of the paralemmin protein family.A) Bootstrapped neighbor-joining tree (1000 bootstrap replicates). B) Bootstrapped phylogenetic maximum likelihood tree (100 bootstrap replicates). Species name abbreviations are applied as in Figure 2. The chromosome, scaffold (s-) or ultracontig (u-) assignments are given in the sequence names after the species abbreviations. Both trees are presented as radial unrooted trees since no invertebrate orthologs could be identified to be used as outgroup."
