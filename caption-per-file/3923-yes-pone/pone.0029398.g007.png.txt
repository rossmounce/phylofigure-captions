Phylogram of plastid SSU rDNA showing diverse types of plastids and symbionts in D. miles. Sequence obtained in this study is bold-typed. Support of nodes is based on bootstrap values of NJ/ML with 1000 and 500 resamplings, respectively. Only values greater than 60 are shown. If only one of the two phylogenetic methods yielded significant support, the other is shown with “-”. Marinomonas sp. was used as the outgroup to root the tree."
