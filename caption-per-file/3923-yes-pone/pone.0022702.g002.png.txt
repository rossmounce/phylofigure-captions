The abundance of 3% OTUs (percent of the total isolates in the culture collection) generated by using non-conventional approaches for microbial cultivation from CF sputum and the phylogenetic relationship between recovered isolates. OTUs that are represented in greater than 1% of the entire culture collection (2 015 isolates) are highlighted on the phylogenetic tree with proportionally sized solid circles according to the legend above the abundance plot. OTUs with less than 97% identity to any 16S rRNA sequence in public databases are indicated with red branches."
