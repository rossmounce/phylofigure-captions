"pone.0066853.g001.png","Phylogenetic tree of relatedness of family 71 of fungal glycosyl hydrolases (GH-71).The Mega 4 software package was employed, using ClustalW for sequence alignment. Construction of the phylogenetic tree was done by the neighbor-joining method using 1000 replications. Five groups (G1â€“ G5) are distinguished. P brasiliensis Agn1p (labeled Pb73) is located in group G1. The groups are: G1 (red), G2 (blue), G3 (black), G4 (green), and G5 (purple). GenBank accession numbers of sequences, and names of fungal species used for construction of the tree are displayed in Table 2."
