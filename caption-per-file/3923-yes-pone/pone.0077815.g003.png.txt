"pone.0077815.g003.png","Haplotype network and phylogenetic tree resulting from the analysis of the Fib7 dataset.The haplotype network reconstruction takes into account missing data and gaps, so that the inferred number of haplotypes is higher than the one presented in Table 4. Red values on nodes indicate the inferred number of mutation steps between haplotypes or ancestral haplotypes (symbolized by a red node). The absence of value means that the number of step is equal to 1. The phylogenetic tree corresponds to the results of a Bayesian inference analysis (see text for details); posterior probabilities (PP) are indicated for major nodes (values below<0.50 are not figured). On the right side, the general origin of Arvicanthis niloticus specimens is figured using circles filled with different colours that directly refer to the map presented in Figure 1."
