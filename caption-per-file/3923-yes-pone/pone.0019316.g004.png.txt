Phylogeny of clade B-associated CooS sequences. Protein phylogeny was determined by Phylip ProML maximum-likelihood analysis of 436 unambiguously aligned and filtered amino acid positions. Support for the tree was calculated by 100 bootstrap-step reanalysis of the dataset using protein maximum-likelihood methods and is reported for nodes with greater than 50% support. Sequences recovered from insect gut inventories are indicated as in figure 3. %G+C content of cooS genes for each translated CooS amino acid sequence is given parenthetically. Genes identified in the Nasutitermes sp. metagenome are indicated with clone designations as they appear in the Joint Genomes Institute Img/m database. Bar indicates distance given as 0.1 changes per amino acid position."
