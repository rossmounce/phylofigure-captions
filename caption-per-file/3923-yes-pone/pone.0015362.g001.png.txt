"pone.0015362.g001.png","Subset of bivalve phylogenetic tree present in A. Antarctica and B. the Arctic Circle in the Paleocene and Eocene. Taxa that went locally extinct in these regions in the Modern are gray-shaded, along with the internal branches removed from the tree as a result of these absences. Internal nodes are scaled to first appearance of each family in the fossil record. Numbers and bars along the right edge demark family groupings within orders, following Bieler & Mikkelsen [44], except placement of Thyasiridae outside of (Veneroida Lucinidae), following Taylor et al. [50]. 1. Solemyoida, 2. Nuculoida, 3. Nuculanoida, 4. Arcoida, 5. Mytiloida, 6. Pterioida, 7. Limoida, 8. Pectinoida, 9. Trigonioida, 10. Carditoida, 11. Anomalodesmata, 12. Veneroida, 13. Myoida."
