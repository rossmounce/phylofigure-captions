The phylogeny of partial VP1 sequences of EV-C species, including strains isolated in this study.The phylogenetic tree was constructed from partial VP1 coding region (consensus alignment 343 nucleotides) of CVA-21 (red), CVA-24 (green), EV-C95 (yellow), EV-C96 (orange) and EV-C99 (blue) strains and the prototype strains of other EV-C types. The strains sequenced in this study are indicated with black triangles. The tree was constructed using the Neighbour-Joining method and the Tamura-Nei substitution model. The bootstrap support values were calculated for 1000 replicates. The bootstrap support values >70 are shown. The inset represents the same tree with EV-C subgroups A to C identified."
