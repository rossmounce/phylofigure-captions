"pone.0062799.g006.png","Phylogeny of prolyl aminopeptidases.Propyl aminopeptidase consensus sequences are coloured red (Contigs C1103â€“C1106). The clade containing contig C1104 and two Streptomyces species is shown in yellow. The Streptomyces reference sequences from MEROPS S33 family are shown in green and family holotypes in blue. MEROPS id is indicated for each sequence. The phylogeny was inferred using the maximum likelihood method. Numbers refer to bootstrap support values higher than 75%."
