"pone.0094052.g004.png","The maximum-likelihood phylogeny of GH28 proteins.Eighty four GH28 protein sequences from eight coleopteran species are included. Their species abbreviations are found in Table S5. Labels for the coleopteran species belonging to the superfamily Curculionoidea are olive-colored and all other coleopteran sequences colored in black belong to the superfamily Chrysomeloidea. D. v. virgifera sequences are shown in red. Other sequences include: plant bugs (Lygus hesperus and Lygus lineolaris), representative fungi (chosen from 651 sequences, cyan), representative bacteria (chosen from 42 sequences, brown), and representative plants (chosen from 491 sequences, green). Bacterial sequences were used as outgroups. The numbers at internal branches show the bootstrap support values (%) for the maximum-likelihood and neighbor-joining phylogenies in this order. Supporting values are shown only when higher than 60%. Blue-colored branches indicate the species-specific gene duplications (based on currently available sequences) within a cluster supported by higher than 70% of bootstrap values. The scale bar represents the number of amino acid substitutions per site."
