"pone.0058451.g006.png","Highly simplified pterosaur phylogeny ? topology based on that recovered by Unwin [57] ? to show phylogenetic content of clade names used in the text.Caelidracones, Breviquartossa and Lophocratia are all node-based clades named by Unwin [57]. Novialoidea is a node-based clade named by Kellner [56]; it is essentially identical in content and definition to Unwin?s Longchognatha [57]. Pterodactyloidea was defined by Unwin [57] as the node-based Pteranodon longiceps+Quetzalcoatlus northropi clade but by Kellner [56] as the Pterodactylus antiquus+Quetzalcoatlus northropi clade. Neither definition is satisfactory since neither ?captures? all taxa in all topologies. Pterosaur silhouettes provided by Mark Witton."
