Illustration of the invasion of pH1N1 in the Indian Ocean (I.O) using an Euclidean drawing and a three-dimensional depiction.Phylogenetic tree derived from concatenated sequences of genomic segments HA (partial) and NA (complete ORF). Bayesian analyses were used to fix tree topologies. Branches are colored by global clade, as defined by Nelson et al. [5]. Posterior Probabilities are represented in bold (PP>0.80). Major clades were compressed in the classical (2D) tree for clarity. “Clade I.O” refers to all sequences of Clade RUN (n = 28) as well as Mauritian and Tanzanian sequences that were found to co-cluster (n = 6). Distinct strains of Seychellois, Malagasy and Tanzanian origin clustered within the compressed clade 7 (n = 8). 3D global representation, generated in Google Earth, depicts the phylogeny of all sequences derived from the Indian Ocean region.
