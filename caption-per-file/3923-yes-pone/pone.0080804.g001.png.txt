"pone.0080804.g001.png","Phylogenetic tree of mcrA gene clone (phylotype) sequences retrieved from hyporheic river sediment.The clones come from upper sediment layer (0-25 cm depth) are described as „P“, clones come from deeper sediment layer (25-50 cm depth) are described as „H“. The numbers in parenthesis indicate the number of clones. The phylogenetic tree is rooted with Methanopyrus kandleri."
