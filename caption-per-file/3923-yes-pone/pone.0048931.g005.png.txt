Current status and proposed evolutionary history of Kissr family.This representation is based on the phylogenetic and synteny analyses. The names of the main phyla are given on the corresponding branches. The names of the current representative species of each phylum are given at the end of the final branches, together with the symbol of the Kissr gene they possess. This hypothesis assumes the presence of the four Kissr paralogs in the osteichthyan lineage resulting from the two rounds of vertebrate whole genome duplication. Multiple subsequent Kissr gene loss events are indicated in the actinopterygian and sarcopterygian lineages."
