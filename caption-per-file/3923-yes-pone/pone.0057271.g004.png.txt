"pone.0057271.g004.png","The neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree of the 136 amino acid sequences from the Microviridae Phage_F domain (pfam02305).The virome sequences from the Ogasawara (OG), Mariana (MA), and Shimokita (SH) libraries are highlighted in blue, red, and green, respectively. The numbers in parentheses indicate the DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank accession numbers for the sequences. Only bootstrap values of >50% are indicated at the nodes of the tree. The uncultured marine sedimentary phage group corresponds with six environmental clones: A1 (accession no. ABS86616.1), A2 (accession no. ABS86617.1), A3 (accession no. ABS86618.1), A4 (accession no. ABS86619.1), B3 (accession no. ABS86620.1), and B4 (accession no. ABS86621.1). The Chlamydia phage Chp2 group corresponds with five isolates: Chp2 (accession no. NP_054647.1), Chp3 (accession no. YP_022479.1), Chp4 (accession no. YP_338238.1), CPAR39 (accession no. NP_063895.1), and phiCPG1 (accession no. NP_510872.1). The marine metagenome GOS10803 group corresponds with two environmental clones: GOS10803 (accession no. ECU79166.1) and GOS11146 (accession no. ECU78830.1). The Enterobacteria phage phiK group corresponds with two isolates: phiK (accession no. Q38041.1) and St-1 (accession no. YP_002985212.1). The Enterobacteria phage ID12 group corresponds with two isolates: ID12 (accession no. AAZ49343.1) and WA6 (accession no. AAZ49332.1). The Enterobacteria phage ID1 group corresponds with four isolates: ID1 (accession no. AAZ49068.1), NC11 (accession no. AAZ49145.1), S13 (accession no. AAG29961.1), and WA10 (accession no. AAZ49222.1)."
