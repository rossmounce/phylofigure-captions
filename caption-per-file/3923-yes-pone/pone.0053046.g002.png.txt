"pone.0053046.g002.png","Molecular phylogenetic tree inferred from both maximum likelihood and Bayesian analysis based on small subunit (SSU) rRNA gene sequences and illustrating that the genera Archerella and Amphitrema (Amphitremida) belong to Labyrinthulomycetes (Stramenopiles).Numbers at nodes indicate the bootstrap values/posterior probabilities. Only values above 50/0.50 are shown. The tree was rooted with the group of Rhizaria. The scale bar indicates 0.06% sequence divergence."
