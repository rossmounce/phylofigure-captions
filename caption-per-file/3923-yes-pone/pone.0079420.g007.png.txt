Ancestral range reconstructions from the Dispersal-Extinction-Cladogenesis analyses using a smoothed temporal calibration of the phylogeny.Rectangles indicate the stratigraphic ranges and associated uncertainty, black bars are the midpoint of these ranges, and wide bars represent the reconstructed ancestral range with the highest relative probability. Both the weighted and unweighted analysis results are shown here, because their highest relative probability results for each branch were the same. See Table S6 in File S1 for full results."
