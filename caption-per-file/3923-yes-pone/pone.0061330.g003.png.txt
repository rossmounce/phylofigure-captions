Distance neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree of nearly full-length anammox bacterial and environmental 16S rRNA gene sequences.The tree branch distances represent nucleotide substitution rate and scale bar represents expected number of changes per homologous position. A. pyrophilus 16S rRNA gene sequence was used as outgroup. Bootstrap values (100 resamplings) are shown near the corresponding nodes. Sequences shown in red form a monophyletic cluster and putatively define the new anammox bacterium candidate species, ?Ca. Scalindua pacifica?."
