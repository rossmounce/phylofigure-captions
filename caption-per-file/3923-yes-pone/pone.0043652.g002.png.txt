Unrooted maximum likelihood trees of partial nuclear LSU rDNA sequences of the Chroomonas clade and of the genus Cryptomonas.For both, phylogenetic tree construction and for computing distances, the same data sets with unalignable positions being pruned have been used. Evolutionary models: GTR+I+; support values: maximum likelihood/posterior probabilities, support of 100%/1.0 as bold lines; scale bar  =  expected substitutions per site. A – The Chroomonas clade included three different genera. In rooted phylogenies, the genus Chroomonas was paraphyletic with the genus Hemiselmis being nested within Chroomonas [56]. Only the genus Hemiselmis has been subject to a previous revision using an integrated taxonomy approach, thus, assignment of Hemiselmis species corresponded to tree topology [50]. New sequences labeled in bold face, sequences used for blast queries in green (see text and Table 5). 45 taxa, 920 positions. B – Partial LSU rDNA phylogeny of the genus Cryptomonas. Species designations according to previous revisions. Turquoise branches: intraspecific distances in distance classes 4 and 5; red branches: interspecific distances in class 2, green branches: interspecific distances in class 3 (see Fig. 4 and text). 64 taxa, 975 positions; new sequences in bold face, taxon label in green: sequence has been used for blast searches (see text)."
