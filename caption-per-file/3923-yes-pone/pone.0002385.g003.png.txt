A phylogenetic tree of an OR gene subgroup called family 7.The tree was constructed by the neighbor-joining method [29], based on the Poisson correction distance [30] matrices. OTUs written using red fonts indicate opossum ORs, blue fonts indicate dog ORs and green fonts indicate mouse ORs. Five human ORs belonging to other subgroups were used as outgroups. Bootstrap values were obtained by 1000 resamplings, and the values >60% are shown."
