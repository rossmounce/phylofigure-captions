Complete mtDNA phylogenetic tree of haplogroup B4'B5. This schematic tree is based on phylogenetic tree presented in Figure S1. Time estimates (in kya) shown for mtDNA subclusters are based on the coding region substitutions [11], coding region synonymous substitutions [19] and complete genome substitutions [19]. The size of each circle is proportional to the number of individuals sharing the corresponding haplotype, with the smallest size corresponding to one individual. Geographical origin is indicated by different colors: northern Asian – in blue, central Asian – in pink, eastern Asian – in red, Indian – in grey, European – in white, Mainland southeastern Asian - in orange, Island southeastern Asian – in yellow, Oceania – in green, and Native American – in purple."
