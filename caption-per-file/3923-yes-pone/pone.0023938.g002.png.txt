Host phylogeny with partial COI gene sequences. Sequences obtained in this study are highlighted (bold lettering). The Stolidobranchia species Botryllus schlosseri was used as an outgroup taxa. Labels on terminal nodes of reference sequences indicate the ascidian species and GenBank accession number or code in the Barcode of Life database. Labels on terminal nodes of sequences from this study include species name and sample code as in Table 1 (underlined: SC: Sweeting's Cay; LSS: Little San Salvador; WPC: West Plana Cay, and EPC: East Plana Cay). Bars and labels highlight the two clades of interest (I and II). Samples corresponding to Lissoclinum aff. fragile and L. fragile are further highlighted with a grey bar (IIA and IIB, respectively). Tree topology was obtained from neighbor-joining (NJ) analysis. Individual bootstrap values from NJ, maximum parsimony (MP) and maximum likelihood (ML) analyses and posterior probabilities (PP) from Bayesian inference are located in the upper-left box and correspond to circle numbers on tree nodes. Solid lines indicate bootstrap support greater than 50% from at least 2 of the 4 phylogenetic criteria, and dashed lines indicate weakly supported branches. The Didemnum vexillum cluster includes GenBank sequences: EU419439, -57, EU742661, -68, -69, -75. Scale bar represents 0.05 substitutions per site."
