"pone.0012725.g003.png","A comparison of LRR-receptors in stramenopiles.A Species tree of stramenopiles showing the number of LRR-receptor (LR) and LRR-receptor kinase (LRK) encoding genes in each genome. Broad phylogenetic groups are indicated by coloured bars (BA  =  Brown algae). The tree is schematic and based on Burki et al., [35]. B Phylogenetic tree showing LRR-receptor kinases in oomycetes. Bootstrap support scores of 50 or above shown for each branch. Protein IDs (from database sources listed in Table S1) are shown for each taxon."
