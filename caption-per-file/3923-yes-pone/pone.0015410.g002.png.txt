Sequence alignment, phylogeny, and sequence homology of insect members of the ApoLP-III family. (A) Sequence alignment of ApoLp-III sequences from Anopheles gambiae (Ag), Culex quinquefasciatus (Cq), Aedes albopictus (Aa), Spodoptera litura (Sl), Galleria mellonella (Gm), Manduca sexta (Ms), Bombyx mori (Bm), and Hyphantria cunea (Hc). Blue box () indicates highly conserved region; red arrows () denote insertions in the sequence of mosquito members of the gene family. (B) Phylogenetic tree based on sequence alignment of the deduced amino acid sequence of members of the ApoLp-III family from different insect species. Mosquito sequences are indicated in blue and those from moths in red. (C) Sequence identity among ApoLp-IIIs from insects. The blue triangle () indicates identities among mosquitoes and the red triangle () among moths. Notice the low level of sequence conservation between mosquitoes and moths (white area)."
