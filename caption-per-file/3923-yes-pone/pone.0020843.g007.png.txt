For these species sequences for nematode coxI and 12S rDNA (phylogeny on the left) and bacterial 16S rDNA (phylogeny on the right) were available. Dotted lines have been added to emphasize major discrepancies between filarial and Wolbachia trees. For further details, see paragraph 7 in the Results section."
