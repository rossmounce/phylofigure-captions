Maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree of the Arid clade of the genus Hemidactylus.Individuals of one species are collapsed into one terminal branch. Black dots on the nodes and on the terminal lineages indicate ML bootstrap values ≥70 and BI posterior probabilities ≥0.95. Species are coloured according to their geographic origin marked on the inset map where the sampling is also depicted. Colours and abbreviations in the nodes indicate reconstruction of ancestral distribution. The probability of the ancestral area reconstruction of the node marked with * is: Afr 19%, Afr/Arb 33.3%, Afr/Arb/Lev 19%, Afr/Arb/Irn 19%, Afr/Arb/Lev/Irn 9.5%; of the node **: Arb 80.5%, Afr/Arb 19.5%; of the node ***: Afr/Arb 33.3%, Afr/Soc 33.3%, Afr/Arb/Soc 33.3%; for all other nodes 100% for the area depicted. Undescribed species are labelled in accordance with previous works [7.23]."
