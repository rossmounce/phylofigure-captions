"pone.0022099.g003.png","Predicted OGDs. In the main figure the total predicted OGDs for all 40 gene families (as visualised using the iTOL web server [45]) project onto the tree constructed using the combined phylogenetic information from all 40 gene families. The colours of the arrows represent the statistical certainty of the transfer, from yellow (0.65) to red (1.00). The Eukaryotes are marked in reds, the Archaea are in greens and the Bacteria in Blues. The minor figures represent I) the total OGDs predicted for all the Ribosomal proteins (26 gene families) and II) the total OGDs predicted for all the non-Ribosomal proteins (14 gene families)."
