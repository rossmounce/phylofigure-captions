Comparative genomic analysis of B. asteroides PRL2011 with other fully sequenced bifidobacterial genomes, as well as Gardnella vaginalis.Panel a displays a Venn diagram of homologs shared between sequenced bifidobacterial-Gardnella genomes. Panel b shows the percentage of amino acid identity of the top-scoring self-matches for protein-coding genes in the analysed bacteria using the predicted proteome of B. asteroides PRL2011 as a reference. For each bacterium, the deduced protein-coding regions for each gene were compared with those derived from the B. asteroides PRL2011 genome. Panel c depicts a phylogenetic supertree based on the sequences of Bifidobacterium-Gardnella core proteins. Panel d indicates the generated phylogenetic tree based on 16S rRNA gene sequences from the same set of bacteria. Three other members of the Actinobacteria phylum, N. farcinia, T. whipplei and L. xyli, were also included in the analyses depicted in panels c and d, while the trees were rooted using L. salivarius as outgroup."
