"pone.0043034.g003.png","Comparison of the phylogenetic tree topologies of double-domain OBPs.The phylogenetic trees built using the full-length Nasonia double-domain OBPs are depicted in black, and those with information of the first domain or second domain in dark blue or dark orange, respectively. A) Full-length OBPs (left) compared with the first OBP domain (right). B) Full-length OBPs compared with the second OBP domain. C) The second domain compared with the first domain. Branch support values represent Bayesian and bootstrap, respectively. Scale bars represent amino acid substitutions per site."
