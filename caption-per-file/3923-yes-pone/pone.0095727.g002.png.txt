Phylogeny of Cyc-like sequences in Ranunculaceae.The phylogeny is inferred using Bayesian and maximum likelihood analysis, rooted in order to group together all the RanaCyL1 sequences in one clade, and all the RanaCyL2 sequences in another clade. The tree topology obtained by Bayesian inference is shown. Bayesian posterior probability ≥70 and bootstrap support from maximum likelihood analysis ≥50 are given (hyphen if inferior to those thresholds). The 381-position alignment was generated from 109 RanaCyL (from 48 species including 27 Delphinieae) and five other Ranunculales Cyc-like sequences (from three species). Portions of the tree are highlighted with colors according to the subfamilies of Ranunculaceae. The species sequenced for RanaCyL belong to: pink: Ranunculoideae, green: Thalictroideae, purple: Coptidoideae, and orange: Glaucidioideae. A: Aconitum, D: Delphinium, G: Gymnaconitum, S: Staphisagria. The RanaCyL branches tested in the molecular evolution analyses are 1a and 1b in RanaCyL1, and 2a and 2b in RanaCyL2."
