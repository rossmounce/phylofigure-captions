"pone.0076630.g002.png","Comparison of Homologous FapB and FapC Repeat Regions.The phylogeny is based on the NCBI taxonomy. Bold residues represent 50% (black), 80% (blue) and 100% (red) conserved residues. Note that the conservation is highly biased by the number of sequenced strains and internal repeat units within the Fap proteins of each genus."
