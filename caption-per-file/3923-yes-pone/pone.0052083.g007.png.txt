"pone.0052083.g007.png","Molecular-clock analysis of the Alcithoe phylogeny derived from 4696bp of mtDNA sequence indicates that A. wilsonae/knoxi diverged from the A. arabica lineage approximately 8 million years ago. All nodes are recovered with a posterior support of at least 0.93 and had >90% bootstrap support under Maximum likelihood, with the exception of the A lutea/A. fissurata node (0.58). Node age estimates are given in millions of years before present. 95% confidence intervals are depicted by boxes centred on nodes. Nodes calibrated using soft priors based on fossil data are indicated with filled boxes."
