"pone.0025119.g005.png","Tree showing the position of cps3Taï within other cps3 clusters. A neighbour-joining radial tree was constructed as described in Materials and Methods using the region including ugd, wchE and galU together with the promoter region common to all samples. The optimal tree with the sum of branch length = 0.02199305 is shown. The tree is drawn to scale, with branch lengths in the same units as those of the evolutionary distances used to infer the phylogenetic tree. There were a total of 3823 positions in the final dataset."
