Schematic phylogenetic tree showing gain and loss of hybrid lethality in section Suaveolentes.The schematic phylogenetic tree including 12 Suaveolentes species used in our studies on hybrid lethality was drawn based on tree by Marks et al. [45]. Gains of Type II lethality were established in the lineage leading to N. africana and the lineage leading to Australian clade. Subsequently, gain of Type V lethality was established in the lineage leading to N. occidentalis. In the lineage leading to N. benthamiana, loss of Type II lethality was established."
