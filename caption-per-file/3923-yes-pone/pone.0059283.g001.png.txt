Genetic variation in HIV-1 vpu gene from North Indian HIV-1 infected individuals.A)The phylogenetic tree was constructed using the Neighbor Joining (NJ) method with the Kimura two-parameter distance matrix. The first letter of the reference sequence denotes the type or subtype or CRF, the second letter denotes the country from sequence sampled and the third letter denotes the accession number. Filled triangle mark the subtype B variants and filled circles mark the subtype C variants sampled from North India. The accession numbers for Indian samples (NII-PGI-IND-vpu sequences) were marked within the brackets. The main supported clades were marked with asterisk (*) along the branch represents the bootstrap support >70%. The scale bar represents the evolutionary distance of 0.1 nucleotides per position in the sequence. B) Multiple sequence alignment of primary isolates of HIV-1 Vpu collected from HIV-1 infected individuals from North India. The color coding generated by software represents difference in color for amino acid with different physiochemical properties. Identical residues are represented as dots."
