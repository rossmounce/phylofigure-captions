Phylogenetic and expression analyses of four Populus GXM genes.(A) Phylogenetic relationship of DUF579-containing proteins from Populus and Arabidopsis. The amino acid sequences of DUF579-containing proteins from Populus and Arabidopsis were aligned using ClustalW and their phylogenetic relationship was analyzed using the neighbor-joining method in MEGA5.2 [40]. Bootstrap values resulted from 1,000 replicates are shown at the nodes. (B) Quantitative PCR analysis of the expression of PtrGXM genes in developing leaves, petioles, stems without secondary growth (stem I), and stems with secondary growth (stem II) of Populus. The expression level of each gene in leaves was taken as 1. (C) Quantitative PCR analysis of the induction of expression of PtrGXM genes in the leaves of transgenic Populus plants overexpressing PtrWND2B. The control is transgenic Populus plants transformed with an empty vector. Error bars in (B) and (C) denote the se of three biological replicates."
