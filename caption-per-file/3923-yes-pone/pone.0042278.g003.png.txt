"pone.0042278.g003.png","Molecular data-based phylogenetic hypothesis for some Bryconinae.Numbers above branches are Bayesian posterior probabilities expressed in percentage, numbers below branches indicate maximum likelihood analyses bootstrap values (modified from Hilsdorf and colleagues [10]). Morphological groups proposed by Howes [45]: stars for Brycon acuminatus, circles for Brycon falcatus, squares for Brycon orbignyanus, and a triangle for Brycon alburnus. P1 and P2, heterochromatic patterns proposed by Margarido and Galetti [29]. P3 is a new pattern recorded in Henochilus wheatlandii. Bars indicate geographical distribution."
