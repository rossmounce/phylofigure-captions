Hierarchical clustering, with heat map, of the HITChip profiles of centenarians, elderly and young adults.Subjects belonging to the groups C, E, and Y are indicated by green, blue, and yellow squares, respectively. Darkness of the spot corresponds to the bacterial abundance in the sample. Pearson correlation and Ward's clustering method were used. Genus-like bacterial groups belonging to Proteobacteria (P), Bacilli (B), Clostridium cluster IV (C.IV) and XIVa (C.XIVa) are indicated. The two phylogenetic groups members of the Clostridium cluster IV located within the Clostridium cluster XIVa (bottom) are Faecalibacterium prausnitzii et rel. and Papillibacter cinnamovorans et rel."
