Phylogenetic analysis of the outbreak Valencia/2004/Es strain.A) Phylogenetic tree of the NoV RNA polymerase gene (region A in ORF1) from the outbreak (Valencia/2004/Es) and reference strains, obtained from the European Food-borne viruses database [2]. The phylogenetic tree was constructed using the UPGMA clustering method with distance calculation using the Jukes-Cantor correction for evolutionary rate by Molecular Evolutionaty Genetics Analysis (MEGA version 2.1). B) Phylogenetic tree of the outbreak (Valencia/2004/Es) capsid P2 domain (aa 279 to 405) and selected reference strains. The phylogenetic tree was constructed using the UPGMA clustering method with distance calculation using the Poisson correction for evolutionary rate by Molecular Evolutionaty Genetics Analysis (MEGA version 4.1)."
