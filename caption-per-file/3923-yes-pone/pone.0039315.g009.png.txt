The Lachnospiraceae 16S diversity observed in stool samples is greater than from known reference resources.A phylogenetic tree constructed with 16S sequences from RDP’s training set (light blue, n = 34), publicly available genomes from human isolates (green, n = 26), publicly available HMP genomes (dark blue, n = 44), and sequences from aggregate stool samples that could be classified at the genus level (dark grey, n = 63) and that remained unclassified at the genus level (light grey, n = 408)."
