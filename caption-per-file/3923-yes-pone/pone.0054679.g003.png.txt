Maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree constructed from 30 Rickettsia spp.based on the alignment of 468 bp of the gltA gene (Figure 3A) and 402 bp of the ompA gene from 33 Rickettsia samples (Figure 3B), including our samples. On these trees, we see the relationship between the Rickettsia spp. that has been previously described (black) and the Rickettsia spp. detected in our study (red)."
