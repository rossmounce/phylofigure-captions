Phylogenetic analysis of MAPKs from the SAPK2 and YSAPK subfamilies.Completed amino acid sequences from alignment plus the following sequences were used. Mm-p38 (mouse, AAA20888.1), Mm-p38b (mouse, BAA19741.1), Rn-p38 (rat, AAC71059.1), Cf-p38 (dog, AAC36131.1), Dm-p38b (D. melanogaster, AAC39032.1), Hs-ERK6 (human, CAA55984.1), Mm-SAPK3 (mouse, CAA73850.1), Dr-pSAPK3 (zebrafish, CAA75355.1), Ca-HOG1 (yeast, CAA62214.1), Cc-p38 (C. carpio, BAA11881.1 ), Sp-STY1 (yeast, CAA61537.1), Hs-p38b (human, Q15759.2), Hss-p38 (H. saltator, EFN89763.1), Aa-p38 (A. aegypti, XP_001653240.1), Mj-p38 (M. japonicus, BAK78916.1) and Pf-MAPK1 (P. falciparum, AAC47170.1). The numbers at the note indicate the occurrences of a branch point over 500 replications. The scale bar indicates the phylogenetic distances. Pf-MAPK1 was used as an outgroup protein. SAPK2: stress activated protein kinase 2. YSAPK: yeast stress activated protein kinase. Ba-p38 was indicated by a black arrow."
