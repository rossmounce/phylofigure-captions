Phylogenetic analysis of protocadherin constant exon sequences.The phylogenetic tree was generated from alignments of protein sequences of the protocadherin constant regions by Maximum likelihood method using PhyML. Bootstrap values from 100 replicates are shown beside their respective branches. The tree is unrooted. Ac, Anolis carolinensis; Cm, Callorhinchus milii; Hs, Homo sapiens; Lm, Latimeria menadoensis; Fr, Fugu rubripes."
