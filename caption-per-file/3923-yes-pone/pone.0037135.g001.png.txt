A flexible genotyping method can be used to optimize the number of genetic markers for a specific experimental approach in a given biological system.Segregating genetic markers are used to make inferences about historical processes (e.g., phylogenetic relationships, population structure) and functional mechanisms (e.g., genotype-phenotype mapping), but the optimal number of markers (fraction of the genome) needed to achieve a desired level of resolution differs based on both the experimental approach and the specific biological systemâ€“the number of genetic markers needed to recover relationships among populations or species is related to divergence among groups (e.g., more recent or more rapid events require more variable loci); the number of markers required for optimal resolution in phenotype-mapping experiments (conducted in laboratory crosses or pedigreed wild populations) is a function of the number of recombination events captured in the pedigree; the number of markers used in association mapping or selection scans in wild populations is determined by genome-wide levels of linkage disequilibrium, which is largely dictated by demographic history. Recent methods combining reduced representation library construction and next-gen sequencing (i.e., RADseq [6]) target an intermediate number of regions (shown schematically above). We expand on this approach to provide marker sets ranging from 100s to 100,000s of regions at low cost with no requirement of prior genomic data (ddRADseq; double digest RAD sequencing)."
