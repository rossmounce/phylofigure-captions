"pone.0028554.g005.png","Paleophylogeographic distribution models for three species of rattlesnake (Crotalus). A, Phylogeny and modern geographic distribution models mapped onto modern climatic conditions. The dark gray curve represents the southern extent of glaciers during the LGM. B, Composite oxygen isotope curve for the last 320 ky inset with four paleophylogeographic reconstructions at four points, two glacial and two interglacial, to illustrate the effects of climate changes and phylogeny on the distribution of suitable habitats. Phylogenetically scaled climate envelopes were projected onto isotopically scaled paleoclimate models to generate these maps. Supplemental videos show animations of the paleophylogeographic distributions through the last 320 ky for these three species (Video S1) and for the remaining species (Video S2 and S3)."
