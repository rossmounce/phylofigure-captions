Phylogenetic tree of 31 conserved genes including corresponding sequences of C. caviae, C. felis, C. psittaci, C. abortus, C. pecorum, C. pneumoniae, C. muridarum, C. trachomatis and 10-1398/6 C. ibidis isolate.The 31 conserved housekeeping genes were concatenated, and Amphora alignments used to generate a maximum likelihood phylogeny using the PhyML implementation of the WAG model of amino acid substitution. 100 bootstrap replicates were generated."
