Phylogenetic tree of P. cannabina pv. alisalensis (Pcal) and the P. syringae species complex based on core genome proteins.A phylogenetic tree was constructed based on all proteins present exactly one time in each of the Pcal genome sequences and representative P. syringae genome sequences. The Bootstrap values for all branches of the tree are 100. The genomes and their accession numbers are listed in Table S3."
