"pone.0002048.g002.png","Consensus phylogenetic tree of the mazG gene from Group 1 phage isolates and bacteria.Bacteria sequences as in Figure 1 plus the following phage sequences: Group 1 phages S-PM2, S-IO41, IO50, S-BP3, S-MM1, SBnM1, RS23, FWP, RS18, RS56, S-MM5, RS37, RS26, RS27, RS9 and RS11 and 7 phage sequences from the NCBI database; Myxococcus phage Mx8, Roseobacter phage S101, Mycobacterium phage L-5, and cyanophages S-PM2, P-SMM4, P-SMM2 and Syn9. Trees are unrooted and were generated from DNA codon alignments. Clade support values are shown at the nodes of the clades, only values below 0.95 are shown. Group 1 is shown coloured in red, phage sequences from NCBI in orange, and bacteria as in Figure 1."
