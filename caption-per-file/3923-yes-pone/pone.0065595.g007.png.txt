Phylogenetic tree of COG1058.Schematic representation of the COG1058 phylogenetic tree (full version is in Fig. S1). The stand-alone COG1058 gene and the gene fused with FAD synthetase and pncC genes are depicted as green, red and blue circles, respectively. The Shewanella oneidensis and Agrobacterium tumefaciens COG1058 proteins, experimentally characterized in this work, are marked by red stars. Thermoplasma acidophilum COG1058 protein, whose 3D structure is available, is highlighted."
