Phylogenetic dendrogram constructed from concatenated sequence of all the 11 RNA segments.Clusters and clades were assigned arbitrarily based on observation of clustering patterns, and shown on the right. In the phylogenetic tree of the concatenated sequences of G3P[8], G3P[8] strains analyzed in the present study are marked with circle, while other G3 P[8] strains with square, triangle and rhombus. Scale bars are shown below. Bootstrap values are indicated at nodes of branches."
