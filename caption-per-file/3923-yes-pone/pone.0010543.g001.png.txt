"pone.0010543.g001.png","Comparison of cyclin C coding sequences.A. The sequence of the predicted Dictyostelium protein (DDB_G0274139 at dictybase.org) was aligned against Homo sapiens (H.s.) Cyclin C and Srb11 from S. pombe (S.p.) and S. cerevisiae (S.c.). Alignment against a generic cyclin box from the NCBI conserved domain database (cd00043) is also shown. B. Cyclin protein sequences were obtained from NCBI (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) nucleotide databases and aligned using Clustal W in Bioedit [36]. A generic cyclin box sequence from the NCBI conserved domain database (cd00043) was used to define the cyclin box domain within each protein. These domains were used to construct a phylogenetic tree in Bioedit using the neighbour joining method. The tree was rooted using CycJ18 from Arabidopsis thaliana as an outgroup."
