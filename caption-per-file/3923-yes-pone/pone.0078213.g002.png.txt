The phylogenetic distribution of caudal pneumaticity in sauropods and other dinosaurs is complex.Boxes represent proximal, middle, and distal caudal vertebrae, arbitrarily defined for sauropods as caudals 1?10, 11?20, and 21 on, respectively; blue boxes indicate that pneumaticity is present in that part of the tail. Pneumaticity data for theropods come from Benson et al[15]?note that although Theropoda is collapsed to a single node in this figure, caudal pneumaticity is not primitive for the clade, but evolved independently several times in both non-avian theropods and birds [6], [15], [29]. Data from sauropods come from the sources listed in Table 1. The figure also shows the phylogenetic framework we use in this paper. The phylogenetic framework is drawn from Whitlock [44] for diplodocoids, Mannion et al[30] for basal macronarians and Xianshanosaurus, Calvo et al[96] for most titanosaurs, and Campos et al[93] for Trigonosaurus. Basal sauropodomorphs are a grade, not a clade, but they are listed together here for convenience since they all lack caudal pneumaticity."
