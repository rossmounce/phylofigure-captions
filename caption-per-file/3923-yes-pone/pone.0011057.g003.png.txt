"pone.0011057.g003.png","Distance-based neighbor joining phylogeny of influenza A(H1N1)pdm in early phase of the pandemic with particular swine influenza strains.The upper panel shows the phylogeny using NA-MP that was derived from Eurasian avian-like swine H1N1 virus. The lower panel shows the phylogeny using PB2-PB1-PA-HA-NP-NS that was derived from the triple reassortant swine H1N2/3. Bold name shows Narita/1 which was the first confirmed case in Japan. Both trees were re-rooted with swine influenza strains. The scale bar in the units of the number of base substitutions per site is drawn at the bottom of each tree."
