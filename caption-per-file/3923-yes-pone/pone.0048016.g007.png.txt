Exclusion of exon 2 from hTERT mRNA is specific to primates.A. A phylogenetic tree of TERT mRNA coding regions was created with the Jalview algorithm using percent identity neighbor joining. A genome sequence is currently unavailable for Bonobo, but is in the same genus (Pan) as chimpanzee. B. RT-PCR of TERT exons 1?3 of Monkey (Cos-7 cells), Mouse (NIH3T3), Rat (NRK), Dog (D17), Orangutan (Pongo pygmaeus) and Bonobo (Pan paniscus). An arrow indicates wild type bands and an asterisk indicates DEL[e2]. PCR reactions shown are representative of at least 2 trials."
