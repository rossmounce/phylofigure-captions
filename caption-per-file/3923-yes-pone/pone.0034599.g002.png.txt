Maximum Likelihood (ML) phylogram for the New Zealand skink lineage containing the Otago skink (Oligosoma otagense). The lineage contains five other species: O. waimatense, O. acrinasum, O. infrapunctatum, O. pikitanga, and O. taumakae. The phylogeny is based upon 1834 bp of mitochondrial DNA sequence data (ND2, ND4 & Cytochrome b). Two measures of branch support are indicated with ML bootstraps (500 replicates) on the left and Bayesian posterior probabilities on the right (only values over 50 and 0.7, respectively, are shown)."
