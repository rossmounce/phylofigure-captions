"pone.0065312.g005.png","The phylogenetic trees were constructed by using the Maximum Likelihood method based on the Kimura 2-parameter model, with the nucleotide sequences the nonstructural protein (ORF1, NS1) and the capsid protein (ORF2, VP1).The percentage of the tree in which the associated sequences clustered together is shown above the branches (only those >70% are shown). The trees are drawn to scale, with branch lengths measured in the number of substitutions per site. Evolutionary analyses were conducted in MEGA5. The analyses involved 39 sequences of vertebrate parvovirus with their GenBank accession numbers marked in the tree. PPV5 sequences characterized in the present study are in bold and marked with ???. The sequence of Mythimna loreyi densovirus (AY461507) is used as outgroup to root the tree. The asterisk indicates the new genus proposed by ICTV. (A) Tree constructed based on the nucleotide sequence of NS1. All positions containing gaps and missing data except ambiguous positions were included. There were a total of 2,690 positions in the final dataset. (B) Tree constructed based on the nucleotide sequence of VP1. All positions containing gaps and missing data except ambiguous positions were included. There were a total of 3,386 positions in the final dataset."
