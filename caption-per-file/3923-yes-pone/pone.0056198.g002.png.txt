Evolutionary relationships among dihydrofolate reductase-thymidylate synthase (DHFR-TS) from 43 Trypanosoma cruzi isolates.Three phylogenetic trees were created by neighbor-joining (NJ), minimum evolution (ME), and maximum parsimony (MP) methods from the alignment of each gene target and a consensus tree was interpreted. Numbers at the branches are bootstrap values >50% (500 replicates) for the same nodes of the NJ, ME, MP trees. Evolutionary distances were computed using the Kimura 2-parameter method [29]. The nine isolates with positions incongruent to the mitochondrial phylogenies (Fig. 3) are highlighted. *?=?reference strains. Sequences clustered in 3 clades: Clade 1 includes TcIV T. cruzi isolates from the US and reference TcIV and TcV S. America strains. T. cruzi isolates of TcI lineage from the US and reference strains clustered in Clade 2, while Clade 3 consists on TcII and TcVI S. American reference strains."
