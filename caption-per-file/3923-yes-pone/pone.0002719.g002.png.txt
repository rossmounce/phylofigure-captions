"pone.0002719.g002.png","Phylogenetic analysis of bacterial 16S rDNA detected in 39 samples from human skin.From 3,963 clones, sequences representing 11 bacterial phyla and 366 SLOTUs were observed. The numbers in parentheses indicate the number of SLOTUs in each phylum. Alignments were done with Greengenes, and misalignments were manually in MEGA 4.0 [38], evolutionary distances were calculated with the Jukes–Cantor algorithm, and phylogenetic trees were determined by the Neighbor-Joining method; with 1,000 trees generated, bootstrap confidence levels are shown at tree nodes for values ≥50%. Panel A: Phylogenetic analysis of 20 samples from 6 healthy subjects. Panel B: Phylogenetic analysis of 13 samples from the lesions of 6 patients with psoriasis."
