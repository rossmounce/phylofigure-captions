Nine phylogenies recovered by systematic analyses of Allosauroidea and outgroup taxa. Some trees have been pruned to show only those taxa incorporated into the present study. Analyses along the top two rows recover Acrocanthosaurus atokensis as a member of Carcharodontosauridae, whereas the bottom row represents those that place Acrocanthosaurus atokensis as close relative and/or sister taxon to Allosaurus."
