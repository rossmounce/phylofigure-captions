"pone.0092460.g001.png","Proposed phylogenetic tree of Chlorella species of interest.Green arrows point to branch placement of the three candidate strains examined in this study (C. vulgaris UTEX 265, C. sorokiniana UTEX 1230, and C. protothecoides UTEX 411); black arrows indicate strains with active genome projects. Asterisks denote strains found to align more closely with a species other than their original labeled speciation. The scale bar represents a 2% difference between distinct ITS region sequences."
