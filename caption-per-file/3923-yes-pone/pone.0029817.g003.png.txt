Scatter plot distinguishing cAMP and the Rhodopsin like sequences. The sequences which are plotted were tested with HMM search using 7tm_1 (PF00001) and Dicty_CAR (PF05462) HMM models downloaded from Pfam. The e-values for each Rhodopsin like sequence (Y-axis) is plotted against the e-values of cAMP like sequences (X-axis) in a logarithmic scale. The members are distinguished with colors corresponding to each group shown in the right corner. The dotted line in red shows the approximate cutoff which clearly distinguishes cAMP and Rhodopsin like sequences according to the HMM search with the HMM models. The special cases which are shown in green with accession id, received e-values very similar in HMM search against both the models, but were classified as Rhodopsin like sequences according to the HMM search. Those 8 sequences which belong to ciliates (2) and Fungi (6) were classified as cAMP like sequences with strong support from phylogeny, which is shown as an inset at the top. The posterior probability more than 90% is marked with a star (green). An approximate cutoff according to the phylogeny is shown as dotted lines (black)."
