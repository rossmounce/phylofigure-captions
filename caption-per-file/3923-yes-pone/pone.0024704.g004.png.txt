"pone.0024704.g004.png","Firmicutes phylogenies obtained using functional clustering, 16S rRNA gene sequence, or core gene sequence. Colored leaves represent taxonomic orders. Trees generated using (A) functional similarity of COGs as detailed in Figure 2, (B) 16S rRNA gene similarity, and (C) core gene sequence similarity (for excinuclease ABC subunit A, the only core gene found for Firmicutes). Note that while overall tree structure is comparable for the three methods, functional phylogeny and the excinuclease ABC subunit A core gene sequence correctly assign organize the Bacillus cereus group with other Bacillus and Geobacillus genera within the Bacillaceae."
