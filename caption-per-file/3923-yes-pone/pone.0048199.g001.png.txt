Molecular evidence for horizontal gene transfer among Domiasiat isolates.The genes encoding (A) 16S rRNA and (B) zntA/cadA/pbrA-like transporters.of uranium and heavy metal tolerant isolates obtained from subsurface soils of U-rich deposits of the Domiasiat site were subjected to neighbor-joining analysis. Respective accession numbers of gene nucleotide sequences are indicated in brackets. PIB-type ATPase positive isolates predicted to have undergone HGT are connected by dotted lines. The scale bars indicate 0.05 change per nucleotide position for the 16S rRNA gene and 0.1 change per amino acid position for PIB-type ATPase phylogeny."
