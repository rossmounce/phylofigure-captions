"pone.0018570.g006.png","A ConSurf analysis for Mtb BfrB structure. The residues in the 3D cartoon structure as well as in the primary sequence are colored by their conservation grades using the nine grade color-coding bar, with turquoise-through-maroon indicating variable-through-conserved. Yellow colored residues in the sequence panel denote regions that were assigned conservation level with low confidence due to insufficient data and hence have been excluded from the analysis. Highly conserved and variable residues are marked and depicted as sticks. Location of the conserved ferroxidase site as well as the variable 4-fold and 3-fold channels is marked with dotted oval (red), diamond (yellow) and triangle (green) respectively. The analysis was carried out using one subunit of Mtb BfrB structure and multiple sequence alignment given in figure 3. (B) A phylogenetic tree of ferritin representatives constructed by the ConSurf server."
