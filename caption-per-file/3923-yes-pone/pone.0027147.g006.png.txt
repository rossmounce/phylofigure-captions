Bivalve major morphological characters. Optimization of six major morphological characters on bivalve phylogeny as retrieved in this work. Each tree shows the parsimony reconstruction of ancestral state given the p14 topology and a matrix of morphological characters compiled following [13] and [19]; see text for more detail. A, gill grade; B, hinge; C, gill cilia; D, stomach type; E, labial palps; F, shell microstructure."
