Phylogenetic relationships between Arabidopsis MYB transcription factors and anthocyanin-related MYBs in other species.LcMYB1 clusters next to CsRudy, within the anthocyanin subgroup 6 MYBs. The subgroup numbers were previously described [12]. The tree was constructed using MEGA 5, neighboring-joining phylogeny testing, and 1,000 bootstrap replicates. The accession numbers for the genes in the other species are provided in Figure 1."
