Different phylogenetic hypothesis of Euthecosomata. A) The left topology is deduced from Rampal studies which considered two straight shell species groups: Creseidae (Creseis, Hyalocylis, Styliola) and Cavoliniidae composed of two sub families, the Cavoliniinae (Cavolinia Clio and Diacria) and the Cuvierininae (Cuvierina) B) The right topology is deduced from the works of Spoel [13], and BÃ© & Gilmer [67] which group all the straight shell species in Cavoliniidae, which is composed of three sub-families Clionae (Clio, Creseis, Hyalocylis, Styliola), Cuvierininae (Cuvierina) and Cavoliniinae (Cavolinia, Diacria). Family and sub-family taxa are indicated by symbols: diamond for Limacinidae; down triangle for Cavoliniidae; square for Creseidae; up triangle for Clionae; hexagon for Cavoliniinae; round for Cuvierininae."
