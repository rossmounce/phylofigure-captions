"pone.0022111.g002.png","HRSV subgroup A Phylogenetic Tree. 601 nucleotides of the G protein gene were amplified, sequenced, and compared to published sequences from GenBank. We have labeled the samples according to the following format: “Sample code/Country of collection/Month- Year of collection”. The number of strains with identical sequences is shown in parenthesis to the right of one representative strain. The comparison sequences are complete genome sequences from GenBank, these are presented in the following format: “Strain Number/GenBank Accession Number in Bold”. Nucleotide sequences were aligned by using Clustal X. Phylogenetic analyses were performed using the Kimura two-parameter model as a model of nucleotide substitution and using the neighbor-joining method to reconstruct phylogenetic trees (MEGA version 2.1)."
