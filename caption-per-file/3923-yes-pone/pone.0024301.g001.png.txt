Genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity among sequential S. aureus CF isolates. (A) Maximum likelihood phylogeny based on core genome point mutations for the 3 CF isolates in comparison to 5 additional CC30 isolates. MRSA252 is representative of hospital associated epidemic ST36 strains [31], BTN1260 and c101 are methicillin sensitive (MSSA) ST30 isolates from a global collection [32], 00_3031_G and 07_1973_G are a community associated MSSA and a hospital associated MRSA from Scotland, respectively (unpublished data). Scale represents substitutions per site. Growth curves in threonine-depleted CDM for (B) smaller (S) and larger (L) colony variants of ED83, (C) ED84 and (D) smaller (S) and larger (L) colony variants of ED86. Hemolytic activity on sheep erythrocytes for (E) colony variants of ED83, (F) ED84 and (G) colony variants of ED86."
