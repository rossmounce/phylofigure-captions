"pone.0038794.g003.png","Phylogenetic tree of 103 HAs from H5N1 strains.Phylogenetic trees are inferred from protein sequences by the Neighbor-Joining method and rooted using A/turkey/England/1991(red text). Estimates of the statistical significance of the phylogenies are calculated by performing 1,000 bootstrap replicates. The lengths of the horizontal line are proportional to the numbers of protein sequence differences, as indicated by the scale bars. Different clades classified by the WHO are shown as grayish-white bars. Virus with glycosylation site 158N deficiency are labeled in red, whereas glycosylation site 169N deficiency are labeled in green, and the dual deficiencies are labeled in purple. Several important mutation strains mentioned in the article are labeled in blue."
