"pone.0017932.g052.png","Phylogeny of Allosauroidea upon the inclusion of proposed taxa known from highly fragmentary specimens. Included taxa are Siamotyrannus, Lourinhanosaurus, and Australovenator. A full phylogenetic analysis of 20 terminals recovered 11 MPT's (TL  =  338 steps), the strict consensus of which is shown. This phylogeny has been cropped to show only allosauroid relationships, as the outgroup taxa were unaffected."
