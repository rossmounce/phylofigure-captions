"pone.0024430.g002.png","Phylogenetic relationships of leaf nodulated endosymbionts, related insect endosymbionts and free-living Burkholderia. Bayesian phylogenetic tree based on 16S rRNA sequences (1208 bp) with support values of Bayesian and Maximum Likelihood analysis (Bayesian posterior probabilities/Maximum Likelihood Bootstrap). Gray and yellow shading denote leaf nodulated and insect gut symbionts, respectively. Voucher information of the leaf nodulated hosts are shown in parentheses. Environmental Burkholderia strains with accession numbers are unshaded. Branches of leaf nodulated Ardisia, Pavetta, Psychotria and Sericanthe species are indicated in cyan, blue, red and green, respectively. The scale bar represents 0.5 substitutions per site."
