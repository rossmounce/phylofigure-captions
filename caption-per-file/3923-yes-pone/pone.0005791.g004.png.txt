"pone.0005791.g004.png","Phylogenetic relationships and exon/intron structure with B3 domain localization in each gene for REM family of Arabidopsis and rice.A, Unrooted Neighbor-joining tree of the entire amino acid sequences of Arabidopsis REM I and REM VI proteins. B, Unrooted Neighbor-joining tree of the entire amino acid sequences of Arabidopsis REM VII proteins. C, Unrooted Neighbor-joining tree of the entire amino acid sequences of Arabidopsis REM VIII proteins. D, Unrooted Neighbor-joining tree of entire amino acid sequences of Arabidopsis REM IX proteins. E, Unrooted Neighbor-joining tree of the entire amino acid sequences of rice REM I proteins. F, Unrooted Neighbor-joining tree of the entire amino acid sequences of rice REM III proteins. G, Unrooted Neighbor-joining tree of the entire amino acid sequences of rice REM V proteins. H, Unrooted Neighbor-joining tree of entire amino acid sequences of rice REM VIII proteins. I, Unrooted Neighbor-joining tree of entire amino acid sequences of rice REM XIII proteins. Bootstrap values from 1,000 replicates were used to assess the robustness of the trees. Bootstrap values >40 are shown. The scale bar represents a 0.1 estimated amino acid substitution per residue. The phylogenetic tree and exon/intron structure with domain localization of each B3 domain type are shown. Each colored box represent one B3 type domain, as indicate in the figure. The different colours of REM B3 domains per protein were based on different class found in phylogenetic analysis of REM B3 domains showed in Figure 2B, 2C, 2D. MIPS Arabidopsis thaliana and Orysa sativa database was used for exon/intron structure information [87]. As it is not possible to construct phylogenetic tree with less than 4 genes, specific classes with few members of classes were not showed in this figure such as AtREM X and OsREM XII."
