"pone.0064754.g002.png","Relationships of all Calotes versicolor individuals inferred from mtDNA sequence data using Bayesian phylogenetic analysis.The 50% majority-rule consensus tree shows the 118 unique haplotypes of C. versicolor. Numbers outside parentheses represent population codes following Table 1, whereas values within parentheses indicate the number of sampled individuals exhibiting that haplotype. Branch lengths are in units of time. Posterior probabilities above 0.9 are shown next to nodes. Haplotypes with yellow rectangles in lineage B represent the individuals mainly collected from Wuzhi Mountain, whereas haplotypes with blue rectangles in lineage A represent the individuals collected from the remaining part of Hainan Island and the adjacent mainland."
