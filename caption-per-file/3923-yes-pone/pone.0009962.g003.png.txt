Phylogenetic analysis of genes of different IncP1 plasmids.The TraI (A), TrbE (B), TraG (C) and TrfA (D) proteins of the neisserial conjugative plasmids and of representative members of different IncP1 plasmid subfamilies (α, RP4; β, pADP-1; γ, QKH54; δ, pEST4011 and ε, pKJK5) representative for different regions of the conjugative plasmids were used to create phylogenetic trees of the IncP1 plasmid family. (For details see materials and methods)."
