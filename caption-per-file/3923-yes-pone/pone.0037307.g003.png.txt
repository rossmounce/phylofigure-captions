"pone.0037307.g003.png","Maximum-likelihood (ML) phylogenetic analyses of homing endonuclease (HE) sequences.A. Unrooted ML phylogeny inferred from the LAGLIDADG_2 alignment containing 183 amino acid positions. Thirty HEs belonging to LAGLIDADGE_2 superfamily were subjected to the ML and Bayesian methods. The HEs hosted in cob introns are shown in dark blue. The details of the homing positions of the HE-hosting cob introns (phase and codon) are given on the right side of the tree. Codon numbers are based on the Saccharomyces cerevisiae cob gene (GenBank accession number NC_001224). Only ML bootstrap values equal to or greater than 50% are shown. The resultant tree inferred from Bayesian analysis was essentially identical to that from the ML analysis (data not shown). The branches supported by Bayesian posterior probabilities (BPPs) equal to or greater than 0.95 were highlighted by thick lines. The GenBank accession numbers of the HE sequences used in this tree are given in brackets. B. Unrooted ML phylogeny inferred from the LAGLIDADG_1 alignment containing 191 amino acid positions. Twenty five HEs belonging to LAGLIDADGE_1 superfamily were subjected to the ML and Bayesian methods. The HEs hosted in cox1 introns are shown in dark red. The details of the homing positions of the HE-hosting cox1 introns (phase and codon) are given on the right side of the tree. Codon numbers are based on the S. cerevisiae cox1 gene (GenBank accession number NC_001224). We are unsure the precise position of the intron identified in the Flammulina velutipues cox1 gene, as only HE sequence has been deposited in the GenBank database (labeled with a question mark). Other details are same as described in A."
