"pone.0070021.g001.png","The single CK1 homolog in O. tauri is diurnally expressed.A rooted phylogenetic tree has been generated from a sequence alignment of the CK1 isoforms in animal species Drosophila melanogaster, human (or mouse), the fungus Neurospora crassa, the moss Physcomitrellapatens, the plant Arabidopsis thaliana, and the green alga Ostreococcustauri. A single CK1 homolog was identified in O. tauri, that was identified from publicly available microarray data as diurnally regulated (insert, top right). The next-closest CK1-like protein from O. tauri (Ot02g06100) was used as the out-group."
