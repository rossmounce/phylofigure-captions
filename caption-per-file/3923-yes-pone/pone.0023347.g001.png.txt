Maximum clade credibility trees of the HIV-1 CRF07_BC sequences. Ancestral geographic states were reconstructed using Bayesian phylogeographic inference framework implemented in the BEAST v1.5.4 package. The tree branches are colored according to their respective geographical locations. The purple solid nodes on the trees represent the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of CRF07_BC. (A) The maximum clade credibility (MCC) tree reconstructed based on the merged gag region (HXB2 793-1211 nt and 1462-2061 nt) of subtype C origin. (B) The MCC tree reconstructed based on the gag-pol region (HXB2 2102-2601 nt) of subtype B' origin. (C) The MCC tree reconstructed based on the env region (HXB2 7095-7328 nt) of subtype C origin."
