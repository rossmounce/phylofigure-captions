Neighbour-joining tree of all clones isolated from 10 H. parallela natural populations that affiliated to Clostridia.After construction, the tree was edited using the Interactive Tree of Life website (iTOL) [77]. The 16S rRNA gene sequence of Thermotoga maritime (AJ401021) was selected as an outgroup. Branches in red are clones obtained from other scarab larvae in previous studies. For clarity, clones were grouped into OTUs, with only 1 representative clone from each OTU included in the phylogenetic tree, and the last 4 numbers of their GenBANK accession numbers (JF964265â€“JF964858) were also included. Bar charts represent the relative number of clones obtained from each natural population. Bar in the center of the circle represents 0.01 substitutions per site. The abbreviations of the bacterial species were used are as follows: R. gauvreauii, Ruminococcus gauvreauii (EF529620); C. jejuense, Clostridium jejuense (AY494606); E. brachy, Eubacterium brachy (U13038); D. auripigmenti, Desulfosporosinus auripigmenti (AJ493051); O. valericigenes, Oscillibacter valericigenes (AP012044). C. hongkongensis, Catabacter hongkongensis(AB671763); C. asparagiforme, Clostridium. asparagiforme (ACCJ01000522); E. fissicatena, Eubacterium fissicatena (FR749937)."
