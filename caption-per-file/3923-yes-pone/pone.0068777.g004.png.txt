"pone.0068777.g004.png","Neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree of the deduced amino acid sequences from the complete enterovirus polyprotein.Enteroviruses representing the bovine enterovirus (BEV) in species EV-E and EV-F, porcine enterovirus (PEV)/Enterovirus G, and human enterovirus (HEV)/Enterovirus A?D groups are included and species and serotypes are indicated. The amino acid sequences were aligned with the Clustal W program, and bootstrap confidence values were determined by 1000 replications. The scale bar represents the number of amino acid substitutions per site."
