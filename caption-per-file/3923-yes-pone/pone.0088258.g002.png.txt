Comparative phylogenetic analysis of pre-suppression and low-level viremia (RT amino acids 65?175).Multiple sequence alignments were performed using 454-RT amplicon 1 pre-suppression 454 consensus sequences and SGA LLV sequences. There were a total of 333 nucleotide positions in the alignment encoding RT amino acids 65 to 175 (region A). The evolutionary history was inferred using the Neighbor-Joining method [75]. The percentage of replicate trees in which the associated taxa clustered together in the bootstrap test (1000 replicates) are shown next to the branches [78]. Only values greater than 40 have been shown. The tree is drawn to scale, with branch lengths in the same units as those of the evolutionary distances used to infer the phylogenetic tree. The evolutionary distances were computed using the Tamura-Nei method [76] and are in the units of the number of base substitutions per site. All positions containing gaps and missing data were eliminated. All phylograms were rooted on the consequence sequence of the RT-SHIV inoculum. Evolutionary analyses were conducted in MEGA5 [73]. The number of reads at each node were binned based upon the percentage of 454 sequence reads containing the indicated sequence at each time point. The binning scale is shown by progressively sized open circles. The week post infection (PI) from which pre-suppression sequences were derived is distinguished by different colors. All LLV sequences were obtained following maximal viral load suppression and are grouped together (black circles). The asterisk denoting the Mmu 38606 week 48 LLV sequence indicates that this sequence was more divergent than the maximal level of divergence in the pre-suppression profile (0.012 vs 0.006 mutations/site)."
