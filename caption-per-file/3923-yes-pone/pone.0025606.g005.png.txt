"pone.0025606.g005.png","Evidence for antigen selection of VH gene segments in molecular clones from memory B cells. A Distribution of replacement (R) and silent (S) mutations in each framework region (FR) and complementarity-determining region (CDR), by clinical group. Statistical significance by ANOVA is indicated. B Percentage of VH gene segments with evidence of antigen selection, according to Lossos et al. [45]. Values are mean (SD) of the per-subject average (32 clones per subject). C Representative phylogenetic trees from one healthy donor (HD), one patient who spontaneously resolved an HCV infection (SR), and one patient with chronically evolving HCV infection (CE). The pattern of branching and clustering of sequences in the SR tree is evidence of clonal evolution. D Length of CDR3 peptide loops deduced from VH gene nucleotide sequences of memory B cells, by clinical group. Values are mean (SD) of the average value per subject. ANOVA p = 0.034; Newman-Keuls post test: HD vs. SR, p = 0.0.017; HD vs. CE, p = 1.0; SR vs. CE, p = 0.042. E Representative CDR3 length distribution profiles determined by spectratyping on CDR3 PCR products reveal evidence of clonal selection in SR."
