Molecular timescale (in millions of years) for the phylogenetic tree based on exons 3â€“4 of alpha and beta genes from marsupials (in gray) and placental mammals (in black).The Aime-DRB2 was included in the tree because of its critical position in the VISTA plot and the fact that its coding regions were relatively intact. The DMA and DMB genes were used as outgroups in constructing trees (data not shown). Triangles and rectangles represent gene clusters and lost genes, respectively; dashed and dotted lines represent the marsupial-placental and intra-Boreoeutheria divergences, respectively."
