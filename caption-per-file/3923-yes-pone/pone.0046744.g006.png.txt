"pone.0046744.g006.png","Phylogenetic analysis (Left) and exon-intron structures (Right) of B. distachyon MAPKs (a) and MAPKKs (b).The gene names of each gene cluster or supercluster originated from tandem or segmental duplication event were indicated with the same color in the phylogenetic tree except the black color. Only coding exons, represented by blue or yellow boxes, were drawn to scale. The black solid lines connecting two exons represented introns. Exons with different structures among the two family genes in the same subgroups were marked in yellow. Numbers above the exons or below the introns of each gene structure represented the size of exon and intron, respectively."
