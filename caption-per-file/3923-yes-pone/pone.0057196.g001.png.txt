"pone.0057196.g001.png","The maximum parsimony tree of Mg complex isolates inferred from combined sequences.Labels on the phylogeny are, from left to right: Strain No., host, and the phylogenetic group or species. Sequences used in a previous study [30] were integrated as controls (gray characters). Samples showing inconsistency in haplotype-host origin are indicated in red. The single most parsimonious tree was inferred from 1,563 bp of combined sequence of actin, beta-tubulin, and calmodulin genes including 460 parsimony-informative characters. Bootstrap values, based on 500 replicates, are indicated above the branches. The tree length was 885 steps. The consistency index (CI) and the retention index (RI) were 0.911 and 0.986, respectively."
