"pone.0075985.g005.png","Evolutionary relationship and gene structure analysis of the ZmPATs in Zea mays.The amino acid sequences of ZmPATs were aligned with Clustal X, and the phylogenetic tree was constructed using the neighbour-joining method in the MEGA 5.0 software program. Each node is represented by a number that indicates the bootstrap value. The scale bar represents 0.1 substitutions per sequence position (left). The right side illustrates the exon-intron organisation of the corresponding ZmPATs genes. The exons and introns are represented by the green boxes and black lines, respectively. The scale bar represents 1 kb (right)."
