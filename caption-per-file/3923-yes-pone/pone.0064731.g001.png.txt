A phylogenetic split-network showing the relationship between Southampton 6C strains and other strains with whole-genome data from the public database.To generate the split-network, single nucleotide variants in concatenated multiple alignments of S. pneumoniae core genome coding sequences were input to a Neighbour-Net analysis in SplitsTree. Strains sequenced in this study are coloured in green. The serotype of each strain is shown in parenthesis."
