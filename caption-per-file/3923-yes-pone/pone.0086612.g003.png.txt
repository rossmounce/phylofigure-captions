"pone.0086612.g003.png","ML phylogenies of Cnidaria based on ribosomal molecular markers 18S (upper left), 28S (upper right) and 16S datasets (lower center).Major cnidarian lineages are in cladograms and phylograms for Medusuzoa clades (Hydrozoa, Scyphozoa, Cubozoa, Staurozoa) and Anthozoa (Hexacorallia, Hexacorallia, with special emphasis with Ceriantharia (green). Divergent results in the 18S phylogeny (considering the major clades) are shown in 16S (no Ctenophora sequences in analysis) and 28S trees (jellyfish icon for Medusozoa clades, polyp icon for Anthozoa clades). Supports values are aBAYES and aLRT (parametric, upper branch) together with BS and SH-like (non parametric, lower branch) in clockwise fashion. Each dataset was aligned in MAFFT and phylogeny estimated in RAxML; support values were calculated in RAxML (BS) and PhyML (aBAYES, aLRT and SH-like; see Table S2 for details in datamatrices, software and parameters)."
