"pone.0009109.g002.png","Phylogenetic analysis of the complete 16S rDNA sequences of γ-proteobacteria.Only the 110 strains compared for their genomes were listed. Yellow (coliforms) and orange (soil Pseudomonas) colors indicate bacteria living in warmer environments. Blue colors indicate γ-proteobacteria living in colder marine/aquatic environments. Two 42°C -tolerant Shewanella are indicated by orange triangles. The dark blue colors indicate bacteria adapted to deep cold sea and polar environment. The phylogenetic tree was generated based on pair-wise nucleotide distance of Kimura two-parameter using the neighbour-joining method (complete deletion, 3000 bootstrap value) included in the MEGA3 software package [68]."
