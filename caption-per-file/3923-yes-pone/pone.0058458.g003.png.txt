"pone.0058458.g003.png","Phylogenetic analysis of FeCH sequences.The ML phylogeny inferred from FeCH amino acid sequences from 71 bacteria and 65 eukaryotes. Numerical values at the nodes represent MLBPs and BPPs. Only MLBPs greater than 60% are shown. The majority of the FeCH homologs sampled from eukaryotes (colored in red) were separated into four clades shaded in blue, green, pink, and orange. The homologs from Strongyloides venezuelensis identified in this study formed the ?orange? clade with those of other nematodes. We compared the ML tree and the alternative hypotheses for the origin of the nematode FeCH genes by pruning and regrafting the entire nematode clade (shaded in orange) to the branches marked by diamonds in the ?blue? clade."
