Phylogenetic trees generated by the maximum-likelihood (ML) method, using the GTR+I+Γ model of evolution as estimated, based on the coding regions of the full-length (S) 1,287-nucleotide S- and (L) 6,474-nucleotide L-genomic segments of NVAV.The phylogenetic position of NVA MSB95703 is shown in relationship to representative murine rodent-borne hantaviruses, including HTN 76–118 (NC_005218, NC_005222), SOO SOO-1 (AY675349, DQ056292), DOB/BGD Greece (NC_005233, NC_005235) and SEO 80–39 (NC_005236, NC_005238); arvicoline rodent-borne hantaviruses, including TUL 5302v (NC_005227, NC_005226), PUU Sotkamo (NC_005224, NC_005225) and PH PH-1 (Z49098, EF646763); a neotomine rodent-borne hantavirus, SN NMH10 (NC_005216, NC_005217); and a sigmodontine rodent-borne hantavirus, AND Chile9717869 (NC_003466, NC_003468). Also shown are TPM VRC66412 (AY526097, EU001330) from the Asian house shrew (Suncus murinus); MJN Cl05–11 (EF641804, EF641806) from the Ussuri white-toothed shrew (Crocidura lasiura); CBN CBN-3 (EF543524, EF543525) from the Chinese mole shrew (Anourosorex squamipes); ARR MSB73418 (EF650086, EF619961) from the masked shrew (Sorex cinereus); JMS MSB144475 (FJ593499, FJ593501) from the dusky shrew (Sorex monticolus); SWS mp70 (EF636024, EF636026) from the Eurasian common shrew (Sorex araneus); RPL MSB89863 (FJ790772, EF540771) from the northern short-tailed shrew (Blarina brevicauda); ASA N10 (EU929072, EU929078) from the Japanese shrew mole (Urotrichus talpoides); and OXB Ng1453 (FJ539166, FJ593497) from the American shrew mole (Neurotrichus gibbsii). GenBank accession numbers are FJ539168 and FJ593498 for the NVA full-length S and L segments, respectively. The numbers at each node are posterior node probabilities based on 30,000 trees: two replicate Markov Chain Monte Carlo runs consisting of four chains of two million generations each sampled every 100 generations with a burn-in of 5,000 (25%). The scale bar indicates nucleotide substitutions per site."
