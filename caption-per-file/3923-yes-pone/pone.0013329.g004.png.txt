"pone.0013329.g004.png","Phylogenetic tree of the NA of the 2009 pandemic influenza A(H1N1) strains from Finland.All sequences of genes included in the phylogenetic tree were 1401 nucleotides long. The horizontal lines are proportional to the number of nucleotide changes. The phylogenetic tree was constructed using the Neighbor-Joining method with Mega software version 4. In addition to the strain identification the geographic location where the infection likely occurred and the week when the sample was collected are indicated. The country, and the state (in cases where the disease was contracted in USA) where the infection has been contracted is indicated. In addition, the following abbreviations are used: SF – Southern Finland, EF – Eastern Finland, WF – Western Finland, NF – Northern Finland (including Oulu and Lapland districts). Viruses identified in patients suffering from a severe infection (including fatal infections) are marked in blue."
