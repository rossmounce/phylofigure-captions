Phylogenic clustering of E1-1374∧63nt variant sequences with other currently available published HPV16 whole genome sequences.The whole genome sequences of four E1-1374∧63nt variant samples (ZG01-118, ZG01-258, ZG03-145 and ZG05-249) were aligned with the available published whole genome sequences and the phylogenetic tree was created using MEGA5. The leftmost part shows the percent nucleotide sequence differences calculated using MEGA5 to determine variant lineages according to a proposed taxonomic classification [18], [19]. The top part of the figure was adapted from the transcription map of HPV16 available at http://pave.niaid.nih.gov/. Sequences at respective positions are shaded in different shades of blue according to the distance from the E1-1374∧63nt variant. Dots ""."" indicate no change from referent sequence while ""∼"" and ""INS"" indicate insertions. The European (or A) lineage appears to be subdivided into 3 sublineages A1–A3, based on the tree topology and sequence percent difference similarly as previously described [17]–[19]. The A1 lineage contains the reference HPV16 genome, the A2 lineage contains the E-G350 related variants, including the E1-1374∧63nt variant samples and the E-12 variant described in Bhattacharjee et al. [15]. The A3 sublineage contains only the E-G131 sample, which exhibits the most difference from other sequences. Variant ""E-12"" was previously shown to be more prevalent in cancer samples [15], while the variation 7450 T>C was shown to be statistically more prevalent in cancer samples [49]. Positions where samples ZG01-118 and ZG01-258 differ have been sequenced for 3 additional samples and in each case only one of 5 sequenced samples has this change. Additional whole length E1 sequencing has revealed that changes at positions 1656 and 1692 were only present in 2 of 12 samples. Thus, all those changes are unlikely to be the major cause of the association of the E1-1374∧63nt E-G350 variant with low grade cervical lesions. The major difference between E1-1374∧63nt E-G350 variant and other variants are the positions 1053 and 1374, while the only differences between the E-G350 and E-C109/G350 sequenced variants are at positions 24 and 109."
