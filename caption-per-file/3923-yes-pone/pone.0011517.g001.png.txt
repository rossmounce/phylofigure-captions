Source organism and phylogenetic relationships of the new proteins.A: Pontella mimocerami illuminated and imaged under white light. Note the blue non-fluorescent coloration, which is typical of many pontellid species. B: Same specimens under blue light showing the bright green fluorescence. On panels A and B, female is on the left, male is on the right. C: Bayesian phylogeny of the protein-coding sequences of all known GFPs from copepods of the Pontellidae family, rooted with cpGFP from Chiridius poppei, a copepod from the family Aetideidae. Scale bar: 0.05 substitutions per nucleotide site. The posterior probability at each node is 1.00 except where indicated. The two new proteins are indicated by green rectangles."
