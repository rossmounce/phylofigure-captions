Phylogenetic tree of dinoflagellates inferred from rDNA.Concatenated phylogeny, inferred from 18S+5.8S+28S rDNA (2900 characters). The tree is reconstructed with Bayesian inference (MrBayes). Numbers on the internal nodes represent posterior probability and bootstrap values (>50%) for MrBayes and RAxML (ordered; MrBayes/RAxML). Black circles indicate a posterior probability value of 1.00 and bootstrap >90%. N. scintilans is represented with a dashed branch as this taxon was excluded from the inference; alternatively its most “probable” placement was determined from a parallel Bayesian analysis. * Denotes taxa sequences generated from this study. See Table S2 for a full listing of accessions used."
