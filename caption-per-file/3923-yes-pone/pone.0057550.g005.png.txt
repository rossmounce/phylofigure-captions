"pone.0057550.g005.png","Relationship between phylogeny and A) biomass and fecundity, B) temperature tolerance and tube building.In A) larger circles represent higher biomass (dry weight) and fecundity (eggs per female) on log scales. In B) temperature tolerance is measured as the reduction in average survival time in the elevated temperature treatment (25Â°C) compared to controls. Larger circles indicate a larger effect of elevated temperature (i.e., lower tolerance). Species with non-significant effect of treatment (using survival analysis) have the effect set to 0 (this is indicated by a+sign). Additional figures with both means and standard errors for each trait are available as supplementary material (Figure S1)."
