The evolutionary relationships of the envelope gene sequences of DENV-3.The phylogenetic tree was constructed by the neighbour-joining method with a Kimura 2 parameter model using MEGA 4.0 software. Bootstrap values were set for 1000 repetitions and were placed over each main node of the tree. The tree was rooted by strain of DENV-1 (AF425619).The black dots denoted endemic DENV-3 strains from Canton in 2009 and 2010. Airplane symbols denoted imported index DENV-3 strains from Canton in 2009 and 2010."
