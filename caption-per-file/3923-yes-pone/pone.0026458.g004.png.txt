Endophytic diversity results (right) plotted against the Bryopsis host phylogeny (left). The OTU diversity (1â€“7) displayed on the right summarizes the diversity results from the clone libraries and DGGE analyses. The concatenated chloroplast 16S rRNA gene - rbcL maximum likelihood tree on the left classifies the Bryopsis MX samples in two distinct species clades with 100% bootstrap support. The scale bar indicates 0.002 nucleotide changes per nucleotide position."
