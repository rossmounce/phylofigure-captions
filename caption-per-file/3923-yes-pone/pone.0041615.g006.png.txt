Rooted phylogenies for T3SS genes escV, escN, escF, and escJ. BI trees for the four T3SS genes described in Castillo et al., [12] are depicted with long branches truncated (//) and the total branch length indicated above.The subtree in the box represents BI branching on a different scale from the larger trees. Taxa are colored by presence in the clades described in Figure 3 and 5 to facilitate comparison between trees (clade I – purple, clade II – green, clade III – blue, clade IV – orange, clade V – red). Taxa enclosed by braces had identical sequences to the adjacent taxa and were therefore removed from the phylogenetic analysis. Diversity values (è) below gene names are calculated excluding the outgroup and those calculations also excluding the SESS LEE genes are in parentheses. Numerals at tree junctions are the percentage posterior probability."
