Structural comparison of class III CoA-transferase superfamily members.(A) Structure superposition of eight class III CoA-transferase superfamily members, shown in the same orientation as Figure 4B. PDB entries are 4hl6 (white), 4ed9 (dark blue), 1p5h (green) [69], 1pt7 (cyan) [24], 3ubm (orange) [25], 1?k7 (yellow) [70], 1?74 (magenta) [71], and 2g04 (pink) [72]. (B) ML phylogram of the structure-based sequence alignment (Figure S6) that corresponds to panel A. UniProt accession numbers and PDB entry codes are given for each taxon. The small boxes match ribbon colors in panel A. Nodes in this consensus tree with support in 1000 bootstrap replicates are labeled. The scale bar is in units of amino acid substitutions per site."
