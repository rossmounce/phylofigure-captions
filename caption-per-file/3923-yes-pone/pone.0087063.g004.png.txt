Genomic co-retention of LipB and LipM lipoylation genes with OADHC E2.(A) The presence of the LipB and OADHC E2 genes in sequenced Thermoproteales genomes is indicated (species lacking both are highlighted in grey). Pyrobaculum sp 1860 and Pyrobaculum oguniense have yet to be incorporated into the Pyrobaculum phylogeny and have been placed arbitrarily in the Pyrobaculum genus. (B) The presence of LipM and OADHC E2 in sequenced Halobacteriales genomes is indicated (species lacking both are highlighted in grey). Phylogenetic relationships are based on Brochier-Armanet et al.[53]; branch lengths are not drawn to scale."
