Amino acid sequence alignment and phylogenetic tree of ginger CDPK1.(A) The amino acid sequence alignment of Zingiber CDPK1 [GenBank ID: KC544003] with Datura CDPK, DmCPK1 [GenBank ID: 163658596] and Arabidopsis CDPK, AtCPK30 [GenBank ID: 30699042]. Identical amino acids are indicated by asterisks, and similar amino acids are marked with single dots and colons. Catalytic domains (Iâ€“XI), Junction domain, and EF hand loops of CaM-LD domain of ZoCDPK1 are marked. The 15 invariant amino acid residues for eukaryotic Ser/Thr protein kinase were highlighted. Protein kinase ATP-binding site is shown by broken lines. Active site is shown in red box. (B) Phylogenetic analysis of ZoCDPK1 with all Arabidopsis CDPKs in the database. The tree was constructed using NJ method of Mega4 software. The numbers on branches showed bootstrap probabilities determined for 1000 re-samplings. The database accession numbers are indicated in parantheses after CDPK gene names."
