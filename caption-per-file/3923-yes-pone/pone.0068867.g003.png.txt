Maximum-likelihood phylogenetic trees based on aligned nucleotide sequences.(A) Maximum-likelihood tree based on the Gja10 nucleotide sequences under the GTR+? nucleotide substitution model. (B) Maximum-likelihood tree based on the Rbp3 nucleotide sequences under the GTR+? nucleotide substitution model. Values on the nodes are maximum-likelihood bootstrap values/Bayesian posterior probabilities. Bat species with nonfunctional Gja10 and Rbp3 sequences are highlighted in red, respectively."
