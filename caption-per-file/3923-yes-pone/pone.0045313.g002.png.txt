Distribution of Dsr-LP, Fsr, FGltS(I/II)-α and FpoF in methanogenic archaea.The information has been presented on a 16S rRNA sequence based phylogenetic tree of methanogens for which whole genome sequences are available. Desulfurococcus fermentans was used as an outgroup. The confidence values presented at the branches of the tree were estimated from 1000 bootstrap repetitions; the scale bar underneath the tree indicates the number of base substitutions per site. (1 or 2), number of each type of sulfite reductase homolog in a methanogen. Dsr-LP: dissimilatory sulfite reductase-like proteins; Fsr, FGltS(I/II)-α, and FpoF: same as in the legend of Fig. 1. The Dsr-LP group numbers (Ia-d and IIIa-d) are according to Fig. 3. Color representation of Fsr-containing methanogens (color, characteristic); red, hyperthermophilic vent methanogen (except M. okinawensis is a thermophile); lavender, thermophile; blue, mesophile and psycrophile. Classification of FGltS according to Fig. 6 is shown in square brackets."
