"pone.0011293.g007.png","Evolution of the character “tooth shape” by performing ML analyses on our phylogenetic tree using BayesTraits.The variants of this character are coded with different colours: each circle in front of species' names is coloured according to the tooth shape determined in our study or found in literature. The ancestral characters inferred by this method at different nodes of the tree are given by coloured pies. The proportion of each colour in pies represents the proportion of likelihood for each character state. For tooth shape, the states “spatula”, “molariform” and “saw” morphotypes were not taken into account for the ML analysis (see Materials&Methods)."
