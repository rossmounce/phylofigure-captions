"pone.0003462.g003.png","Phylogenetic tree of the NA gene of HPAI H5N1 viruses.The phylogenetic tree was constructed by Maximum Likelihood using GARLI version 0.951 [34] by selecting GTR+G model from Modeltest 3.7 [37]. Posterior probabilities and bootstrap values were given above and below branches, respectively. The tree was rooted by Gs/GD/1/96. The predicted precursor viruses were shown in boxes."
