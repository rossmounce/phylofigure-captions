"pone.0056421.g002.png","Phylogenetic analysis of Populus trichocarpa (Pt) and Arabidopsis thaliana (At) SODs based on predicted amino acid sequences.The neighbor-joining tree was generated using Mega 5.05 [31]. The bootstrap method with 1000 replicates was used as a test of the phylogeny. The three groups identified include the copper/zinc SODs (triangles), manganese SODs (squares), and iron SODs (circles). Poplar and Arabidopsis sequences are marked with solid and empty symbols, respectively."
