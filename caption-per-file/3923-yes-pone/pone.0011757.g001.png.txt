Hypothesized scenarios for serpentine and non-serpentine ECM fungal communities.Serpentine (gray circle) and non-serpentine (white circle) alpha diversity (with circle size as a measure of higher species) in relation to the regional species pool (white oval), the change in species composition across soil type (beta diversity) and the phylogenetic relationships among serpentine (S) and non-serpentine (N) taxa. A–Low serpentine alpha diversity, high beta and phylobetadiversities across soil types, indicating serpentine soil is an environmental filter. The serpentine community can be phylogenetically clustered or random, depending if traits underlying specialization are conserved or not. B–Similar alpha diversity and low beta and phylobetadiversities across soil types, suggesting serpentine and non-serpentine communities are a random sample of the regional species pool and serpentine soil does not constitute an environmental filter."
