Beetle polygalacturonases (GH28) form two distinct clades, one more similar to those from bacteria and one more similar to those from fungi. A, A Bayesian inferred phylogeny is shown which compares the predicted amino acid sequences of the beetle GH28 enzymes described here with those known from bacteria, fungi, nematodes and plants. Posterior branch probabilities are shown and similar groupings were recovered using both Neighbor-joining and maximum likelihood based algorithms. B, Modelled cartoon view and C, Electrostatic map of C. maculatus Pect-1 enzyme oriented to view through the catalytic cleft. The proton donor (Asp205) is shown in white, and the catalytic nucleophile/base residues (Asp184 and Asp206) are shown in yellow. Conserved residues (Asn182, His238, Gly239 and Lys271) most likely implicated in substrate binding are shown in green, whereas the non conserved residue Tyr269 (instead of Arg) is shown in magenta. D, Modelled cartoon view and E, Electrostatic map of C. tremulae Pect-1 enzyme oriented to view through the catalytic cleft. The proton donor (Asp185) is shown in white, and the catalytic nucleophile/base residues (Asp164 and Asp186) are shown in yellow. Conserved residues (Asn162, His207, Gly208 and Lys245), most likely implicated in substrate binding, are in green, whereas the non conserved residue His269 (instead of Arg) is in magenta. The four conserved disulfide bridges are shown in cyan."
