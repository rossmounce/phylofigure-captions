Phylogenetic trees for intI1 (A) and sul1 (B) genes.Sequences obtained in this study and alleles deposited in the GenBank were used. The phylogram was obtained with the CLUSTALW application in MEGA v 5.05 program with default parameters. Alleles were indicated with either the isolated name (sequences obtained in this work) or the accession number (GenBank sequences). The source of each allele is shown by a coloured square (red is for clinical isolates, green is for environment isolates and blue is for alleles that have been identified in both clinical an environmental isolates. Asterisks indicate the most common clinical alleles of intI1 (A) and the allele of sul1 embedded in the most common 3â€²CS of clinical integrons (B). The outgroup branch has been reduced in order to appreciate better the other branches."
