"pone.0004969.g001.png","Maximum likelihood phylogram representing phylogenetic relationships of louse p-endosymbionts, common insect p-endosymbionts, and closely related taxa as determined from a BLAST search of each louse endosymbiont sequence.Numbers at nodes indicate maximum likelihood support values greater than 60. Gray lines indicate louse p-endosymbionts. The p-endosymbiont from Pedicinus badii (the louse that parasitizes Red Colobus monkeys) is shown in red demonstrating that it does not group with the Riesia p-endosymbionts. There are now at least six distinct clades of p-endosymbionts sampled from sucking lice."
