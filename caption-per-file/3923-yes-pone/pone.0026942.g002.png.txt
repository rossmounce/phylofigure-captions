"pone.0026942.g002.png","Unrooted Maximum Likelihood phylogenetic tree of the ssDNA-binding proteins. The SSB phylogeny was reconstructed using PhyML from multiple alignments that were generated using the “accurate” mode of T-coffee (Materials and Methods). Bootstrap support values are shown. Sequences of phages encoding Orf14bIL67 -like SSBs proteins are shown in red. Other colours: purple – Crenarchaea , blue – Euryarchaea, maroon – Eukaryotes, dark blue – mitochondria, black – Gram-negative bacteria, green – Gram-positive bacteria, and olive – phages."
