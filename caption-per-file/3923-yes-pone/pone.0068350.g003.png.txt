Bayesian phylogenetic tree of H.parasuis strain ZJ0906 and other closely related bacteria.Phylogenetic tree was constructed using MrBayes [17] using the random concatenation of 26 aligned core genes as the dataset and GTR+G+I as the substitution model. The chain length was set to 10,000,000 (1 sample/1000 generations) whilst the burn-in was set as 2000. Posterior probabilities are denoted at nodes."
