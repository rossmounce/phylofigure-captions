"pone.0036090.g002.png","Phylogenetic trees of the local P. viridiflava isolates.The construction of the dendrograms was based on A: BOX- and ERIC-PCR fingerprints (rep-PCR) and B: the combined gyrB, rpoD and rpoB gene sequences. The plant hosts are given next to the code number (PVXXX, see Table 1) of each isolate. The evolutionary history was inferred using the UPGMA method. The consensus tree inferred from 1500 replicates is taken to represent the evolutionary history of the isolates analyzed. Branches corresponding to partitions reproduced in less than 50% bootstrap replicates are collapsed. The percentage of replicate trees in which the associated taxa clustered together in the bootstrap test is shown next to the branches. The tree is drawn to scale, with branch lengths in the same units as those of the evolutionary distances used to infer the phylogenetic tree. The evolutionary distances were computed using the Maximum Composite Likelihood method and are in the units of the number of base substitutions per site. All positions containing gaps and missing data were eliminated. There were a total of 2222 positions in the final dataset. Evolutionary analyses were conducted in MEGA5."
