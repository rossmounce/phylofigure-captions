Gap attraction, the canceling of nearby complementary indels, can affect insertion and deletion rates in various ways depending on the phylogenetic relationship of the sequences involved.All programs are, to some extent, sensitive to situations A and B whereas phylogenetic aligners can avoid situation C. An insertion at a leaf requires gaps at all other leaves - an understandably costly alignment move when gaps are added without regard to the phylogeny, resulting in multiple penalization for each insertion. Such a penalization would cause most non-phylogenetic aligners to prefer the “Inferred alignment” in case C where there are fewer total gaps. Aligners treating indels as phylogenetic events would penalize each of the implied multiple deletions and only penalize each insertion once, thus preferring the “True alignment” in case C."
