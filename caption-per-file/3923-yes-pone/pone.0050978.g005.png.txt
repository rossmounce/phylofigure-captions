"pone.0050978.g005.png","Maximum likelihood phylogeny of Ty3 and Ty3p LTR sequences from the reference genome of S. cerevisiae.The phylogeny was created from 625 aligned nucleotide positions. Green boxes highlight long-branch clades whose positions among the short-branch, younger elements are probably phylogenetic artefacts since they found in different positions in the Bayesian analysis. Formatting of the tree is otherwise the same as in Figure 4."
