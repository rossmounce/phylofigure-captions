Phylogram depicting the phylogenetic relations between partial (380-bp) HCV NS5B sequences obtained in this study and representative sequences of HCV genotypes fromGenBank.The sequences from this study are shown in bold and grouped in their corresponding clusters. Percentage bootstrap values (>70%) are shown at the respective nodes. All 211 sequences were submitted to GenBank with the accession numbers JN642777â€“JN642987."
