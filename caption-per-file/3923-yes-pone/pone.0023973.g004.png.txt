Phylogeny of SAR11 AMT proteins. Four paralogous AMTs in HTCC1062 were placed into three functional subgroups: DmdA-like, GcvT, and an AMT of unknown function. All four AMTs were also identified in HTCC1002 and HTCC7211 genomes. This phylogenetic tree was generated using the neighbor-joining method. Bootstrap values are based on 100 iterations."
