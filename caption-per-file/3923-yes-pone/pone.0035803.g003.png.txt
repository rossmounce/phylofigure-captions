Phylogeny of Firmicutes-associated 16 S rRNA gene sequences derived from kakapo.16 S rRNA gene-based phylogenetic analysis of Firmicutes recovered from kakapo samples. Solid junctions represent >90% bootstrap support, and hollow junctions >75%. Kakapo-derived sequences are in bold. Dashed lines indicate sequence length 1200 bp in length, and short sequences were added subsequently using the Parsimony Interactive tool in ARB. Bootstrap values were calculated using maximum parsimony with 5000 resamplings. Scale bar, 10% sequence divergence."
