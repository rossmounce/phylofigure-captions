"pone.0003527.g004.png","Quantifying the difference in phylogenetic signal along the bloodstream expression site.A. Three tanglegrams relate the ESAG5 phylogeny with those of ESAG6 (close match), ESAG4 (moderate incongruence) and ESAG1 (severe incongruence). Dashed lines link corresponding expression sites in each tree. Incongruence between trees increases from left to right. B. Comparison of likelihood scores between optimal and constrained tree topologies for ESAG5. The phylogenies of six other ESAG loci (indicated by a cartoon of the expression site) were used to constrain the estimation of the ESAG5 tree; the difference in likelihood score between each of these constrained trees and the optimal ESAG5 tree is plotted along the expression site. Non-significant differences in likelihood are denoted by a dashed circle as evident when constraining the ESAG5 topology with the ESAG6 topology; however, enforcing the topologies of central loci (ESAGs 4 and 8) caused a moderate decrease in likelihood, whilst constraining with ESAGs 2, 11 or 1 caused a larger decrease."
