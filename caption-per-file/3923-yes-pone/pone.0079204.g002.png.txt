Phylogenetic origin of Hydnoraceae within photosynthetic Piperales.To compare the performance of individual marker combinations, separate analyses were run and are summarized here. The plastid rbcL and atpB genes are not available for Hydnoraceae. The phylogenetic trees are displayed at the ordinal level, but zoomed in to family level within Piperales (blue). Hydnoraceae are highlighted in red. Both Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian Inference were applied. Nodes with less than 0.85 posterior probability (PP) were collapsed, while nodes with less than 50% bootstrap support (BS) are indicated with a dash. Support values are plotted above branches (PP first, BS second). The obtained topologies are congruent at these levels, but vary in resolution within Piperales. The concatenated dataset that contains all markers (Figure 2D) provides both the best resolution and best support values. In this tree, all Piperales families are statistically supported as monophyletic (considering PP values). Nuclear ribosomal and mitochondrial markers have been calculated separately as well, but those phylogenetic hypotheses are poorly resolved (Figure S1Eâ€“F)."
