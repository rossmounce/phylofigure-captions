"pone.0067350.g003.png","Condensed tree based on the maximum likelihood phylogenetic analysis constructed on 79 chloroplast protein coding genes of 10 basal angiosperms, 35 monocotyledons and 3 dicotyledons.The tree has a -lnL of âˆ’527912.066159. Support values for ML are provided at the nodes. Gene losses in all members of the different clades are indicated with blue stars. Putative events of IR expansions/contractions in the monocots are indicated with red and green stars for IR/SSC and IR/LSC boundaries respectively. Major structural rearrangements are indicated with black stars. Numbers indicate aLRT branches support."
