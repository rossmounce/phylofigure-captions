"pone.0007462.g001.png","Occurrence of the melC and melD operons.A. Chromosomal locations. The approximate locations of melC and melD on the four sequenced Streptomyces chromosomes are marked. Filled circles, terminal proteins; gray area, approximate ‘core region’ of the chromosomes. B. Overlapping region of melD1 and melD2. The stop codon of melD1 and the initiation codon of melD2 are in bold face. C. Phylogenetic trees of MelC2 (top) and MelC1 (bottom) homologs. The sequences were aligned using ClustalX version 1.8 with the following parameters: method: accurate; matrix: Gonnet; gap open penalty: 10; gap extension penalty: 0.1. The phylogenetic trees were generated using the Neighbor-Joining method. The bootstrap values (in percentages) from 500 reiterations are shown. The capacity to produce melanin is indicated by filled circles, and the inability to produce melanin by open circles."
