Intra-patient phylogeny and TBC.Bayesian phylogenetic tree for a particular patient (# 7) from the Shankarappa [28] data set. Tree is rooted on the earliest sequence, and node labels represent posterior probabilities. Coloured tips correspond to different clusters retrieved by the TBC using a threshold of 12 (whilst black tips are singletons). X4-tropic populations are enclosed in red-boxes."
