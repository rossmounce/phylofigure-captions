Comparative phylogenetic analysis of strains under study and 22 whole genomes from the NCBI database.Tree based on all SNPs of genomes. Phylogenetic tree was constructed using the Neighbor-Joining algorithm. Evolutionary distances were calculated using p-distance method. The bootstrap test was for 1000 replicates. Branches corresponding to partitions reproduced in less than 50% bootstrap replicates are collapsed."
