Simplified phylogeny of rodents showing main taxa bearing dental drift.Relationships between the main rodent clades were defined via a molecular analysis [61], while relationships within ctenodactylids were determined according to morphological analyses [18], [19]. 1, Presence of third upper premolar. 2, Presence of fourth deciduous premolars; 3, Presence of fourth definitive premolars. 4, Molar crown height: B Brachydont, H Hypsodont, stH strongly hypsodont. 5, Presence of dental drift: sDD slight Distal Drift, sMD slight Mesial Drift, mMD moderate Mesial Drift, stMD strong Mesial Drift. Green branches represent the Ctenodactylidae; in grey: tooth lost during lifetime."
