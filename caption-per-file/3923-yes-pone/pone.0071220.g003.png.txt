Phylogenetic tree of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene from the tiger strain SB-1 and the most closely related sequences from different Helicobacter species.The alignment was performed with BioEdit using gap penalties of 10 for gap opening and 5 for gap extension and a bootstrap value of 1,000. MEGA5 was used to infer DNA relatedness using the Neighbor-Joining method. The evolutionary distances were computed using the Maximum Composite Likelihood method and are in the units of the number of base substitutions per site. The optimal tree with the sum of branch length was equal to 0.0360 for 16S rRNA. Helicobacter acinomychis and Helicobacter spp. were used as outgroups. The phylogenetic tree shows that the 16SrRNA gene of our Bengal tiger strain (accession number JN251811.1) branched together with H. acinonychis from Sumatra tiger (AM260522), thus demonstrating close relatedness among them."
