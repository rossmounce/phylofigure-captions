Unrooted phylogenetic tree of 28 trypsins inferred from their amino acid sequence alignment.Five phylogenetically-related clusters were inferred from this analysis: cluster A of shrimp and prawn trypsins (both cryophilic and mesophilic), cluster B of crayfish trypsins, cluster C of other non-crustacean Arthropoda, cluster D of cryophilic vertebrate trypsins, and cluster E of trypsins from mesophilic vertebrates. Cluster A trypsin sequences are shown to be very closely related to krill trypsins KT1 and KT4."
