"pone.0059399.g005.png","Bayesian Analysis.Bayesian analysis of the vp2 complete nucleotide sequences from one mongoose and one stone marten obtained during this study and other wild carnivore parvoviruses available in Genbank (Table S1). A phylogenetic tree was obtained with a Bayesian inference of phylogeny throughout the MrBayes v3.1.2 software, using the GTR model (nst?=?6) with gamma-shaped rate variation with a proportion of invariable sites (rates?=?invgamma). The analysis was performed with ngen?=?106, nchains?=?4 and samplefreq?=?10. The numbers included on each boot strap represent the Bayesian posterior probability."
