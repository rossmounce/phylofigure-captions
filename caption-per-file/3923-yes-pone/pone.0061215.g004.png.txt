Phylogram with the phylogenetic relationships of 16S rRNA gene sequences.The phylogenetic tree shows the bacterial strains and environmental clones most closely to the T-RFs in Figure 3. Whenever possible, closest strains were used for the calculation of the tree but when no strain was available (e.g. many species of Mollicutes could not be isolated so far) the closest clone was used. The tree was calculated by Baysian inference using sequences of 898 bp lengths and shows the affiliation between the clones and closest related sequences of NCBI. The clones of our study are bold marked. Only bootstrap values above 0.9 are given. The scale bar represents 0.1 (10%) of sequence divergence."
