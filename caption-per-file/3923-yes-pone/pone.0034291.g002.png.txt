Phylogenetic analysis of Ig domains from receptors located within the LRC of different species.Phylogenetic analysis of Ig domains from receptors located within the LRC of different species: The available Ig domains from SIGLEC, OSCAR, KIR, FcGRT, FcaR, LAIR, GpVI and NKp46 in species including human, murine, bovine, chimpanzee, orang-utan, gorilla and rhesus macaque were analyzed using phylogeny. Phylogenetic trees were constructed using the neighbour-joining bootstrap consensus method inferred from 1000 replicates, pairwise deletion and amino acid p distance. The graphs show Ig1â€“4 domains (a-d respectively). The receptor groups are labelled with LILR shown in red and PIR in blue."
