"pone.0019065.g002.png","Identification of variant XMRV in prostate cancer patients using phylogenetic analysis. A. envelope (env), B. polymerase (pol), and C. gag. Stability of the tree topology was tested using 1000 bootstrap replicates in both neighbor joining (NJ) and maximum likelihood (ML) methods. Bootstrap values >60 are shown at major nodes (NJ/ML). New sequences from the current study are boxed. Accession numbers for prototypical MLV sequences available at GenBank are XMRV VP35 = DQ241301, XMRV VP62 = DQ399707, XMRV VP42 = DQ241302, XMRV WPI-1106 = GQ497344, XMRV WPI-1178 = GC497343, XMRV PCA1–PCA17 = GU812341–GU812357, MLV DG-75 = AF221065, MLV MTCR = NC_001702, MLV AKV = J01998, MLV BM5eco = AY252102.1, Moloney MLV = J02255, Moloney neuropthogenic MLV variant ts1-92b = AF462057, Rauscher MLV = NC_001819, Friend MLV = X02794, mERV Chr 7 = AC167978, mERV Chr 7 = AC127565, mERV Chr 8 = AC127575, mERV Chr 12 = AC153658, mERV Chr 9 = AC121813, mERV Chr 4 = AL627077, mERV Chr 1 = AC083892), XMLV A2780 = FR670594, XMLV BHY = FR670595, XMLV Daudi = FR670596, XMLV EKVX = FR670597, XMLV IMR-5 = FR670598, XMLV MUTZ-1 = FR670599, XMLV S-117 = FR670600, XMLV TYK-nu = FR670601. Sequences denoted RAW are from the polytropic MLV isolated in HeLa cells used to develop the in-house WB test. Sequences coded as XMRV VP and PCA and WPI are from prostate cancer and CFS patients, respectively. Additional prostate cancer patient VP gag and pol sequences were kindly provided by Drs. Robert Silverman and Joe Derisi. Viral tropism, as determined by analysis of env sequences, is indicated by blue (xenotropic), purple (polytropic), and yellow (ecotropic) spheres."
