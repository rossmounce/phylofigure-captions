"pone.0022234.g001.png","Plastid phylogeny of bifid toadflaxes. Phylogenetic relationships of 57 samples representing 25 species and subspecies of Linaria sect. Versicolores based on the combined analysis of cpDNA regions rpl32-trnLUAG and trnK-matK. The majority-rule consensus tree obtained in the Bayesian analysis is shown. Numbers above branches are Bayesian posterior probabilities. Numbers below branches are maximum likelihood/maximum parsimony bootstrap values. A hyphen (–) indicates no bootstrap support over 50%. Populations of the same species are numbered as in Table S1. Geographic location of sect. Versicolores samples is shown in brackets. I – Iberian Peninsula; A – northern Africa; S – Sicily; G – Greece."
