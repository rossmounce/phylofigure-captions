Phylogenetic reconstruction based on two gene sequences of endohytes. ITS1–5.8S–ITS2 sequences (A) and β-tubulin gene sequences (B) of endophytes were used for phylogenetic reconstruction. The trees were constructed using a neighbour-joining distance matrix. Evolutionary distances were computed using the Maximum Composite Likelihood method. Bootstrap values (1000 tree interactions) are indicated at the nodes."
