Deeply diverging alphaproteobacterial GOS sequences in a COX1–COX2 protein tree. A systematic search for GOS sequences was performed to identify alphaproteobacterial clades that could potentially represent the closest free-living ancestor of the mitochondria. The Bayesian phylogenetic analysis of concatenated COX1–COX2 sequences encoded by GOS scaffolds revealed a deeply diverging clade of GOS sequences that are associated with the Rickettsiales (pp = 0.99). The tentative placement of the outgroup (OG) is indicated with an arrow. Phylogenies were produced using Bayesian methods with the CAT model. Numbers at nodes denote posterior-probability values."
