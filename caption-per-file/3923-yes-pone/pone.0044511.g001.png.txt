Phylogenetic trees of influenza viruses circulating in Maracay.This figure shows the phylogenetic relationship of the HA gene segment within influenza A/H1N1 (A), influenza A/H3N2 (B) and influenza B (C) viruses. Phylogenetic trees were constructed by the neighbor-joining method and bootstrap analysis to determine the best-fitting tree for the gene. For the comparison, we have included strains reported from GenBank. Only bootstrap values over 90% are shown."
