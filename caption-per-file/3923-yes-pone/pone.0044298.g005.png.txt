"pone.0044298.g005.png","The phylogenetic relations between the new SIVcpzPtt-Gab4 strain and other SIVcpz strains.A: SIVcpz-Gab4 gag. Bayesian method implemented in MrBayes, run for 500 000 generations with a 2.5% burn-in. Mixed model in MrBayes indicated rtREV model of amino acid change with gamma distribution rates across sites. Parameters examined with Tracer program with an effective sample size of 1308. B: SIVcpz-Gab4 pol-vif-AA. Bayesian method implemented in MrBayes, run for 500 000 generations with a 2.5% burn-in. Mixed model in MrBayes indicated Jones model of amino acid change with gamma distribution rates across sites. Parameters examined with Tracer program with an effective sample size of 1118. C: SIVcpz-Gab4 env-nef. Bayesian method implemented in MrBayes, run for 500 000 generations with a 2.5% burn-in. Mixed model in MrBayes indicated rtREV model of amino acid change with gamma distribution rates across sites. Parameters examined with Tracer program with an effective sample size of 936."
