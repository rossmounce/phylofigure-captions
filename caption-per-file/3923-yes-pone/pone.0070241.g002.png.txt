Maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree of Campylobacters based on small subunit ribosomal RNA (SSU rRNA) sequences.The tree is rooted with SSU rRNA sequence of Campylobacterales bacterium GD 1, a member of the common order of Campylobacterales considered as a relative close outgroup. Absolute bootstrap values of 1000 simulations are shown beside the major branches to indicate the stability of the branching. Only bootstrap values greater than 500 are shown. The scale bar represents the 0.06 nucleic acid substitutions per site."
