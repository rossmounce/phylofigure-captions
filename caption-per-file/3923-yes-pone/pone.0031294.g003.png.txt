Time-calibrated phylogeny of Sirenia. Consensus tree (length = 127; ri = 0.758; ci = 0.527). Taxa included in this study are highlighted in color, as follows: green, early Pliocene of Mexico; red, early Miocene of India; blue, late Oligocene of Florida. Open circles identify node-based clades; arcs indicate stem-based taxa. The poorly integrated group “Halitheriinae” is paraphyletic in this study."
