Phylogenetic relationship between cloned envs. Maximum-likelihood tree representing the phylogenetic relationship between 56 HIV-1 partial (1937 bp) env gene sequences from seven HIV-infected patients from the UK and 200 HIV-1 subtype B env gene sequences extracted from the LANL HIV database. The tree was reconstructed according to the GTR+I+G model of nucleotide substitution. Branch lengths are expressed as the number of nucleotide substitution per sites, with branches leading to the clones generated herein indicated in bold. Percent bootstrap support values above 90%, or of 100%, are indicated by one or two asterisks, respectively, on the corresponding branches. The envs are labelled with patient ID followed by isolation day (e.g. MM1-28, env from MM1 day 28). Clones from patient MM23 separates into two distinct clusters (marked with stars), indicating that the patient was infected with two different clade B strains."
