"pone.0063547.g001.png","Phylogenetic analysis of ITS sequences of 36 members of the Chaetothyriales.Phylogram inferred from the ML analysis with RAxML using the Gtrcat model of evolution. Taxa in bold refer to new combinations or new taxonomic treatments. The three evolutionary motifs identified in the 2D structure of ITS2 and unique for certain phylogenetic groups are mapped on the phylogram. The abbreviation (var) indicates certain motifs deviations."
