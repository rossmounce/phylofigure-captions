The neighbor-joining phylogenetic analysis of Caspase-1 protein.Phylogenetic tree of aligned amino acid sequences of caspase-1 from A. sinica and 14 other species. A neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree was constructed using MEGA4.0, based on the sequences from A. sinica (this study) and 14 other species from GenBank. The sequences and their caspase-1 accession numbers are shown in Fig. 5. A red circle (?) indicates As-caspase-1 from A. sinica."
