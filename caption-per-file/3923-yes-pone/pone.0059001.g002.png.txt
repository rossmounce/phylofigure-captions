Gene content, gain and loss in red algal plastid genomes.(A) Gain and loss of genes in the florideophyte and Bangiales plastid genomes. Losses of cyanobacterial genes (blue), and gene gains (red) are mapped onto a schematic phylogeny (see Figure 5) using maximum parsimony. Note that losses may have occurred later (independently), whereas gains may have occurred earlier (loss in early-branching lineage) than inferred under this criterion. RT/mat abbreviates a reverse transcriptase/maturase ORF and the intron-bearing gene is in squared brackets. The absence of magnesium chelatase (chl), tRNA genes (trn), and unknown conserved genes (ycf) may represent outright losses rather than transfers to the nucleus in some cases. (B) Comparison of cyanobacterial gene content in red algal plastids including Cyanidiales. Venn diagram is showing number of cyanobacterial genes shared among red algal plastid genomes, which represented by bubbles. Ppu Porphyra purpurea, Pye Pyropia yezoensis, Ctu Calliarthron tuberculosum, Ccr Chondrus crispus, Gte Gracilaria tenustipitata var. liui, Gla Grateloupia lanceola, Cya Cyanidiales (sum of genes in Cyanidium caldarium and Cyanidioschyzon merolae)."
