"pone.0058126.g002.png","Phyletic profile and molecular function of the FRD superfamily.On the left-hand side, phyletic profile for 47 species: gene copy numbers are plotted in accordance with the species phylogeny (left) and gene families: The number of NOX homologs of a species is given in red cells, FRE homologs in blue cells, and preNOX in orange ones. Some cells are merged according to the family hierarchy. The number of predicted homologs is given in the last column of the phyletic profile. On the right-hand side, gene copies are represented by lines which link the corresponding species and protein families; the thickness of these lines indicates the number of gene copies. Colored lines flag experimentally confirmed gene functions: red?=?ROS-generating NADPH oxidase activity; blue?=?metalloreductase activity. Black circles mark species that possess p22phox homologs."
