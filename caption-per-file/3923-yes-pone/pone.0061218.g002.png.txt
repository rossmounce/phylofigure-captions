"pone.0061218.g002.png","Bray-Curtis cluster of insect species based on their associated bacterial communities (all 477 bacterial phylotypes used for Bray-Curtis analysis) and Z-scores of the 96 most abundant bacterial phylotypes with lowest scores in light blue and highest scores in dark blue.Each column is a unique bacterial phylotype. Phylotypes are arranged according to taxonomic classification. Insect species are identified by a four-letter code (Table 1) with the first letter indicating the order, as follows: (C) Coleoptera, (D) Diptera, (H) Hemiptera, (I) Isoptera, (L) Lepidoptera, (N) Neuroptera, (S) Siphonoptera, and (Y) Hymenoptera."
