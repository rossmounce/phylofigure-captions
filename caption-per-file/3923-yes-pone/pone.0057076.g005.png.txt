"pone.0057076.g005.png","Summary of phylogenetic relationships between multiple coexisting R2 lineages with elements from phylogenetically related species.A) Schematic drawing of relationships as emerged from phylogenetic analyses. Dashed lines indicate relationships across the main clades (R2-A, R2-B, R2-C and R2-D). B) Mapping of R2 lineages distribution on coleopteran and notostracan phylogenies."
