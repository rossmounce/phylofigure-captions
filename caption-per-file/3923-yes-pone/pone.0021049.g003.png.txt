"pone.0021049.g003.png","16S rRNA and catA gene-based phylogenic trees. (A) Phylogenetic tree based on the analysis of nucleotide sequences of c. 1,500 bp of 16S rRNA gene from Halomonas organivorans and other degrading bacteria; (B) Phylogenetic tree based on the comparison of c. 840 bp of catA gene from Halomonas organivorans and other catA genes from related degrading bacteria. The trees are constructed using the software DNAstar Lasergene and the ClustalW method was used for the alignment. Branch lengths are proportional to the interfered phylogenetic distances."
