History of divergence and rate of molecular evolution in Strepsiptera. (A) BI phylogeny using the MIT1+2 dataset calibrated against time. Node age 95% credibility intervals are indicated over nodes. †Increased relative rate of 18S rRNA. *Increased relative rate of MIT1+2. ▴Significant Relative Cladogenesis (RCT) statistics. Arrows indicate fossil calibrated nodes. Clade abbreviations follow Figure 1. (B) History of molecular rate using MIT1+2 scaled to the tree in panel A with number of ancestral character reconstructions at corresponding nodes (dark red bars = total non-homoplastic state changes in morphology under parsimony [34], red bars = total morphological reconstructions using Bayesian ancestral reconstruction). Blue: Log number of lineages at corresponding distance from root. tMRCA = time to Most Recent Common Ancestor; K/T = Cretaceous/Tertiary boundary."
