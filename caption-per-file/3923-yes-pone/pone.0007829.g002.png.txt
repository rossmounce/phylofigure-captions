"pone.0007829.g002.png","MSA of miR-433 and miR-127 gene promoters in eight mammalian species.(a) MSA of sequences 2 kb before pre-miR-433. (b) MSA of sequences between pre-miR-433 and pre-miR-127. ClustalW was used to build the phylogenetic tree. The number following each species name represents the evolutionary distance."
