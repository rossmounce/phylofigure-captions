Phylogenetic analysis. 18S rRNA sequences from the respective Cryptosporidium isolates identified were compared phylogenetically using the MEGA 4.1 software. The phylogenetic tree obtained demonstrates the genetic diversity of the Cryptosporidium genotype II isolates identified from stool samples from Shanghai (SH1–10) and Shaoxing (SX11–16). Analysis was based on the nested-PCR of the18S rRNA locus sequence using the tree method of Neighbor Joining."
