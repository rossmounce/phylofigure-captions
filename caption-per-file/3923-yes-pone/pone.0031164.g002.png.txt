"pone.0031164.g002.png","The phylogenetic relationships of single-domain SCP/TAPS proteins (>120 amino acids in length) predicted from the transcriptomes of Clonorchis sinensis, Opisthorchis viverrini, Fasciola hepatica and F. gigantica (liver flukes) and the genomes of Schistosoma mansoni, S. japonicum and S. haematobium (blood flukes) based on Bayesian inference. Group 1 (a); group 2 (b); group 3 (c); group 4 (d). The posterior probability supporting each clade is indicated. The corresponding phylogenetic reconstructions conducted using Neighbour Joining analyses of single-domain SCP/TAPS proteins are available from the primary author upon request."
