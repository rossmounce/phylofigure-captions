Cluster A (Fig. S2) of the 16S rRNA maximum-likelihood (ML) phylogeny for Burkholderia.Similar groupings were recovered following analysis of the data using Bayesian Inference (BI). Statistical support of ? 60% for ML bootstrap (BS) and ? 0.60 BI posterior probability (PP) are indicated at the branches in the order PP/BS. Diazotrophic Burkholderia species appear in blue, nodulating isolates in red and all nodulating South African isolates in green, with those isolates from this study also appearing in bold. All strain/isolate designations are followed by the name of the legume host and country of geographic origin. Names of the indigenous legume hosts are abbreviated as in Table 1. The GenBank accession numbers for the 16S rRNA sequences are listed in Table S1. The scale bar indicates the number of nucleotide substitutions per site. There are four groups of isolates which could not be included in full (due to size constraints) the ?missing? isolates are indicated as follows: *A1? Burkholderia sp. STM3671 Mimosa pudica French Guiana, Burkholderia sp. STM6020 Mimosa pudica French Guiana; *A2 - Burkholderia sp. JPY-582 Mimosa hexandra Brazil, Burkholderia sp. Br3462 Mimosa flocculosa Brazil, Burkholderia sp. mpa4.1 Mimosa pigra Australia; *A3 - WK1.1d+WK1.1f+WK1.1g+WK1.1i+WK1.1j+WK1.1k+WK1.1m+HC1.1bh H. sophoroides and lastly *A4 - Kb13+ Kb14+ Kb16 V. oroboides, HC1.1bc H. sophoroides."
