Minimum evolutionary tree of concatenated SDSE MLST loci. The tree was constructed using concatenated sequences of 52 SDSE STs. The tree is drawn to scale, with branch lengths in the same units as those of the evolutionary distances used to infer the phylogenetic tree. Only bootstrap values greater than 80% are shown. Clonal complexes at both the SLV and DLV level, and singletons (s), as determined using eBURST, are also depicted."
