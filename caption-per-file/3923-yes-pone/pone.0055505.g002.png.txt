Sponge phylogenetic relationships.The tree topology represents a synthesis of phylogenetic reconstructions from [66], [74]?[75], showing the twelve sponge species from eight different sponge families targeted in this study. Bold: high microbial abundance (HMA) sponges; non-bold: low microbial abundance (LMA) sponges. The concept of LMA and HMA sponges does not follow a phylogenetic trend."
