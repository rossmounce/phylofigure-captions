"pone.0014105.g006.png","Phylogenic tree based on glpQ nucleotide sequences.glpQ sequences of 18 independent isolates from Israel and the West Bank belonging to genovars G1 to G4 were compared to glpQ sequences from other Borrelia species (accession numbers are given in parentheses). The isolates in each genovar are listed in Table 1. The phylogenic tree was inferred using the UPGMA method as described in Figure 2. All positions containing gaps and missing data were eliminated from the dataset (Complete deletion option). There were a total of 637 positions in the final dataset."
