"pone.0070779.g004.png","Unrooted neighbour-joining for orbivirus outer-core VP7(T13) proteins.An unrooted NJ phylogenetic tree for orbivirus VP7(T13) proteins was constructed using a p-distance algorithm and pairwise deletion parameters, as indicated in Figure 1. The CORV-MRM1 and CMPV isolates are shown in red font in amber coloured circle. Full names of virus isolates and accession numbers of T13 protein sequences used for comparative analysis are listed in Table S1 (supplementary data). ?e? and ?w? after serotype number indicate eastern and western strains, respectively."
