"pone.0051159.g002.png","Phylogeny of archaea PEPcase and inter-kingdom HGT candidates.Phylogeny of PEPcase sequences from PF14010 were reconstructed. Four bacteria sequences were included as outgroups and their branches are in grey. HGT candidates confirmed in this phylogeny are in bold letters with red branches. The bootstrap values of 100 replicates are labeled in the same manner as Figure 1. Ancient HGT events were marked with triangles. Euryarchaeota branches were drawn in yellow while Crenarchaeota branches were in green."
