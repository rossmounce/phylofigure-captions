Main putative clades detected among Mamiellophyceae (Chlorophyceae) based on 18S SSU reads (425 bp ? 114).The OTUs affiliated to Chlorophyceae were generated at 95% similarity. A profile alignment was processed using HMMalign and the phylogeny was built by FASTTREE2 with 100 bootstraps. The distribution of the OTUs among different lakes shows a main presence of clade 1 in Lake Pavin while clade 2 is mainly present in Lake Godivelle."
