"pone.0073588.g004.png","Phylogenetic trees of the type I MADS-BOX genes.For each clade, phylogenetic tree was estimated by Neighbor-joining method with Jukes and Canter’s distance using MEGA5. For convenience, sequences of A. lyrata were numbered from L1 to L20. Orthologous sequences from T. glabra and C. wallichii were used as out-groups for each clade. Imprinting status of A. thaliana are shown after gene name as follows: ♂; paternally expressed gene, ♀; maternally expressed gene. ω-ratio, dN, and dS values estimated by PAML are shown below the branches. Origin of the species is indicated as follows: Black circles and triangles; A. thaliana, empty circles and triangles; A. lyrata ssp. lyrata. Triangles represent cluster of recently duplicated genes. Copy number of the cluster is shown in the triangle. Branches with high ω-ratio (ω > 0.5) are shown as thick lines."
