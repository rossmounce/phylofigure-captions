"pone.0007815.g004.png","One example of homoplasy in the MIRU-VNTR-based phylogeny for the red strain lineage.The SNP C→G is shared by the strains T60, T38, T16, and T78 (dashed branches). These strains form a monophyletic group in the MLSA phylogeny (Figure 2). By contrast, the MIRU-VNTR-based topology splits these strains into three artificial groups, implying the same C→G change occurred three times independently."
