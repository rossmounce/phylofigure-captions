"pone.0082857.g002.png","Molecular phylogeny of the bivalve subclass Heterodonta using concatenated protein sets from complete mitochondrial genomes.The evolutionary history was inferred using the Neighbor-Joining (NJ) method [37], MrBayes, and Maximum likelihood (ML) analysis. The tree shows the topology of the ML tree and the values next to the branches indicate (ordered from left to right) Percentage support by ML tree/Posterior probability of MrBayes tree/) Percentage support by NJ tree. The tree was rooted using Crassostrea hongkongensis as an outgroup. The tree is drawn to scale, with branch lengths measured in the number of substitutions per site. Evolutionary analyses were conducted in MEGA5 [38] (NJ and ML) and with MrBayes [39]. The asterisk indicates that the Solenoida branch is associated with Tellinoidea in NJ and MrBayes analyses."
