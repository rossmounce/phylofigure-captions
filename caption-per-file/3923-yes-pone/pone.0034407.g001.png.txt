Organismal phylogeny and distribution of lineage-specific gene clusters. The organismal phylogeny is inferred from the concatenated protein alignment of 105 single-copy genes shared by all lineages (with 44,919 aligned amino acid sites), the three phylogenetic methods used (i.e., maximum likelihood, parsimony, and Bayesian) all produced the same tree topology with strong support (i.e., all internal nodes received 100% bootstrap support using the maximum likelihood method and >97% clade credibility using the Bayesian method). The branch lengthes shown in this figure is based on the maximum likelihood result. The numbers above a branch and proceeded by a ‘+’ sign indicate the number of homologous gene clusters that are uniquely present in all daughter lineages; the numbers below a branch and proceeded by a ‘−’ sign indicate the number of homologous gene clusters that are uniquely absent. For example, 52 gene clusters are shared by all four ‘Candidatus Phytoplasma’ genomes and do not contain homolog from any of the other eight genomes analyzed (i.e., represent possible gene gain events in the common ancestor of ‘Ca. Phytoplasma’ lineages); similarly, 27 gene clusters are missing from the four ‘Ca. Phytoplasma’ genomes but are present in all other eight genomes (i.e., represent possible gene loss events in the common ancestor of ‘Ca. Phytoplasma’ lineages)."
