"pone.0005615.g002.png","Geographic genetic variation in the Amphiumidae.Bayesian phylograms of the mitochondrial genes Cytb and 16 s (left) and the nuclear gene Rag1 (right). Numbers subtending the major nodes are Bayesian posterior probabilities to the left of the slash and maximum parsimony bootstrap values to the right. The three major clades, which primarily correspond to the recognized species, are indicated on the phylograms and maps to the right with colored lines: A. pholeter (blue), A. means (red), and A. tridactylum (green). Two putative “A. tridactylum” that are closely related to some A. means are highlighted on the phylogenies with green triangles."
