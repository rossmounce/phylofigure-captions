"pone.0075689.g001.png","Compressed phylogeny of CYP2 genes.Phylogeny of CYP2 amino acid sequences from chicken, zebra finch, turkey, and human. The maximum likelihood tree was created using MEGA5 software. The numbers on the branches indicate the number of times per 100 bootstrap replicates that the branch appeared in the trees, estimated by a random resampling of the data. The scale bar represents 20 substitutions per 100 residues. The triangles indicate genes in the same subfamily. The size of the triangles indicates the number of genes included in the branch. Blue triangle and red triangle indicate avian specific branch and human specific branch, respectively. The detailed phylogeny is shown in Figure S2."
