Hypothesized phylogenetic relationships and trait values for 76 plant species growing in Alberta grasslands. Symbols indicate relative values for species habitat associations (NMDS axis 1 score) and the total (), within-community (α), and among-community (β) components of leaf size variation (all values centered and scaled for visual comparison purposes). Branches are scaled proportional to estimated divergence times, with the root node (monocot – eudicot divergence) estimated at 139 million years ago."
