Phylogenetic analysis of Topo1.The amino acid sequences of Topo1 from different spices, including beet armyworm (S. exigua), fruit fly (D. melanogaster), silkworm (B. mori), nematode (C. elegans), CPT-producing plant (C. acuminate) and human (H. sapiens), were aligned with MEGA5.0 program. A phylogenic tree was constructed by the neighbor-joining method with 1,000 replicates. The genetic distance was drawn to scale and the bootstrap value illustrated above the line was marked in numbers."
