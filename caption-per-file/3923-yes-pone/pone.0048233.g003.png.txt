"pone.0048233.g003.png","Phylogenetic tree of Cambarellus genus.Phylogenetic tree of Cambarellus based on three mitochondrial and two nuclear genes. Bootstrap support from ML (above) and Posterior Probabilities from Bayesian Inference (bellow) are indicated on each node. ***Stands for 95 or more, **for 85?94 and *for 75?84 support values from ML analyses. Drawings correspond to male genital morphology, which is the base for traditional taxonomy of subgenus and species in the group. Individual 5?1 was morphologically identified as C. shufeldtii, but is considered here as C. ninae based on the phylogenetic position in tree."
