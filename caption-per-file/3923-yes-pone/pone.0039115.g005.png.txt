Phylogenetic analysis of NAD synthetase enzyme family.(A) Schematic representation of NAD synthetase phylogenetic tree (full version is in Figure S1) constructed based on synthetase domain. Defined types of NAD synthetase genes – “Fused” (type F), “Clustered” (type C), “Remote” (type R) and “None” (type N) are highlighted by red, green, cyan and magenta colors, respectively. The whole tree is partitioned by topology into clusters, which are designated as I–VII branches. (B) Schematic representation of species tree with mapping of NAD synthetase gene types (full version is in Figure S2). Genomes containing single NAD synthetase gene of F, N, C, and R types are depicted by red, green, cyan and magenta colors, respectively. Genomes that possess more than one NAD synthetase gene are divided into “multiple F”, “multiple N”, “single F – single N” and “all others” genome groups, which are highlighted by dark red, dark green, orange and yellow colors, respectively."
