Time-calibrated phylogeny of acanthomorph fishes based on the concatenated dataset of two mitochondrial and four nuclear genes, and six calibration points (B, C, G, H, I, and J). All nodes used for constraint cross-validation are labelled with letters A–J, percid and notothenioid nodes are labelled with letters V–Z. Insets indicate nodes labels within Paracanthopterygii, Labridae, Lophiiformes, and Tetraodontiformes. Node bars show 95% HPD."
