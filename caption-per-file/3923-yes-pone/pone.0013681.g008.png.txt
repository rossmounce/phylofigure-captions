Phylogenetic comparison of the C. elegans, Drosophila and human Mi-2 orthologues.The regions of the different Mi-2 proteins corresponding to residues 320 to 1076 of the CeLET-418 sequence were used to construct the phylogenetic tree. Numbers refer to bootstrap values supporting particular groupings."
