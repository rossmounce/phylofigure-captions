Maximum parsimony tree was inferred from combined mitochondrial (cytb, coxI, 16SrRNA) DNA sequences of Saga species.The mitochondrial consensus tree was inferred from 20 most parsimonious trees (length = 491). Branches corresponding to partitions reproduced in less than 50% trees were collapsed. The consistency index was 0.576, whereas the retention index was0.811. The composite index was 0.496for all sites and 0.468 for the parsimony-informative sites. There were a total of 641 positions in the final dataset, out of which 183 were parsimony informative. Numbers at each node indicate the MP bootstrap values. Vertical bars at right indicate the species. Banza unica was designated as outgroup. The MP tree showed that the phylogenetic relationship of S. pedo to S. c. gracilis is closer than that to S. c. campbelli."
