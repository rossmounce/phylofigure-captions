Bayesian phylogeny of TRPV1 illustrates that there is a single copy of this gene is conserved across different vertebrates. Bayesian phylogenetic tree of TRPV1 proteins from mammals (red) birds-reptiles (yellow) and fishes (green) was generated using MrBayes 3.2 [52]. Percentage posterior probabilities are marked at the node of the branches while mean branch length is marked in decimal on the respective branch. Putative TRPV like gene (JGI accession id e_gw1.02q.75.1) from “Ciona intestinalis” served as out-group in this phylogenetic tree."
