Phylogenetic analysis of clones and isolates belonging to Bacillales together with their closest neighbors available in RDP database.Phylogeny was inferred by Bayesian analysis of 16 S rRNA gene sequences of 69 clones from Tyrophagus putrescentiae grown on the tested diets (Tk - rearing diet, TFa -Fusarium avenaceum, TFc - F. culmorum, TFp - F. poae and TFv - F. verticillioides) and 39 selected type-strain sequences from the genera Bacillus and Staphylococcus. Branch lengths correspond to mean posterior estimates of evolutionary distances (scale bar, 0.2). Branch labels indicate the Bayesian posterior probability and for selected branches also supporting bootstrap values from maximum-likelihood and neighbor-joining analyses. The phylograms were outgrouped using the E. coli sequence U00096."
