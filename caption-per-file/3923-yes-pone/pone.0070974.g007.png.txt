This figure shows how the topology recovered for the T.dimidiata species complex based on the phylogenetic analysis of ITS-2 sequence data of Bargues et al. [18](a) compares to the one derived from the mtDNA sequence data (cytb+ND4) presented in this paper (b). Examination of this new figure shows that ITS-2 groups 1, 2, and 3 of Bargues et al. are essentially the same as our mtDNA groups I, II, and III (i.e. they include specimens collected from the same geographic areas). Branch color codes in ?b? indicate each of the four different genetic groups (plus T. hegneri) that comprise the T. dimidiata species complex. See Discussion section for more details on the few incongruities between the two topologies and on how these were interpreted and discussed."
