Ancestral state reconstruction for four important traits based on the obtained phylogenetic tree. The traits including the development of a ventral morphological keel from modified scales (absent/present and size), number of vertebrae, types of eggs laid (pelagic or viscid), and gill rakers morphological differences. The ancestral-state reconstruction was performed using MrBayes (2000000 generations)."
