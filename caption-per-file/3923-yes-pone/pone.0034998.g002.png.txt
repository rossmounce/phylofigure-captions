Bayesian inference phylogram based on (A) COI and (B) 12S rRNA sequences.Numbers at nodes represent bootstrap values of quartet puzzling, maximum likelihood, maximum parsimony, neighbour joining and posterior probability of Bayesian inference. Unsupported groupings are indicated using a ‘-’. No value is provided when an alternative placement of the clade in the phylogeny is suggested. Numbers between brackets are locality numbers corresponding to population entries in Table S1."
