Molecular phylogenetic tree of six damsel bugs.Phylogenetic analysis was based on all mitochondrial genes (excluding trnI, trnQ and trnM). The tree was rooted with two outgroup taxa (O. niger and L. lineolaris). Numbers close to the branching points are percentages of ML bootstrap support values (left) and Bayesian posterior probabilities (right)."
