"pone.0034939.g009.png","Phylogenetic relationship of 16S rDNA sequences obtained from the mucosal specimens of CD patients.The sequences were aligned with reference strains obtained from the GenBank database. Ten predominant bacterial species from the mucosal specimens were phylogenetically clustered into 3 phylum: Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes and Î³-Proteobacteria. The scale bar represents the genetic distance."
