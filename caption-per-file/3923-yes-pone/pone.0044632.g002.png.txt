Two branching methods used for assessing the quality of the selachian fossil record and corresponding diversity.A: Cladogram showing the original phylogenetic hypothesis; B: stratigraphic ranges (black boxes) with ghost lineages (stripped red boxes) added to fit the phylogenetic hypothesis using the Conventional Branching Method (CBM); C: stratigraphic ranges with taxic interrelationships using the Direct Descendence Branching Method (DDBM); D: Resulting diversity curves, black: standing diversity; dashed grey line: inferred diversity using the DDBM; grey line: inferred diversity using the CBM; grey boxes: Genuine Diversity Domain (GDD)."
