"pone.0025329.g002.png","Maximum likelihood tree showing the phylogentic relationship of the scaC-types alongside a heatmap of their relative distribution among sample sets. Bootstrap values and clade distinctions are shown on the tree branches. The heatmap is aligned to the tree and shows the actual number of observations of each scaC-type and is colored in shades from blue (n = 0) to yellow (50 percentile) to red (maximum). The scaC-types are indicated and branch tips and universal types are denoted with ‘#’. The positions of reference strain scaC's are also shown."
