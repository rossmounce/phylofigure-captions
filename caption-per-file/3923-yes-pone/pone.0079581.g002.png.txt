Trypanosomatid morphology, life cycle and phylogeny are indicative of two morphological superclasses.A. Phylogeny of 12 representative trypanosomatids inferred from the small subunit (SSU) rRNA gene sequence, rooted with the outgroup B. saltans. Values at nodes indicate bootstrap support. The apparent paraphyly of Trypanosoma is a well documented example of a long branch attraction artefact [212]. B. Morphological classes attained though the 12 trypanosomatid life cycles. a[3], b[1], c[8], d[6], e[9], f[5], g[7], h[213], i[36], j[195], k[214], l[215], m[216], n[217], o[187], p[218], r[219], s[213]. C. Life cycle type and transmission route from the insect host in the 12 trypanosomatid life cycles. Relevance of the L. tarentolae amastigote in the life cycle [220], [221] and the transmission pathway [213] are debated. D. Phylogeny of the 12 trypanosomatids inferred from the glycosomal glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gGAPDH), rooted with the outgroup B. saltans. Values at nodes indicate bootstrap support."
