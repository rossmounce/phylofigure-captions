Neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree including RDG2A and similar resistance proteins and resistance gene analog products.Numbers on the branches indicate bootstrap percentages. Prefixes indicate species origin. The A. thaliana RPM1 protein (Q39214) was used as an outgroup. Shown are the rice (Oryza sativa) disease resistance-like proteins BAF24312, BAD08984, BAD08990, EEC83970 and EEE69085, the PM3 wheat powdery mildew resistance protein, products of the S. bulbocastaneum blight resistance gene Rpi-blb1 and its paralogues Rga3-blb, and Rpi-blb1, predicted products of RGA_B149.blb, RGA_T118-tar (S. tarijense), RGA_SH10-tub (S. tuberosum) and Rpi-pta1 (S. papita), the I2 and I2C-1 proteins encoded by the tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum) I2 resistance locus to Fusarium wilt, the soybean (Glycine max) Phytophthora root rot resistance protein RPS-L-K-1, and the barley (H. vulgare) powdery mildew resistance proteins MLA1, MLA6 and MLA12."
