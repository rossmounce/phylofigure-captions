Evolution of PSD in araneoid spiders. PSD is optimized on the phylogeny of Araneoidea according to Miller [21] (topology “Kuntner et al. ((TA)(EN))”, Fig. 1 and supplemental material). Note the ambiguous optimization in the Nephilidae node and within Araneidae. Boxes indicate states of following characters: permanent sperm depletion (P), male sacrifice behavior (S), male genitalia mutilated in the course of copulation (G), extreme sexual size dimorphism (D), male accumulation (A), and male monogamy (M). The pictures in the right column show examples from all genera where PSD is present indicated by the equal diameter of deferent ducts and testes in adult male reproductive system (Tidarren argo taken from [30])."
