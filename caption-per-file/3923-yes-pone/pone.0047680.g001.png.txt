Neighbour-Joining (NJ) phylogenetic tree showing AMF sequences isolated from soil irrigated with freshwater (FW) and treated wastewater (WW) and reference sequences from GeneBank.Numbers above the branches indicate the bootstrap values (above 80%, 1000 replicates) of the NJ analysis; numbers below the branches indicate the bootstrap values of the maximum likelihood analysis. Sequences obtained in the present study are shown in bold type. Mortierella polycephala was used as out-group."
