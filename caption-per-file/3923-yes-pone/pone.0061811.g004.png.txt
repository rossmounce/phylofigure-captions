Neighbour-joining phylogenetic tree based on amino acid sequences of subunits of phenol hydroxylase and catechol 2,3- dioxygenase enzymes from metagenomic pyrosequencing data.(a) Phenol hydroxylase positive regulator, (b) Phenol hydroxylase sub. 1 and (c) Catechol 2,3-dioxygenase. All reference protein sequences used were obtained from SwissProt protein and Refseq_protein. The bootstrap values greater than 70% are listed."
