Features of the nad1 3?-end and the downstream non-coding region, mapped on the Ixodida phylogeny.(A) Ixodida Bayesian tree calculated on the nucleotide sequence of the 13 mt protein-coding genes, and gene order downstream of nad1. Bayesian tree was calculated according to the GTR+I+gamma model, using 13 partitions, and all branches have a posterior probability value equal to 1. In gene order scheme, the genes encoded by the strand opposite to that of nad1 are reported in bold. Gene abbreviations as in Figure 1. (B) Predicted overlap between nad1 and the downstream gene, and length of the non-coding region experimentally identified downstream of nad1 by transcriptional data. tRNA regions containing the nad1 complete stop codon are indicated in brackets, with the following abbreviations: DHU: DHU arm; AA: amino acid acceptor arm; AA-DHU: spacer between the AA and DHU arms. Gene abbreviations as in Figure 1."
