"pone.0058126.g004.png","Sequence conservation logos and the proposed structure of the ferric reductase domain of protein groups from the FRD superfamily.A. Transmembrane domains TM3 to TM5 - as predicted for human cytochrome b-245 heavy chain (NOX2) - are indicated by gray rectangles. The cladogram indicates the phylogenetic relationship of the analyzed homologous groups. In the conservation logos, the height of the stacks indicates sequence conservation; the width of the stacks is proportional to the fraction of amino acids, thus narrowed within gapped regions. B. Proposed structure of ferric reductase domain with conserved amino acid residues corresponding to the annotation in figure 4A."
