"pone.0012761.g002.png","Phylogenetic tree showing sequence relationships between the CC-TPR proteins from rice and Arabidopsis.Full-length protein sequences were aligned using Clustal X 2.0.10. A phylogenetic tree was then derived using the neighbor-joining method in Clustal X. The numbers indicate bootstrap values based on 1000 replicates. The ankyrin containing proteins are highlighted in red, the protein with FBD and F-box is highlighted in green, and the protein with protein kinase (STYKc) and U-box is highlighted in blue."
