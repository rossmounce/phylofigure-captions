Phylogeny of Leucocarbo chalconotus and L. onslowi shags based on 1040 bp mtDNA CR1.Branch lengths are proportional to the number of substitutions. The maximum clade credibility tree was generated in BEAST v1.7.4 using the HKY I model of nucleotide substitution. The phylogeny was rooted using the Auckland Island Shag (L. colensoi) and Campbell Island Shag (L. campbelli). For clarity, only posterior probability (PP) and bootstrap support (bold: maximum likelihood; italics: maximum parsimony; Roman: neighbour joining) values for major clades are shown (>0.60 PP). Nodes with less than 0.60 PP have been collapsed. Dark-bronze (black circle) or pied (white circle) plumage morphotype, if known, has been indicated on the phylogeny."
