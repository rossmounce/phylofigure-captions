The phylogeny of EV-C P1 region.The phylogenetic trees constructed from the P1 coding regions of EV-C strains, of which a complete genome sequence was available (GenBank search 27.2.2013). The trees were constructed using the Neighbour-Joining method and the Tamura-Nei substitution model. The bootstrap support values were calculated for 1000 replicates. The bootstrap support values >70 are shown. The strains of EV-C sub-groups A, B and C are shown in green, red and blue, respectively."
