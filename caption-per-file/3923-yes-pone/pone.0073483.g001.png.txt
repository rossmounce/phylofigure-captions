Phylogenetic trees of Prodh and P5Cdh across kingdoms.The phylogenetic trees were generated from amino acid sequences using the Neighbor-joining, minimum-evolution, and maximum-parsimony methods in the MEGA4.0 software. The sequence alignment data were bootstrapped with 1,000 resamplings. The scale bar indicates 0.02 nucleotide substitutions per position. The amino acid sequences of the Prodh and P5Cdh orthologs were downloaded from the NCBI protein database, and accession number for each protein is placed before the name of the protein. A, The tree for Prodhs; B, the tree for P5Cdhs."
