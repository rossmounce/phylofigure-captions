"pone.0021029.g001.png","Schematic phylogeny of haplogroup R0a encompassing seven complete mtDNA sequences from diabetic patients. The schematic classification of the R0a sub-clades is based on Černý et al. [42], while the R0a'b node is newly defined on the basis of the complete genome #7. Sequences #1–7 were obtained in the course of this study and are from Italian diabetic patients: sequences #1–6 (GenBank accession numbers JF717355-JF717360) are from subjects of the Marche region sample, while sequence #7 (GenBank accession number JF717361) is from a diabetic patient not included in the current study because the maternal ancestry was from a different region (Campania, Southern Italy). Three control mtDNA sequences from the literature (GenBank accession numbers HM185239, HM185241 [42] and AY738940 [20]), which clustered in the same sub-branches of the sequences obtained from the diabetic subjects, were also included in the tree. The position of the revised Cambridge Reference Sequence (rCRS) [43] – a member of haplogroup H2a2 – is indicated for reading off sequence motifs. Mutations are shown on the branches; they are transitions unless a base is explicitly indicated. The prefix @ designates reversions, while suffixes indicate transversions (to A, G, C, or T), insertions (+), gene locus (∼t, tRNA; ∼r, rRNA; nc, non coding region outside of the control region) and synonymous or non synonymous changes (s or ns). Recurrent mutations within the phylogeny are underlined."
