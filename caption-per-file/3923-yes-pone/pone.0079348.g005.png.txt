The phylogenetic hypotheses derived from using genes as characters.Individual gene tree was first estimated and used as character-state tree. Each gene was then treated as a character and a parsimony analysis was used to construct the species trees. Amino-acid and nucleotide sequences were analyzed separately. Numbers near the nodes are bootstrap values. Note the different placements of turtles and the low bootstrap values for the associated nodes."
