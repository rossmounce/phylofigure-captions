"pone.0022384.g005.png","Evolutionary relationships of C39 peptidase domain-containing ABC transporters in cyanobacteria. The phylogenetic analysis is based on C39 peptidase domain-containing ABC transporters in the seven gene cluster groups, except those with disrupted ORFs. The midpoint neighbor-joining tree was constructed by using MEGA4 [41] with Poisson correction model [43] and 50000 bootstrap replications for each branch. The tree is drawn to scale, and bootstrap values of major branches are shown. The name of each taxon is constituted by gene cluster group, accession number, and strain name of the C39 peptidase domain-containing ABC transporters. Major clades of the tree are composed of proteins distinctly from respective gene cluster groups and are named as the corresponding groups with different background colors. Independent evolutionary histories were inferred between the gene clusters in different groups. Proteins from group IV scattered among clades of III and V+VII, and are highlighted in orange. The group I protein found in clade II is shown in green."
