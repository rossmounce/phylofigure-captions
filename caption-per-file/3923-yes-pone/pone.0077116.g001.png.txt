Systematic positions of novel HPVs.Eleven novel HPVs (HPV 161-170, KC5) were nested within the Gammapapillomavirus Genus. The evolutionary history was inferred by using the Bayesian and ML methods. A Bayesian consensus tree was based on the whole length of the L1 ORFs. Numbers on branches are bootstrap support values to the clusters to their right (upper number: ML criterion, values, 50 are not shown) and Bayesian posterior probabilities (lower number, values, 0.90 are not shown). The tree is rooted with selected Mu and Nu species. The analysis involved 68 nucleotide sequences. All positions containing gaps and missing data were eliminated. There were a total of 1263 positions in the final dataset. Bar, 0.2 nucleotide substitutions per site. *: Particular types show incongruent systematic positions as inferred from E1-E2 gene phylogenies (Supplementary file)."
