Neighbor joining tree based on the alignment of 16S rRNA gene sequences (âˆ¼400 bp long) showing the relationship between archaeal phylotypes (DFT: Dominant Fuji Thaumarchaeota and DFE: Dominant Fuji Euryarchaeota) recovered from Mt. Fuji by pyrosequencing.The dominant soil thaumarchaeote DFT1 is indicated along representative archaeal isolates and clone 54d9. The tree is rooted with an AOB from bacterial phylum Proteobacteria."
