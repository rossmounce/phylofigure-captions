T-RFLP analysis of microbial communities in mouse colonic tissue and stool samples.(A) Representative T-RFLP patterns of bacterial populations in mouse stool sample (S), proximal (PC) and distal colon (DC). 16S rRNA genes were obtained from amplification of DNA template (50 ng DNA), digested by restriction enzyme Msp I and analyzed by capillary electrophoresis. Fragment size in base pairs is shown at the top and peak height is shown as relative fluorescence. (B) A representative phylogenetic tree was built up from 4 littermate mice based on T-RFLP analysis. Similarities of bacterial populations between stool sample (S), proximal colon (PC) and distal colon (DC) were compared by Bray-Curtis distance calculations. The scale bar shows the distance of similarity."
