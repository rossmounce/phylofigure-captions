Summary of the beetle derived Plant cell wall degrading enzymes found in this study considered against the phylogeny of the beetles sampled. The various PCWDEs are classified in function of the specific polysaccharide they degrade (i.e. cellulose, pectin, hemicellulose). The nomenclature recommended by CAZy was used to further classify them. GH: Glycoside hydrolase; CE: Carbohydrate esterase; PL: Polysaccharide lyase. The number of transcripts found for each enzyme family after EST assembly and manual curation is also indicated."
