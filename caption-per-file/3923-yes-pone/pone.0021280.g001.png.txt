"pone.0021280.g001.png","Neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree of Candidate Division TM7 with 255 TM7 phylotypes, where 160 are identified as being environmental, 42 as animal-associated, and 53 as human-associated, with a total of 208 unique OTUs. The bar chart above the outer ring represents the clone counts for each of the 16 phylotypes in our study. Subdivisions 1 and 2 are marked with a gray banner on the inner border of ring. Bootstrap values of major branches are indicated according to legend. An interactive version of this tree (http://www.phylotouch.com/tm7), developed with jsPhyloSVG [36], includes meta-analysis data such as distance matrices and links to sequences and publications."
