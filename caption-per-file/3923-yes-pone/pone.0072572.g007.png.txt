"pone.0072572.g007.png","Phylogenetic relationship among predicted cutinases of oomycete species.The cutinase encoding genes identified from Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis, Phytophthora spp. and Pythium spp. genomes were used for the phylogenetic analyses. A cutinase sequence from Frankia sp. EUN1f (ZP_06415970) was used as outgroup. The phylogeny was inferred using using Blosum model of evolution (300,000 generations) and displayed using the Interactive Tree of Life (iTOL) web server (http://itol.embl.de/). The same color indicates cutinase from the same genus, different shades indicate different species. Species abbreviations are as defined in Figure 1."
