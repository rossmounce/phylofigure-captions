SOXs gene phylogeny and amino acid alignment.(A) Bootstrap values next to the nodes represent the percentage of 1000 replicate trees supporting the corresponding clade. (B) The predicted SOX proteins from H. chinensis were aligned together with Xenopus (Silurana) tropicalis, Xenopus laevis, Bufo marinus, Rana chensinensis and Andrias davidianus SOX proteins using DNAman multiple alignment program."
