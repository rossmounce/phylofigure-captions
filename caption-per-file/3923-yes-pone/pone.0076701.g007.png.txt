"pone.0076701.g007.png","Phylogenetic analysis of animal VDAC and adenine nucleotide translocase (ANT) families.A. The phylogenetic tree of animal VDACs is based on the NJ analysis of entire animal sequences retrieved from GenBank. Fungi sequences were collapsed in the tree. B. The phylogenetic analysis of ANTs is based on the NJ analysis of entire animal sequences retrieved from GenBank. The ANT sequences other than animals are collapsed in the figure. The obvious gene duplication events are indicated by arrows. Levels of confidence of the nodes are only provided if support is greater than 50% by bootstrap analysis."
