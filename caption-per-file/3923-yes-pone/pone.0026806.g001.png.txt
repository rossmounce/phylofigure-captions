Phylogeny of bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequences recovered from sponges, tunicates and seawater. Terminal node labels denote the sequence source and GenBank accession number; for condensed clades (gray triangles) the total number of sequences (in parentheses), sequences from this study (abbreviations) and bootstrap support (%) for each clade are shown. Bold labels highlight individual sequences or clades containing sequences from in this study. Tree topology was constructed using maximum likelihood criteria and numbers on nodes depict bootstrap support (100 replicates; values Alphaproteobacteria and Betaproteobacteria+Gammaproteobacteria are expanded in Figure 2 and Figure 3, respectively. The full phylogeny is available as supplemental material (Figure S1). GOM = Gulf of Mexico seawater, HYM = Hymeniacidon heliophila, HTU = Haliclona tubifera, HCH = Halichondria sp. and DID = Didemnum sp."
