Neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree of the deduced amino acid sequences from the capsid gene.Enteroviruses representing the bovine enterovirus (BEV) in species EV-E and EV-F, porcine enterovirus (PEV)/Enterovirus G, and human enterovirus (HEV)/Enterovirus A?D groups are included and species and serotypes are indicated. The capsid sequences for the capped langur (JX538037) and unclassified AY24745 sequences (denoted with asterisks) are partial, so the correct placement of these sequences in these trees may change as more sequence data become available. The amino acid sequences were aligned with the Clustal W program, and bootstrap confidence values were determined by 1000 replications. The scale bar represents the number of amino acid substitutions per site."
