"pone.0086490.g004.png","Phylogenetic analysis of the ATP/citrate lyase.The phylogenetic tree was constructed for the N-terminus using amino acid sequences of ATP-grasp domain (A) and the C-terminus using amino acid sequences of the three domains, CoA binding, CoA-ligase and Citrate synthase, (B) of ACL genes. The regions of the domains were determined on the basis of Pfam database."
