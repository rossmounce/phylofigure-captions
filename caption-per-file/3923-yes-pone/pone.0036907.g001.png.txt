Phylogenetic relationships of the sampled titanosaur taxa (underlined in red) and outgroup taxa (black box) and body size evolution in Titanosauria.For the reconstruction of body size evolution, we used femur length as a proxy for body size and optimized it on the only phylogeny that includes all the taxa discussed in this study [10]. Europasaurus was inserted into this phylogeny as a basal macronarian [20]. Magyarosaurus, Lirainosaurus, and Europasaurus show autapomorphic size decrease, i.e., dwarfing. Phuwiangosaurus also has a slightly reduced body size compared to the stem line, while Ampelosaurus shows a slight phylogenetic size increase. Character optimization analysis was performed in TNT [41]."
