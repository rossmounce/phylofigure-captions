Phylogenetic relationship of the amino acid sequences encoded by the presumptive thylacine ATP6 and COX1 NuMts.All of the phylogenetic models grouped the presumptive thylacine COX1 NuMts (TcNumt) separately from both the published thylacine mtDNA genome (TcGenbank) and other marsupials including closely related species and the South American gray short-tailed opossum. However, the ATP8 and ATP6 presumptive NuMts grouped with the published thylacine homolog supported by strong bootstrap values. Trees represent the most conservative estimates of phylogeny attained from using a combination of models (see materials and methods). There were no differences in the groupings for individual genes between models."
