"pone.0063948.g003.png","Phylogenetic tree.Maximum likelihood tree of bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequences. Triangle heights are proportional to the number of sequences. Numbers adjacent to each node represent aLRT statistics (SH-like supports). Scale bar shows branch lengths (expected number of substitutions per site). See Tables 2 and 3 and the Table S1 for full strain details. Several known strains (from the NCBI database are shown in bold). The inset shows a cluster analysis based on the product type using all strains in the phylogeny."
