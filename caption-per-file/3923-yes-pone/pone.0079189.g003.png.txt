Phylogenetic and bootscanning analysis of HIV-1 unique recombinant forms (URFs) isolated from HIV-1 infected pregnant women in central Brazil.Legend: A. Phylogenetic analysis of four BF1 recombinant isolates in PR and RT genes labeled as (â€¢). A neighbor-joining tree was constructed using reference strains from B and F1 pure subtypes and CRFs BF circulating in Brazil and in other countries, retrieved from Los Alamos database. The Genbank accession numbers of the URFs BF1 identified in this study are: KC249749, KC249753, KC249756, KC249766. Genbank accession numbers of reference sequences used in the phylogenetic analysis are: Subtype B (AY173956, K03455); CRF12_BF (AF308520, AF385934); CRF17_BF (AY037281, EU581823); CRF28_BF (DQ085874, JF804809); CRF29_BF (JF804806, DQ085876); CRF38_BF (JN235962); CRF39_BF (EU735535, EU735534); CRF40_BF (EU735537, EU735539); CRF42_BF (EU170136, EU170138); CRF44_BF (AY536235, EF193891); CRF46_BF (DQ358801, AY455782); CRF47_BF (GQ372987, GU326095) and Subtype F1 (AF077336, AF005494).B. Schematic representation of the BF1 URF mosaic structures identified in this study. Comparative bootscanning analyses were performed with known CRFs BF circulating in Brazil and none of the study sequences displayed in PR/RT a recombinant profile identical to any CRF BF already described."
