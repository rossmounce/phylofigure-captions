Network and phylogeny for COI. a) Median-joining haplotype network for Styela plicata using COI results. Area of circles is proportional to the number of individuals found for each haplotype. Partitions inside the circles represent the proportion of each population within each haplotype. Small circles represent missing haplotypes. Lines between circles represent one mutational step and non-synonymous substitutions are indicated with an asterisk; b) Phylogeny of partial COI gene sequences using Bayesian inference. The congeneric species Styela gibbsii was used as an outgroup. Posterior probabilities are indicated when >0.5."
