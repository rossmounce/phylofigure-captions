Phylogenetic analysis.E1A, fiber and hexon genes, as well as whole genome sequences of HAdV, are analyzed with respect to their phylogenetic relationships. Genes from the three recent HAdV-B14p1 strains are closely related to each other and to the prototype HAdV-B14p genome. It is remarkable that HAdV-B14p1 has a high level of sequence similarity to the prototype genome after approximately 50 years. Phylogenetic analysis was performed using the software MEGA v4.0 (Molecular Genetic Analysis Software; http://www.megasoftware.net), specifically applying a maximum-composite-likelihood method that generated neighbor-joining and bootstrapped trees of phylogeny with 1,000 replicates; all other parameters were set by default."
