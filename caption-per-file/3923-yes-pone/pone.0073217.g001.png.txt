"pone.0073217.g001.png","Bayesian inference phylogenetic tree based on Hsp90 protein sequences from Fungi.Species in which multiple hsp90 genes have been detected are in dark blue. Filled diamonds denote putative species-specific duplication events, predicted by this study. Stars represent whole-genome duplications reported by previous studies. Numbers at nodes represent Posterior Probability (PP) values. Scale bar: substitutions/site."
