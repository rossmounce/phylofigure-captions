"pone.0002896.g003.png","Maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree of violaxanthin de-epoxidases and related proteins.A maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree (loglk = −13981.66253) as inferred from amino acid sequences (141 amino acid characters) of violaxanthin de-epoxidases and related proteins was computed using WAG model for amino acid substitution (selected by PROTTEST) with discrete gamma distribution in four categories. All parameters (gamma shape = 2.158; proportion of invariants = 0.000) were estimated from the dataset. Numbers above branches indicate ML/NJ bootstrap supports. ML bootstraps were computed using the above mentioned model in 300 replicates. An NJ tree was inferred using AsaturA program with cutoff value 0.906 and 1000 replicates. Black stars indicate both bootstraps over 90%. Nodes that display different NJ topology than the one obtained by ML are indicated by “dt”."
