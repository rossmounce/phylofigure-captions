Maximum Likelihood (ML) phylogenetic tree of diploid parthenogenetic Artemia and Asiatic sexual species based on COI haplotypes.Sequence evolution is based on the T92 G model. One thousand pseudoreplications of bootstrapping were used. For haplotypes from GenBank, the code for each haplotype shown corresponds to the code for the first individual in the alignment with that haplotype (see text, Table 2 and Figure 4 for the individuals included in each haplotype). Sexual species are shown in bold. Rare males are noted by rm followed by the population code as reported en GenBank."
