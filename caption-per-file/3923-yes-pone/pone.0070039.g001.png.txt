Unrooted Bayesian phylogenetic analysis of three mitochondrial genes (COI, 16s rRNA, and 12s rRNA) of A. obtectus.Branch lengths are drawn to scale; nodal support values are given as posterior probabilities in percent above the branches in cases with values higher than 70%. The scale bar corresponds to the expected number of substitutions per site. Codes are as given in Table S1 in File S1; for the remaining populations, see Alvarez et al. 2004 and 2005. Major clades have been color-coded for reference purposes."
