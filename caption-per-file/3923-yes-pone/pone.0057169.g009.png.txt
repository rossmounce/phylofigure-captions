Neighbour-joining tree of Firmicutes-like bacterial clones isolated from different instars of H. parallela.Only 1 representative clone from each OTU was included in the phylogenetic tree. Clones obtained in this study and closest relative bacterial clones that obtained previously form other scarab beetles were shown in bold. Bar charts represent the relative number of clones obtained from each larval stage. The bar represents 0.05 substitutions per site. For more information, see figure legends of Fig. 4."
