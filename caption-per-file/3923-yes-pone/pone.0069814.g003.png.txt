"pone.0069814.g003.png","Saxifraga phylogeny based on the nuclear ITS regions.Pie graphs on branches indicate relationships that are well-supported under Bayesian (upper; black >0.95, gray 0.90?0.94) and maximum likelihood (lower; black >70, gray 60?69) tree-building methods. The sections of Saxifraga are labeled. Clade T1, including both S. aspera and S. bryoides, is shaded in gray to emphasize the position relative to the main clade of sect. Trachyphyllum, Clade T2. For members of the genus Saxifraga, only the specific or subspecific epithet is used to label each taxon on the tree."
