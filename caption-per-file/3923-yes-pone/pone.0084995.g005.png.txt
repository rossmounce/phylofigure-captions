Sequence similarities between nucleoside triphosphate pyrophosphohydrolases (NTPHs) in bacteria and fungi.(A) Multiple sequence alignment of the only three fungal NTPHs in GenBank with those of two bacteria. FGSG_09100, FPSE_06770, BN850_0056610, BN851_0055940 and NECHADRAFT_93899 are sequences from Fusarium graminearum, F. pseudograminearum, F. sp. FIESC5, F. acuminatum and F. solani f. sp. pisi, respectively SPAM21_09323 and A989_00935 are sequences from Salinibacterium sp. strain PAMC21357 and Xanthomonas translucens DAR61454 respectively. (B) Phylogenetic analysis of the NTPH protein sequence found in Fusarium spp. and bacteria. The Fusarium and Xanthomonas clades are shaded with all other sequences from bacteria. Analysis was conducted at phylogeny.fr as detailed in the methods. Numbers on each branch indicate support for that branching based on approximate likelihood ratio tests."
