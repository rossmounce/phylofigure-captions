Gecko phylogeny and the evolution of adhesive toepads.Maximum likelihood tree showing phylogenetic relationships among gecko genera. Toepad traits, including the presence of adhesive toepads, toepad shape and the presence of paraphalanges, are illustrated by colored squares on the tips of the branches (squares with two colors indicate polymorphism within the clade). Rectangles at internal nodes represent ancestral presence or absence probabilities of adhesive toepads inferred using the 6-parameter binary-state speciation and extinction (BiSSE) model. Details for lettered clades are presented in Table 1. Representative images illustrate a variety of gecko toepad morphologies. Single digits from representative gecko species illustrating the morphological diversity of paraphalangeal elements (in gray with stippling) are shown on the right. Clades enclosed in gray boxes are shown in greater detail in Figures 3 and 4."
