Phylogenetic analysis of ArabidopsisWRKY genes used in this study and WRKY genes from Hordeum vulgare.Data were analyzed by the neighbor joining method. Annotations indicate the regulation of ArabidopsisWRKY genes by GI. The number above each branch-point referred to the bootstrap value (maximum is 100), which implied the reliability of existing clades in the tree. The system has performed 1000 replicates to construct the phylogram. The number in each clade represented the percentages of success for constructing the existing clade. 0.1 means 10% substitution rate between two sequences."
