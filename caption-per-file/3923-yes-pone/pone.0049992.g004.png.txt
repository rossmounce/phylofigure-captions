Analysis of the origin of the CQ92 lineage in different regions of the N gene delimited by the putative breakpoints.(A) A split tree inferred from the complete N gene sequence showing the evolutionary relationship. A networked pattern of mosaic lineage was found to be related to lineages GX4 and SH06. The Neighbor-Net tree was constructed by employing the SplitsTree4 program. (B) Phylogenetic relationships from positions 180 to 598 of CQ92 genome. (D) Phylogenetic relationship of the N gene fragment from positions 1?179 and 599?891. (D) Phylogenetic relationship of positions 892?1423. The evolutionary history of each fragment was inferred using the maximum likelihood method with the Kimura 2-parameter substitution model and Neighbor-Joining (NJ) method with the Maximum Composite Likelihood model. The percentage (>80%) of replicate ML trees in which the associated taxa clustered together in the bootstrap test (1000 replicates) is shown beside the branches. The NJ tree bootstrap values of the branch associated with recombinant strain are shown in parentheses. The tree is drawn to scale, with branch lengths shown in the same units as those of the evolutionary distances used to infer the phylogenetic tree. ?, mosaics."
