"pone.0027076.g003.png","Phylogenetic tree constructed using nearly full-length (âˆ¼1400 bp) sequences of the 16S rRNA gene of S. wadsworthensis strains from UC and controls alongside other Sutterella sequences available in GenBank. The evolutionary history was inferred using the Neighbor-Joining method. The percentage of replicate trees in which the associated taxa clustered together in the bootstrap test (1000 replicates) are shown next to the branches. The tree is drawn to scale, with branch lengths in the same units as those of the evolutionary distances used to infer the phylogenetic tree. The S. wadsworthenis isolates from IBD cases are marked in red and those from controls are marked in blue."
