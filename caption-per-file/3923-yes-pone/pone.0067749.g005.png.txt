Dendrogram constructed using DICE for systemic E.coli. (tolerance 5%)(minimum height >0.0%, minimum surface >0.0%)(0.0?100% coefficient) for XbaI PFGE. A dendrogram showing the strain diversity amongst systemic E. coli harbouring APEC VAGs constructed using BioNumerics software by unweighted pair group method with Arithmetic mean. The dendrogram also shows; phylogenetic group (P) (green ?=? D; red ?=? A; yellow ?=? B2; blue ?=? B1), isolate (I), organ and age of bird at isolation (H ?=? heart: K ?=? kidney: Li ?=? liver: Lu ?=? lung; S ?=? spleen), MLST sequence type (ST) and VAG profiles. The dendrogram shows the clustering of ST 117 and 2999 isolates (excluding 601) which by PFGE analysis are ?60% different from other isolates. Several ST 3004 were identified and these potentially show the acquisition of 2 Iron acquisition genes (irp2 and iucD) while other ST 3004 isolates have no VAGs (isolates 579 and 583)."
