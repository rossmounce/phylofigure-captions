The evasin family of metastriate ticks. The bootstrapped phylogram (1,000 iterations) was obtained from the alignment of deducted Amblyomma maculatum proteins with homologs deducted from DBEST sequences described in a previous publication [2], and the R. sanguineus evasins from GenBank. The Am. maculatum protein names start with Am- and are recognized by a red circle marker. Other name conventions are as described in the previous figures. The number at the nodes indicates the bootstrap support above 50%, and the bar at the bottom indicates 20% amino acid divergence. Clades and superclades with strong bootstrap support are indicated with Roman numerals."
