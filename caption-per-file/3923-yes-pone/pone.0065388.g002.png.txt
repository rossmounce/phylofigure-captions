Maximum likelihood tree displaying all detected OTUs from human skin, intensive care unit, and clean room environments.Symbol “man”: phylotype retrieved from human skin (the number of symbols gives the number of individuals carrying this phylotype; 5 subjects were screened with respect to the archaeal 16 S rRNA gene pool). Symbol “hospital” (square with cross): phylotype detected in intensive care unit (two intensive care units were screened). Symbol “square”: detected in a spacecraft assembly clean room (one facility was analyzed). Symbol “star” highlights phylotypes that were also found in the propidium monoazide (PMA)-treated sample, i.e. from cells with intact membranes. Scale bar refers to 10% nucleotide substitutions. Pyrobaculum arsenaticum and Thermofilum pendens (Crenarchaeota) were used as an outgroup."
