Phylogenetic trees of opossums. A. The phylogeny of didelphids resulting from a mixed-model Bayesian analysis of a combined-data matrix comprising DNA sequences from five nuclear protein-coding genes and morphological data [28]. Nodes that received Bayesian posterior probability values â‰¥0.95 in this analysis are indicated with black circles. B. The topology from A excluding Lestodelphys and Caluromysiops, (for which no vWF sequences are available). Branch lengths are shown as the estimated number of amino acid substitutions in vWF, assuming the JTT model of amino acid substitution as implemented in PAML [74]. Taxa that are known to eat pitvipers are indicated in bold; those that are known to exhibit resistance to pitviper venom are indicated with an asterisk. Metachirus (indicated with a dagger) has been challenged with pitviper venom but does not exhibit resistance. Branches that were included in the foreground for branch-site tests are shown with solid heavy lines. Venom resistance of Chironectes is unknown; therefore, this taxon was included in one set of branch-site tests and excluded from the other (indicated with a dashed heavy line). For the purpose of this analysis, Didelphis marsupialis includes its dubiously distinct sister taxon D. aurita."
