Neighbor-joining phylogenetic trees for neuropeptide GPCRs in Bombyx and Drosophila.The trees are rooted with DHR and BAR as outgroups for family A (rhodopsin-like) and family B (secretin receptor-like; shown in inset) GPCRs, respectively. Bootstrap support is indicated with an open circle for 50–70%, gray circle for 70–90%, and filled circle for 90–100%. Bombyx GPCRs are in bold type: AKHR, adipokinetic hormone receptor; BAR, Bombyx allatostatin (A-type) receptor; BMSR, Bommo-myosuppressin receptor; BRFaR, Bommo-FMRFamide receptor; DHR, diuretic hormone receptor; DpHR, diapause hormone receptor; PBANR, pheromone biosynthesis-activating neuropeptide receptor; SIFR, SIFamide receptor. The endogenous Drosophila ligands are given in parentheses: AKH, adipokinetic hormone; CCAP, crustacean cardioactive peptide; DH, diuretic hormone; ETH, ecdysis-triggering hormone; NPF, neuropeptide F; PDF, pigment-dispersing factor."
