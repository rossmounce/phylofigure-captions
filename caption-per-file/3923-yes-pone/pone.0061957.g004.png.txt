"pone.0061957.g004.png","Phylodynamics of influenza viruses in Taiwan.H3N2 and H1N1 phylodynamic patterns are shown on left and right end panels, respectively. (A) Bayesian skyline plots based on HA and (B) NA sequence data. The Y-axis represents a measure of relative genetic diversity and reflects the number of effective infections established by the virus. The black line is the median posterior value; the gray lines represent the 95% HPD intervals. (C) Surveillance of influenza activity in Taiwan. The different variants detected in the epidemics are represented by the same colors used in the MCC trees below. (D) MCC trees of the HA segment. Different seasons are represented in different colors, according to the legend in the figure. Trees are scaled in units of time with tips constrained to strain sampling dates."
