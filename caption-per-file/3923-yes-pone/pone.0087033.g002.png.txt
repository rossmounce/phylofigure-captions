"pone.0087033.g002.png","Neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree of partial pol genes from newly HIV-1 diagnosed MSM.A, Neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree for 131 pol sequences and relative reference sequences. B, CRF01_AE clade from the phylogenetic tree shown in A. Blue triangle: Kunming native MSM; green triangle: MSM form other cities in Yunnan Province; red triangle: MSM from other provinces. The sequences of MSM or other high-risk groups previously identified in China and Yunnan were included. The scale bar indicates 5% nucleotide sequence divergence. Values on the branches represent the percentage of 1000 bootstrap replicates and bootstrap values over 70% are shown in the tree."
