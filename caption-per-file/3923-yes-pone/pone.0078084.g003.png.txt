"pone.0078084.g003.png","Genealogical concordance analysis.Excised portions of phylogenetic trees based on beta tubulin (BT2), calmodulin (CF), minichromosome maintenance factor 7 (Mcm7) and RNA polymerase beta (RPB2). Bootstrap values above 90% are represented as bold lines. Talaromyces atricola is sibling to T. rugulosus at each locus supporting it as a distinct species. Penicillium scorteum has in the past been considered a synonym of T. rugulosus but this analysis shows that P. scorteum is conspecific with T. phialosporus."
