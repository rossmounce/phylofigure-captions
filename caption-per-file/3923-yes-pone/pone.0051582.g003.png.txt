Relationships within 14 C. jejuni isolates based on entire flaA sequences and flaA-SVR sequences.The generated phylogenetic tree of the entire flaA sequences had 11 terminal taxa (A), while the results of flaA-SVR sequence typing generated 8 different types (B). Dendrograms were generated using CLUSTREE neighbour-joining analysis. Scale bar: 0.02 divergent residues per site. Congruent topologies (P<25%) obtained using Geneious V5.1 (13)."
