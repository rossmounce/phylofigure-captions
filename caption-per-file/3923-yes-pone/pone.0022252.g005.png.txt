Tanglegram for the Totiviridae and their hosts. The parasite supermatrix was constructed using RASCAL and GBLOCKS alignment filtering, and the ‘theory’ host distances were used. Most (82%) links were significant according to the ParaFit test, which also rejected the global null hypothesis of no correspondence between host and Totiviridae phylogenies. The numbers on the branches within the parasite tree are maximum-likelihood bootstrap values ≥60%. ‘A’, ‘B’, ‘C’ and ‘D’ denote the major virus clades as discussed in the text. Host branches are colored according to their deep taxonomic affiliations: blue, Fungi (light blue, Ascomycota; dark blue, Basidiomycota); green, Viridiplantae; red, Metazoa; yellow, others. Stars on the host branches indicate those that were obtained by randomly resolving polytomies; all other branches were derived from the host classification."
