"pone.0030768.g001.png","Rooted phylogenetic tree constructed for partial 16S rRNA gene of isolates cultured from Helicoverpa armigera gut samples. A neighbor-joining analysis with Jukesâ€“Cantor correction and bootstrap support was performed on the gene sequences. Bootstrap values are given at nodes. Entries against (j) represent generic names and accession numbers (in parentheses) are from public databases. Entries from this work are represented as: clone number and accession number (in parentheses)."
