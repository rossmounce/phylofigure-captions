Comparative phylogenetic relationships of stolbur tuf-a vmp1 and stamp genotypes based on isolates sequenced for both genes, and corresponding secY genotypes.Bootstrap scores above 80 are given in following order, NJ, MP and ML. Lines show linked genotypes within isolates: congruent cluster?=?grey hatched line, incongruent cluster?=?bold full line. The Italian isolate Rome 7 exhibited the genotypes N11 (vmp1) and s6 (stamp), which belong to different clusters in the two phylogenetic trees (bold full line). Isolates with the vmp1 genotype N12 had stamp genotypes s1 (bold full line) or s5 (hatched line). Note that genotypes in France, Germany and Switzerland north of the Alps cluster together in both trees, and that secY genotypes cluster according to the vmp1 branching pattern. The secY genotype A is the ancestral tuf-a genotype. Geographic abbreviations: F?=?France, I?=?Italy, HR?=?Croatia, SLO?=?Slovenia, D?=?Germany, CH?=?Switzerland. The corresponding SEE-ERANET nomenclature of the tuf-a genotypes is given in Appendix S3."
