Mitochondrial Phylogeny. Majority rule consensus phylogenetic tree for 10 species of Cervidae inferred from concatenated 12S rRNA, 16S rRNA, ND1, ND2, COX1, COX2, ATP8, ATP6, COX3, ND3, ND4L, ND4, ND5, ND6, and CYTB gene sequences. Entries in parenthesis represent Genbank Accession Numbers. The Odocoileus virginianus consensus sequence was derived from this study. Start codons, stop codons, and overlapping regions of genes were excluded. Numbers beside branches indicate posterior probabilities estimated from a Bayesian analysis employing 2Ã—106 generations [35]."
