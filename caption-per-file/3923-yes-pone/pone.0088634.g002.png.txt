"pone.0088634.g002.png","Neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree showing the relationships of g20 amino acid sequence from paddy floodwaters in NE China with from those from lake freshwaters (Dorigo et al. 2004; Short and Suttle 2005; Wilhelm et al. 2006; Zhong and Jacquet 2013; Yeo and Gin, unpublished data which were submitted in Jan 15, 2013), paddy floodwaters in Japan (Wang et al. 2010), paddy field soils in Japan (Wang et al. 2011) and marine waters (Fuller et al. 1998; Zhong et al. 2002; Marston and Sallee 2003; Wang and Chen 2004; Mann et al. 2005; Short and Suttle 2005; Li and Li, unpublished data which were submitted in Jun 16, 2013).Green triangles and blue circles indicate g20 clones obtained from lake freshwater and marine water, respectively; Black and white square boxes indicate g20 clones obtained from paddy field soils in Japan and paddy floodwaters in Japan, respectively; White triangles indicate g20 clones obtained from paddy floodwaters in NE China. The number in parentheses denotes the accession number of amino acid sequences in the NCBI website. Bootstrap values <50 are not shown. The scale bar represents the number of amino acid substitutions per residue."
