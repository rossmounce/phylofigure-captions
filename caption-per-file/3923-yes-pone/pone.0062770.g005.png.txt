Molecular phylogeny of conserved and PMU-associated genes.The numbers on the internal branches indicate the percentage of bootstrap support based on 1,000 re-sampling (only values >80% are shown). (A) The organismal phylogeny based on the concatenated alignment of 214 single-copy genes conserved among the five phytoplasma genomes and the outgroup A. laidlawii (75,565 aligned amino acid sites). The tree topology is consistent with that inferred from 16S rRNA genes (Figure 1). (B) Molecular phylogeny of PMU-associated ATP-dependent Zn protease (hflB; 855 aligned amino acid sites). (C) Molecular phylogeny of PMU-associated replicative DNA helicase (dnaB; 533 aligned amino acid sites). (D) Molecular phylogeny of PMU-associated DNA primase (dnaG; 614 aligned amino acid sites). Note that the outgroup is not included in panels (B)-(D) because no PMU was found in the A. laidlawii genome."
