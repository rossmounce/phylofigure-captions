Phylogram of P. geminatum ( = C. geminatum) with other dinoflagellates inferred from 18S rDNA (left) and drawing of apical groove shapes for major related lineages (right).Sequences obtained in this study are bold-typed. Support of nodes is based on bootstrap values of ML/NJ with 1000 and 500 resamplings, respectively. Only values greater than 60 are shown. If only one of the two phylogenetic methods yielded significant support, the other is shown with “–”. Oxyrrhis marina was used as the outgroup to root the tree. Note that P. geminatum is affiliated within the Gymnodinium s. s. clade, grouped with Polykrikos with strong support. From bottom up on the right, C. polykrikoides has a U-shaped apical groove; the Gymnodinium s. s. clade has three major similar forms of anticlockwise apical grooves (apical views) documented so far: horseshoe-shaped apical groove for Lepidodinium spp./Gymnodinium spp., anticlockwise kidney bean-shaped open-ended loop for P. geminatum /Polykrikos spp., and closed horseshoe-shaped apical groove for P. lebourae."
