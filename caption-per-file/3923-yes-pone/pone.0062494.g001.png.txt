"pone.0062494.g001.png","Structural features of rice phospholipase C family.(A) Exon-intron organization is shown for both PI-PLC and NPC groups of rice PLCs and the gene names are mentioned at left. Genes are shown according to their phylogenetic clustering and not in the order of their numbers. Purple bars represent the exon, lines represent the intron while grey colour bars indicate the un-translated region (UTR) both at 5′ and 3′ position. (B) Protein structure of rice PLC gene family is showing the presence of highly conserved characteristic domains PI-PLC-X (Pfam identity- PF00388), PI-PLC-Y (PF00387) and C2 (PF00168) in all the PI-PLC members while EF hand like motif (PF09279) was marked only in two of the members. Phosphoesterase (PF04185) domain is present in all the NPC members. Numbers on each domain depict amino acid residue at the start and end of a particular domain and direction of a protein is depicted by N and C terminal."
