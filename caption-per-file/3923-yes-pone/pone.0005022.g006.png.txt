The panorama phylogenetic tree of subtype H5 influenza virus based on the viral HA sequences.The tree suggested that avian H5 influenza viruses isolated from the Western Hemisphere and the Eastern Hemisphere were located in the sublineages h5.1 and h5.2, respectively. The current HPAI H5N1 widely circulating in the Eastern Hemisphere formed a distinct sublineage (h5.2.3) within lineage h5.2 which were partially detailed in Text S2. For space limitation, most representatives within h5.2.3 were not shown in this figure. HPAI viruses were marked with “*”. Bootstrap values were given at relevant nodes."
