"pone.0064270.g003.png","The phylogenetic relationships of two domains of OsEV and homologous proteins from other organisms.A phylogenetic tree based on the glycosyltransferase sugar-binding domain (approximately 70 amino acids) (A) and a phylogenetic tree based on the capsular polysaccharide synthesis proteins (approximately 90 amino acids) (B) derived from different organisms and OsEV. The branch colors indicate the kingdom of each organism (bacteria in black, fungi in brown, plants in green, and viruses in red). The aLRT values were calculated using a SH-like method, and values greater than 0.5 are shown on the branches."
