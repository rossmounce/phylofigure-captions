"pone.0033310.g009.png","Phylogeny of archaeal and bacterial single-Xer recombinases. Species are representative of their respective taxonomic groups. XerC and XerD from E. coli and XerT from H. pylori were included in the study as reference. Amino acid sequence alignments were performed using Clustal W. The phylogenetic analyses, using the Neighbour-Joining method [34] were conducted in MEGA4 [33]. The percentage of replicate trees in which the associated taxa clustered together in the bootstrap test (1000 replicates) is shown next to the branches. The bootstrap consensus tree is taken to represent the evolutionary history of the taxa analysed. For each species, the accession number is indicated as well as the number of amino acid residues composing the recombinase."
