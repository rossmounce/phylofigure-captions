Phylogenetic tree of gibbons and outgroup primates based on the mtDNA concatenated dataset.The phylogenetic relationships among gibbons and six outgroup primates were inferred from the mtDNA concatenated dataset, including three partitioned sets: ribosomal RNA, transfer RNA and protein-coding gene. The maximum likelihood (ML), Bayesian and neighbor-joining (NJ) methods were used to reconstruct phylogenetic trees. All three analyses produced the same topology and their support values are indicated by circles on the nodes of the NJ tree shown here. Individuals used in the estimation of divergence times are marked with an asterisk."
