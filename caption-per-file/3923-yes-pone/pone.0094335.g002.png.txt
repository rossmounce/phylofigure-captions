Data summary and analytical results evaluating morphological integration in Plethodo salamanders.a) Positions of 11 anatomical landmarks used to quantify head shape in Plethodon salamanders (image from [72]). b) Fossil-calibrated molecular phylogeny displaying the estimated phylogenetic relationships among the species of Plethodon examined here. c) Plot of scores along the first axis for mandible shape versus cranial shape found from a partial least squares analysis of the evolutionary covariance matrix (R). Thin-plate spline deformation grids for the representing the extreme forms along each axis are shown (magnified by 2X)."
