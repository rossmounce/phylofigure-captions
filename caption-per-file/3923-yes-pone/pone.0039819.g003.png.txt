"pone.0039819.g003.png","Annotated phylogenetic trees for the gag- (Panel A), env (Panel B) and pol- (Panel C) genes.Phylogenetic trees were constructed using the Indian HIV-1 subtype C from clinical samples taken from different parts of India (shown in green), including southern (Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh), northern (Punjab and Haryana), north-eastern (Manipur) and central (Madhya Pradesh) regions of India plus data base retrieved reference sequences from western India and other countries, and two out-group subtype B strains. The Indian tMRCA included in this study were shown with an arrow. Pol-gene analysis was considered to provide the most reliable estimate of tMRCA (shown with a red arrow) for Indian HIV-1C, indicating around 1971 (95% CI: 1965–1976)]. Posterior probability plots showing the tMRCA estimates of Indian HIV-1C (Panel D): The posterior probability density plots for the three genes (env, pol and gag) point to a tMRCA for Indian HIV-1C from 36.9 (env), 40.5 (pol) and 44.3 (gag) years ago, with an overall mean for the combined graph at 40.6 years ago before 2011, that is in 1970.4 (95% CI: 1960.3–1978.1)."
