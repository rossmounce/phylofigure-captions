ML phylogram of the angiosperms.The tree has a –lnL = 938438.26. Numbers at the nodes are ML bootstrap support values. Three Camellia chloroplast genomes reported here are highlighted in bold. The red branches indicate that intact ycf15 gene is present in related species and asterisks on the top right corner of the species indicate putative losses of ycf15 gene. Scale bar indicates the increment of 0.01 substitutions per site."
