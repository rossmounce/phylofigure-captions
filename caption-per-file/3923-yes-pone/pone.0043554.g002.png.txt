"pone.0043554.g002.png","Phylogenies of Syndermata.Syndermate phylogenies reconstructed with ML and Bayesian analyses of concatenated mitochondrial protein alignments and rooted with Platyhelminthes or Chaetognatha. A, Acanthocephala; B, Bdelloidea; M, Monogononta; E, Eurotatoria (Bdelloidea Monogononta); L, Lemniscea (Bdelloidea Acanthocephala). Summaries of the two predominant topologies recovered are presented. Only support values for Eurotatoria and Lemniscea are shown as the monophylies of Bdelloidea, Monogononta, and Acanthocephala were always fully supported. All analyses performed with Platyhelminthes, except for one, produced the top phylogeny. Bootstrap support values and posterior probabilities from these analyses are listed in the following order: 1) ML MtRev, 2) ML JTT, 3) ML Partitioned data (models were assigned to each partition and partitions were generated by grouping together genes that shared the same model), 4) ML JTT on Dayhoff-recoded data, and 5) MrBayes MtRev. All analyses performed with Chaetognatha and one Platyhelminthes analysis recovered the bottom phylogeny. The first value represents the posterior probability from a Phylobayes analysis of Syndermata Platyhelminthes under a CAT Poisson model. The remaining values represent results from Syndermata Chaetognatha analyses: 1) ML MtRev, 2) ML JTT, 3) ML Partitioned, 4) ML JTT on Dayhoff-recoded data, 5) MrBayes MtRev, and 6) Phylobayes with CAT Poisson model. Lines represent number of amino acid substitutions per site. Summaries of strategies and support values provided in Table 2."
