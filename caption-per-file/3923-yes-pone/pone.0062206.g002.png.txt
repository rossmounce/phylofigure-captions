Phylogenetic analysis and exon–intron structures of grapevine expansin genes.(A) The deduced amino acid sequences of the grapevine expansins were aligned with MAFFT v6.0 software and the phylogenetic tree was constructed using the neighbor joining method in MEGA v4.0. The reliability of the predicted tree was tested by bootstrapping with 1000 replicates. The percentage of neighbor-joining bootstrap replications (>60%) is shown above each node. (B) Exon–intron structures of the grapevine expansin genes. On the left, exons are represented as boxes (drawn to scale) whereas introns are represented as lines (not drawn to scale). Blue, yellow and red boxes in exons indicate the HFD, Box 1 and Box2 motifs, respectively. On the right, the intron structure for each expansin gene is indicated, with positions as previously defined [8]. The intron in position H was defined in the present work."
