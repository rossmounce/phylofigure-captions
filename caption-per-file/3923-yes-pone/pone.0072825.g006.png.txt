Consensus phylogenetic tree of RIPs based on ML and MB analyses.Numbers below branches indicate Bayesian Posterior Probabilities (BPP) and numbers above branches are Bootstrap Support (BS) values from the ML analysis. The arrow indicates the node separating Group 1 and Group 2 of RIP genes (see the text for details). A, AB, and AC RIPs are indicated by thick continuous, thin continuous, and dashed lines, respectively. Black circles indicate those RIPs with demonstrated RNA N-glycosidase activity. GenBank accession numbers are shown for each sequence. G+ and G- indicate Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria, respectively."
