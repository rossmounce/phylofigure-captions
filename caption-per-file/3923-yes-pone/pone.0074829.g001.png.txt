"pone.0074829.g001.png","Global and seventh pandemic phylogeny.1a, a maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree of V. cholerae based on the SNP differences within the core genome. The 6 major O1 clinical groups are shown in this tree with the 7th pandemic El Tor in blue, classical lineage in green and other colours are match the colours of strains in Table S2. In red are the environmental non O1/O139 strains from Kenya. The date range on the wave 3 node is the BEAST estimated time when the seventh pandemic wave 3 cholera entered Kenya. 1b, a maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree of the 7th pandemic lineage of V. cholerae based on the SNP differences across the whole core genome, excluding likely recombination events. The pre-7th pandemic isolate M66 was used as an outgroup to root the tree. Blue, green and red branches and the clade cartoon represent wave 1, 2, 3 and Kenyan clade respectively. 1c, a maximum likelihood phylogenetic sub-tree showing the position of Kenyan sporadic or travel linked clustering with south Asian strains. All the scales are given as the number of substitutions per variable site."
