(A) Strict consensus of 2,610 most parsimonious trees of 509 steps recovered by initial analysis of all 41 taxa (38 oviraptorosaurs) included in the matrix. (B) Strict consensus of seven most parsimonious trees of 498 steps resulting from an analysis of 34 taxa (31 oviraptorosaurs), excluding all members of Caenagnathidae (as recovered by the initial trial) for which definitive mandibular material has not yet been discovered."
