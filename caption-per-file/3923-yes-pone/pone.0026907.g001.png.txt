"pone.0026907.g001.png","A tree of the E. coli strains (including Shigella strains) with full genome sequences. The phylogenetic tree was constructed based on the alignments of the core genomes of the 56 E. coli/Shigella genome sequences available (Table S9), including clone D (i2) and clone A (i1) described in this paper. The genome of E. fergusonii was used as outgroup. Bootstrap values are given at each node. The multiple genome sequences for E. coli K-12, E. coli B, and E. coli O157:H7 were each combined as a single entry."
