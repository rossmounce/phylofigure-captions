Neighbor joining trees based on mtDNA sequences from C. chameleon samples. (A) A tree constructed from 637 bp mtDNA fragments from 57 C. chamaeleon samples in Israel, one each from Portugal and Cyprus, and two from Turkey (Genbank accession numbers are shown). Collection sites are shown for each sample. To assess statistical significance the tree underwent a 1000 bootstrap replicates and scores (percentages) are mentioned near each branch. South –mtDNA genetic cluster including all samples south of the Jezreel Valley (see map in Fig 5). North –mtDNA genetic cluster including all samples north of the Jezreel Valley. For similar results using Network analysis – see Fig. S2. (B) A tree constructed from 11 whole mtDNA C. chamaeleon samples in Israel which were a subset of the samples analyzed in (A). Bootstrap scores of 1000 replicates are shown near each branch. All phylogenetic analyses were performed using MEGA 4.0."
