Significance testing evaluating the 16 S rRNA gene based taxonomic assignment of ‘Rickettsiella ixodidis’.Cladogram presenting the backbone tree topology generated by pruning off the terminal ‘Rickettsiella ixodidis’ branch from the 16 S rRNA gene based ML phylogeny of Figure 1. Terminal branches are labelled by genus and species, pathotype and/or original host designations as well as GenBank accession numbers. A set of 51 candidate topologies to be evaluated by the 1sKH test was generated by re-grafting the ‘R. ixodidis’ branch to any of the 51 branches of the backbone topology. Numbers on branches indicate the p-value attributed by the 1sKH test with respect to the 16 S rRNA gene alignment to the candidate topology that carries ‘R. ixodidis’ grafted to the respective branch. Candidate topologies that remain unrejected under application of a 5% significance threshold are indicated by the p-value printed in bold type; “B” designates the most likely tree."
