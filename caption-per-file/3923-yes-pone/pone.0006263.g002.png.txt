Phylogenetic positioning of MIP:The Phylogenetic positioning of MIP with respect to other members of genus Mycobacterium was performed by making concatenated tree of 16S rRNA, rpoB and hsp65 involving members of MAC and other environmental isolates, which are close to MIP. The alignment was carried out using clustal x ver 1.81[50] and a phylogenetic tree rooted to M. malmoense was constructed using Neighbor joining (NJ) method with 1,000 bootstrap iterations [51]."
