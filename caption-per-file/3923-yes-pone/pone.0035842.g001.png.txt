Neighbor-joining phylogram of the ACT1 gene intron of M. farinosa isolates.Bootstrap values (%) based on 1000 replicates are indicated at the nodes for main groups and clades. All positions containing gaps and missing data were eliminated from the dataset. Clades are indicated.Typical strains are in bold characters. Heterozygous alleles in hybrids were arbitrarily given the prefix A or B. Bar, 0.01 substitutions per site."
