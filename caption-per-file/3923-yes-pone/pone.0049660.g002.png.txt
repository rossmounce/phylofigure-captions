mtDNA and msatDNA gene tic analyses for Amphiprion. mccullochi.a) A phylogram of mtDNA (D-Loop) sequences from 118 A. mccullochi individuals from Elizabaeth Reef, Middleton Reef and Lord Howe Island. This represents the best ML tree from 10 individual analyses. Numbers on branches indicate support for each clade, based on phylogenetic analyses. b) Haplotype minimum spanning tree (MST) with the number of substitutions between haplotypes indicated on connectors. Different coloured fills represent each of the four populations from the three reefs as shown on the key to the figure. c) Scatterplots of the discriminant analysis of principal components of the microsatellite data for four Amphiprion mccullochi populations using geographic sample site as priors for genetic clusters. Individual genotypes appear as dots surrounded by 95% inertia ellipses. Eigenvalues show the amount of genetic information contained in each successive principal component with × and y axes constituting the first two principle components, respectively. Boxes indicate haplotype (h), nucleotide (π) and genetic diversity (gd) indices for A. mccullochi."
