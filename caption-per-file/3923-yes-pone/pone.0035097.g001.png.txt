Phylogenomic relationships among sequenced chlamydial genomes. The maximum-likelihood tree is based on 100 randomly chosen conserved orthologous genes. Bootstrap values are displayed at the branches. The panels show the within-species phylogenetic relationships of the sequenced genomes of Chlamydia pneumoniae (upper panel) and C. trachomatis (lower panel)."
