Phylogenomic and recombination characterization of HK PRRSV strains.(A) Genotype-specific (type 1 left; type 2 right) phylogenies of HK and globally sequenced PRRSV genomes. Type 1 strains form a monophyletic clade separate from isolates of any other country or region. Type 2 strains classified with either previously known local as known as “endemic” diversity or the “High-Fever”-like variants isolated during virulent outbreaks of PRRS in China. (B) Mapped recombination breakpoints and potential minor parental-like strains of mosaic HK PRRSV strains. Unknown designation (for a missing parental-like strain) was assigned when a recombination event was characterized from an alignment involving only one parental-like strain and the recombinant."
