"pone.0091887.g010.png","Phylogenies of PA (n = 520) genes.Tip and branch colors represent host origin (wild birds in green, domestic birds in red) of all of the Korean H7 viruses, and asterisks denote the Korean H7 viruses isolated in the present study. Phylogenetic trees were constructed using the maximum likelihood method with a general time-reversible model with invariant sites and 4 gamma-distributed heterogeneous substitution rates (GTR+ I Γ4 model) and 100 bootstrap replications (PB2 I = 0.308 α = 0.749; PB1 I = 0.377 α = 0.899; PA I = 0.320 α = 0.773; NP 0.409 α = 0.874; M I = 0.146 α = 0.435; NS I = 0.161 α = 0.768) in PhyML 3.0 (Guindon et al., 2010). Statistical support for the phylogenies was assessed by the approximate likelihood test using a Shimodaira-Hasegawa-like procedure in PhyML 3.0. The topology of trees was visualized in FigTree 1.4."
