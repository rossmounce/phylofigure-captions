LHP1 interacts with the RRM containing protein LIF2 in vitro and in vivo. (A) LIF2 structure and related proteins. NLS (dotted box), NES (black box), RRMs 1 to 3 (gray boxes), glutamic acid and aspartic acid (ED) -rich domain and glycine (G) -rich domain (hatched boxes). The phylogenetic tree was generated with the MultAlign program (Risler-50-0 parameters) (http://bioinfo.genotoul.fr/multalin/). At: A. thaliana; Ms: Medicago sativa; Os: Oryza sativa; Hs: Homo sapiens. (B) LIF2 interactions with LHP1 in yeast two-hybrid assays. 1, pBD-LHP1 and pAD-LIF2. 2, pBD-LHP1N and pAD-LIF2. 3, pBD-LHP1C and pAD-LIF2. 4, pBD-LHP1CSD and pAD-LIF2. 5, pTD1-1, encoding p53 (negative control) and pAD-LIF2. 6, pBD and pAD. 7, pBD-LHP1 and pAD-LHP1 (positive controls). Selective media lacking leucine (L), tryptophan (W) or histidine (H) and rich YPD medium were used. On YPD medium, interacting and non-interacting proteins resulted in white and red colonies, respectively. Î²-galactosidase activity was performed on X-Gal plates. (C) Pull-down assay with the LHP1:His6 fusion and the GST:LIF2, GST:LHP1 or GST proteins. 2% of the amount of LHP1:His6 used in the binding assay was loaded as reference sample (RS). (D) BiFC experiments. Upper panel: LHP1 dimerization in the nucleus. Lower panel: Nuclear interactions between LHP1 and LIF2. Epifluorescence (left and right panels) and bright field (middle panel) CLSM images."
