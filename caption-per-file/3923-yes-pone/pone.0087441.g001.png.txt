Phylogenetic analysis of the sequences generated during the evaluation of an in-house method.The phylogenetic tree was generated by using the PhyML software to create a maximum likelihood tree [13]. The reference sequences were obtained from the Los Alamos HIV Database (www.hiv.lanl.gov). IHDR- sequences generated by an in-house method; VSQ- sequences generated by the ViroSeq method; R1 to R5- sample used in the reproducibility study (hilighted in blue); P1 to P5- sample used in the precision study (hilighted in red); A, B, C, D, E are the replicates of the same sample."
