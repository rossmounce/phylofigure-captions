Deduced amino acid sequence and phylogenic analysis of DS1.(A) Alignment of deduced amino acid sequence of DS1 and its ortholog in N. tabacum (NtPAP), phosphatidic acid phosphatase 2-like proteins from Vitisvinifera (VvPAPLP), Thellungiellahalophila (ThPAP2LP), Arabidopsisthaliana (AtPAP2LP), and Oryzasativa (OsPAP2LP). Dots show identical amino acids, bars show amino acids that are not present in sequences. Boxes show conserved PAP catalytic motifs I, II, and III essential for PAP activity. Putative transmembrane motifs are shown in italic with underline. (B) Phylogenic tree of lipid phosphatases in plants. Gray boxes show DS1 and its ortholog in N. tabacum. The scale bar represents 0.1 JTT distance matrix units."
