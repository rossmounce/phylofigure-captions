"pone.0003926.g002.png","Synteny and phylogenetic analysis of zebrafish IGFBPs.A) Conserved synteny between human and zebrafish IGFBP-2 genes. Zebrafish igfbp-2a and igfbp-2b are located on linkage group (LG) 6 and 9, and human IGFBP-2 is located on chromosome 2. The human IGFBP-2 and IGFBP-5 are neighboring genes in a tail-to-tail orientation. Likewise, zebrafish igfbp-2a/igfbp-5a and igfbp-2b/igfbp5-b are also neighboring genes in a tail-to-tail orientation. B) Phylogenetic tree of IGFBP-2. Amino acid sequences of full-length IGFBP-2s were analyzed. Values on branches are percentages that the two clades branched as sisters (1000 run). The results indicate that teleost igfbp-2a and igfbp-2b are likely a result of a fish-specific genome duplication event."
