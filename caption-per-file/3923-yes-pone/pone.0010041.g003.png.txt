Phylogenetic comparison of PMMoV nucleotide sequences recovered in the present study and corresponding (a) to a region located near the 5′ end of the genome or (b) to a region in the capsid gene to PMMoV sequences selected from GenBank.Footnote: The phylogenetic trees were constructed using the neighbor-joining method based on the 5′ region (a) of the PMMoV genome or a region in the capsid gene (b). The PMMoV sequences recovered from patients' stool in the present study are in the boldface, white font and are indicated by a black square. Their name is labeled as follows: Mars_Laboratory identification number_Gender-Age_Clinical unit where the patient received care. The PMMoV sequences recovered from food products in the present study are in a boldface and are indicated by a gray square. Their name is labeled as follows: Mars_Name of the food product_Country where food product was manufactured. The remaining PMMoV sequences were obtained from GenBank. Their name is labeled as follows: GenBank Accession no._Coutry of origin_Year of submission to GenBank. Bootstrap values are indicated when greater than 50% as a percentage obtained from 1,000 resamplings of the data. The scale bar indicates the number of nucleotide substitutions per site. The sequence of Tobacco mild green mosaic virus (GenBank Accession No. NC_001556) and Tropical soda apple mosaic virus (GenBank Accession No. AY956381) were used as outgroups."
