"pone.0049718.g004.png","Phylogenetic tree of TaRPK1-2G and its orthologs.Neighbor Joining phylogenetic tree of the kinase domains of TaRPK1-2G and its orthologs from other 31 plant species was constructed using MEGA4.1. Bootstrap support on the left of each node was inferred from 1,000 replicates. The full names of all species and accession number or locus name of each sequence used for phylogenetic analysis were provided in Form S1."
