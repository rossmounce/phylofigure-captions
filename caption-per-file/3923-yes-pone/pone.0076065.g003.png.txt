The phylogenetic tree of KIFC1 protein and its homologues.This figure shows the phylogenetic tree of KIFC1 and it homologues that were constructed by the neighbor-joining method using Mega 5 (version 5.0) software. The KIFC1 homologues from Eriocheir sinensis, Gallus gallus, Xenopus laevis, Homo sapiens, Danio rerio, Salmo salar, Rattus norvegicus, and Cynops orientalis were examined. The putative E. modestus KIFC1 protein is most closely related to Eriocheir sinensis."
