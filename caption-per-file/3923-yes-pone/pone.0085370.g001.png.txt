"pone.0085370.g001.png","Bayesian phylogenetic tree inferred evolutionary relationships among BFDV full genome sequences from orange-bellied parrots.Maximum clade credibility tree automatically rooted by using relaxed molecular clock model in Beast v1.7.5. Labels at branch tips refer to GenBank accession number, and with country code, original sample ID, collection site and year of isolation in parentheses. Nodes with posterior probability of ?0.95 are indicated with asterisks and with a hash for P?0.7. Inferred nonsynonymous substitutions at codons are indicated at the appropriate lineages where the majority of genomes in a clade possess a particular substitution then the ancestral node has been labeled."
