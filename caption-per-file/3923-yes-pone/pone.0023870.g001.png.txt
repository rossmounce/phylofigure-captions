"pone.0023870.g001.png","The phylogeny of M. tuberculosis in South East Asia. Large sequence polymorphisms define six major lineages of M. tuberculosis (A) which are strongly associated with specific geographical regions (B). In Vietnam, three lineages cause the majority of disease: the East Asian/Beijing, the Indo-Oceanic, and the Euro-American (adapted from reference 1). Numercial values in the figure represent regions of deletions (RD) that define each of the lineages."
