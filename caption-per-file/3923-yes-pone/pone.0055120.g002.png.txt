Bayesian phylogenies for six representative proteins that are highly divergent in East Asian H. pylori strains compared to non-Asian strains.These include CagA (HP0547), VacA (HP0887), HpaA-like protein (HP0492), HopK (HP0923), HopL (HP1157), and a VacA-like protein (HP0922). The best available model of evolution was determined with ProtTest and phylogenies were inferred using MrBayes. Asterisks indicate posterior probabilities greater than 0.75. Sequences from East Asian strains (boxed) are highly divergent when compared to corresponding amino acid sequences from non-Asian strains of H. pylori. Scale bars show number of substitutions per site."
