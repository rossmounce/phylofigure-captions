Integrated charting capabilities.Charting integrated within phylogenetic trees are powerful visualizations that are capable of conveying a lot of information. jsPhyloSVG currently supports two charting formats: binary and bar charts. Binary charts feature a ribbon that may be color-coded to indicate groups. Bar charts are utilized to convey a quantitative figure relative to others, such as the number of clones. An unlimited number of chart tracks may be integrated within the visualization."
