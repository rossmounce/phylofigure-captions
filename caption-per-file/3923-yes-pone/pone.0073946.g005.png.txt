Phylogenetic distribution of exon coding indels in the five Rosaceae chloroplast genomes.The phylogenetic tree was a subtree of the one in Figure 4. Gene names are given above boxes, sizes of indels (bp) and polarity (‘+’ = insertion, ‘-’ = deletion) are given below boxes, and numbers following * in parentheses indicate indels which appeared no less than twice in one gene. Polarity of mutations was determined by comparison to the outgroup, F. vesca."
