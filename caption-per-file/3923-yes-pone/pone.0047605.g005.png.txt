"pone.0047605.g005.png","Maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees for three fragments of the one out of 57 viral quasispecies for subject 510 as identified by SimPlot analysis. Fig 5A: A single viral sequence in subject 510 with distinct recombination pattern, D/U/D. The bootscan plot was generated by Simplot. HIV-1 subtype D is shown in the blue bar and unclassified region is shown in the black bar. Figs. 5B, 5C & 5D: Maximum likelihood (ML) trees of three fragments classified as subtype D (nucleotide position 6,615 to 7,345, Fig. 5B), unclassified fragment (nucleotide position 7,346 to 7,500, Fig. 5C) and fragment classified as subtype D (nucleotide position 7,501 to 7,745). The viral quasispecies were analyzed with reference sequences from the Los Alamos HIV Sequence Database. The first fragment clustered with subtype D with a high aLRT support value (shown in light blue square), the second fragment clustered with subtype A1 but aLRT was insufficient (0.81; shown in black square). The third fragment clustered with subtype D with a weak aLRT support (0.87). Scale at the bottom of the Figure corresponds to 0.1 nucleotide substitutions per site."
