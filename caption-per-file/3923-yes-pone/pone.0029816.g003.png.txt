"pone.0029816.g003.png","Topological comparison of benchmark nr28S and four selected candidate genes. (A) 71 nuclear large subunit (nr28S) sequences (alignment size: 915 bp) (B) 26 cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 (coI) sequences (1057 bp), (C) 92 calmodulin sequences (154 bp), (D) 73 rad24 sequences (580 bp), and (E) 71 actin sequences (925 bp). The nr28S topology is used here as the benchmark marker, with colors corresponding to clades A (red), B (pink), C (green), D (brown), E (orange), F (dark blue), G (yellow), and H (light blue). Phylogenies are rooted using the dinoflagellates Gymnodinium simplex, Pelagodinium beii, and Polarella glacialis. Detailed phylogenetic reconstructions, including node support values from the ML bootstrap analyses and Bayesian posterior probabilities, as well as the GenBank accession numbers, are shown in Figures S1, S2, S3, S4, S5."
