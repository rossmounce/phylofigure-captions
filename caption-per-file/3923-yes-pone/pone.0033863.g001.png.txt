Phylogenetic tree of CRAL_TRIO and BCH domains from the Sec14 superfamily. This bootstrapped Neighbor Joining tree includes 175 BCH domains and 98 CRAL_TRIO/BCH-like domains from multiple organisms. The tree is displayed in a circular mode and different groups are marked by colored stripes. The clades with branch length Table S1. The abbreviations used are as follows; Dr: Danio rerio, Tn: Tetraodon nigroviridis, Ci: Ciona intestinalis, Dd: Dictyostelium discoideum, At: Arabidopsis thaliana, Rc: Ricinus communis, Pt: Populus trichocarpa, Gm: Glycine max, Mt: Medicago truncatula, Ps: Picea sitchensis, Zm: Zea mays, Os: Oryza sativa. This phylogenetic tree shows the distinct clustering of BCH domains from CRAL_TRIO domains. The three BCH subgroups are group I, group II and group III respectively and distinct groups within the CRAL_TRIO domain are also marked accordingly. Each cluster represents a distinct domain architecture. Pfam does not recognize the complete domain in BCH groups. The CRAL_TRIO_N domain, which is characteristically associated with CRAL_TRIO domains, is also missing in BCH and BCH-like (NF1 and RhoGEF) proteins. Similar to NF1 protein, Dictyostelium discoideum has an ancestral BCH sequence, which is associated with a RasGAP domain."
