Hypothetical phylogenetic history of mating types and S8/S6 ratio in Gerridae.Changes of the color of branches represent the evolution of mating types. Squares at the tips of the terminal branches indicate current mating types. Numbers beside the terminal branches are mean S8/S6 ratios of species (see Table S2). Ancestral S8/S6 ratios at each node were produced by PGLS method using COMPARE 4.6b [39]. Triangles (pointing up) indicate significant increases in S8/S6 ratio during evolution. Inverted triangles (triangles pointing down) indicate significant decreases in S8/S6 ratio. Pictures of female abdominal tips were modified from Andersen [13], Andersen & Spence [51] and Stichel [52]. DC, direct coercive mating; P1, Persuasive mating type 1; P2, Persuasive mating type 2."
