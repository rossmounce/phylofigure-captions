Bayesian phylogram for the unabridged adh1 dataset, including outgroups and placement of all sequences obtained from Panicum; numbers above branches indicate posterior probabilities above 0.5.Letters indicate well-supported clades, inferred to correspond to genomic groups. Taxon labels are in the format: virgatum 414069_A4.2 - up −8x where virgatum 414069 is P. virgatum (PI 414069), A4.2 indicates sequence type A4, for which we recovered 2 clones, “up” is the upland ecotype, and 8x is the inferred ploidy level inferred from flow cytometry."
