"pone.0053025.g005.png","Expression of Ifi202b in different inbred strains of mice.(A) Strains in which Ifi202b is expressed as detected by microarray [36] are marked in black, lack of Ifi202b expression is marked in red. The figure shows a phylogenetic tree of 28 strains. It was generated by the Mouse Phylogeny Viewer (http://msub.csbio.unc.edu/) [37] based on SNP information of the segment 175,860,234?175,928,281 bp (Chr. 1, NCBI Build 37/mm9). Of these 28 strains, 22 express Ifi202b, whereas 6 do not. (B) Quantitative real time PCR performed on white adipose tissue of indicated mouse strains as described in the Method section. (C) PCR products received by amplification of Ifi202b cDNA (white adipose tissue) between exon 1 and exon 2 as indicated in the scheme. (D) The different size of the PCR product is the result of integration of 68 bp between the sequence of exon 1 and exon 2 as indicated in red. Sequence of SJL corresponds to EST clone M31418, sequence of NZO exhibits GenBank accession number BankIt1573081 JX945582."
