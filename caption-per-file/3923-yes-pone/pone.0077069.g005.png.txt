"pone.0077069.g005.png","Phylogenetic relationships of the cloned B. improvisus NAKs.A phylogenetic tree was constructed using N-terminal truncated NAK sequences from B. improvisus and other metazoan organisms, e.g. humans, zebrafish, insects, crustaceans, and other invertebrates, as well as choanoflagellates. As outgroup, Na+/K+ ATPases from the slime mold Dictyostelium were used. In addition, human H+/K+ ATPase was added. The B. improvisus Nak1 sequence was found in the same clade as other arthropod Nak1 sequences. However, no clear-cut orthologues to the Balanus Nak2 were found. In general, Nak2 sequences have diverged more rapidly in relation to Nak1. Nak1 branches are shown in red, Nak2 branches in green. The divergent Drosophila NAK (CG3701) branch and the C. elegans catp-4 branch are shown in black. Choanoflagellate NAKs are shown in blue. Balanus Nak1 and Nak2 are marked with arrows. Scale bar shows expected number of changes per site. For abbreviations of species names and accession numbers see Table S3."
