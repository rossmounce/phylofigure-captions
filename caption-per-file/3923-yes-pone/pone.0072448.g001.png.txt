"pone.0072448.g001.png","ML phylogenetic tree of HIV-1 subtype B pol (?1000 pb) sequences circulating in Cuba (n?=?322), US (n?=?525), France (n?=?348), and other Caribbean countries (n?=?418).The branches are colored according to the origin of each sequence, as indicated at the legend (bottom left). The circular brackets highlight the position of the pandemic (BPANDEMIC, green line) and non-pandemic (BCARIBBEAN, blue line) HIV-1 subtype B clades. Shaded boxes highlight the position of the two major HIV-1 subtype B Cuban clades (BCU-I and BCU-II). The number of Cuban sequences distributed accordingly to the clade size is shown (top left). Key nodes with aLRT support values >0.80 (*) and ?0.90 (**) are indicated. The tree was rooted using HIV-1 subtype D reference sequences (gray branches). The branch lengths are drawn to scale with the bar at the bottom indicating nucleotide substitutions per site."
