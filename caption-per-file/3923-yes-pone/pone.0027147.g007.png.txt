Revision of bivalve phylogeny and systematics. The evolutionary tree was sketched as outlined in this paper (see text for details). Superfamilial relationships are shown, with proposed ordinal classification; for anomalodesmatans, we used the nomenclature from Newell [13] and Vokes [63]. Color code as in Figure 5. Asterisks mark newly-proposed ordinal categories; Neoheterodontei sensu [31] and Amarsipobranchia (comprising subclasses Anomalodesmata, Heterodonta, and Pteriomorphia) are also shown."
