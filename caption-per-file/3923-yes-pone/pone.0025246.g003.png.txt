"pone.0025246.g003.png","The states of LSCs can be used to infer the Fpg/Nei family phylogeny. The most parsimonious protein phylogeny consistent with the states of the six LSCs is shown with the changes in LSCs annotated as red bars. The choice of the root results in one of its children (BaFpg1, BaFpg2) represents well the diversity of bacteria while the other represents plants, fungi, and metazoans."
