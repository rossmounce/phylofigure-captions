"pone.0059422.g002.png","Bayesian coalescent and discrete phylogeography analyses of Brazilian DENV-2 based on envelope nucleotide sequence.Subtree of the maximum clade credibility tree was inferred using 144 DENV-2 envelope sequences (1,485 nt). The subtree containing isolates of the American/Asian genotype is displayed here. Time of the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) was estimated using the year of isolation as the calibration point, under the relaxed molecular clock, with the Tamura Nei Model, with discrete Gamma distribution and an estimated nucleotide substitution rate of 7.5?4. The posterior probabilities values ?0.96 are represented by (*) and values ?0.99 are represented by (**), inside the nodes. The years that the MRCA was estimated to exist are shown for some nodes with upper and lower intervals in parenthesis. The origin value of the reverse scale axis corresponds to year 2010. Using different colors, (legend shown on the left side), terminal branches were annotated based on geographic location of DENV-2 isolates. Internal nodes of the tree which presented modal state posterior probability ?0.60 were also colored according to their most probable location states, inferred by discrete phylogeographical analysis. Brazilian lineages are delimited by square brackets. For clarity purposes some branches were collapsed. SJRP/2008 contains 11 isolates from S?o Jos? do Rio Preto/S?o Paulo/Brazil (DENV-2/BR/BID-V3653/2008, -V3638/2008, -V3640/2008, -V3483/2008, -V3637/2008, -V3495/2008, -V3645/2008, -V3481/2008, -V3486/2008, -V3650/2008 and -V3648/2008); CU/US/KN 1997?2001 contains isolates from Cuba (Cuba115/97 and Cuba165/1997), Puerto Rico (US/BIC-V1387/1998) and Saint Kitts and Nevis (KN/BID-V2951/2001); VE/CO/GU/BZ/MX 1999?2009; PR 1986?1995 and PR 1994?2007 contain the same isolates as described in the Figure 1 caption. Analyses were performed using programs from BEAST package v.1.6.1, BEAUTi, Tracer v.1.5.0, TreeAnotator v.1.6.1 and FigTree v.1.3.1 (B) Map of Brazil showing the macro-regions and states. The black pin indicates the approximate location of S?o Jos? do Rio Preto/S?o Paulo/Brazil."
