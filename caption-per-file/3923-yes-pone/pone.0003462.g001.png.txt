"pone.0003462.g001.png","Multiple introductions of HPAI H5N1 into Vietnam from 2001 to 2007.(A) Phylogenetic tree of subtype H5 HA genes from avian influenza viruses. The phylogenetic tree was constructed by Maximum Likelihood using GARLI version 0.951 [34] by selecting GTR+I+G model from Modeltest 3.7 [37]. Posterior probabilities and bootstrap values were given above and below branches, respectively. The phylogenetic tree was rooted by Ck/Scotland/59. Each avian influenza gene precursor was defined with the shortest phylogenetic distance to the Vietnam lineages: HK97-, HK821-, E319-, FJ584-, GX22-, and F1-, GX604-, and GX4016-like (Table 2). The viruses isolated from Vietnam are marked in colors other than black. The predicted precursor viruses are shown in boxes. A detailed tree showing the HK821-like lineage can be viewed in Figure S2. (B) Yearly H5N1 isolation in Vietnam by HA clade. The horizontal arrows denote the year in which the viruses were detected. The vertical line to the right of an arrow denotes that the particular HA clade was not detected in subsequent years. Triangles depict the time of isolation of the postulated precursor virus. These six distinct HA clades were apparently introduced into Vietnam between 2001 and 2007 approximately."
