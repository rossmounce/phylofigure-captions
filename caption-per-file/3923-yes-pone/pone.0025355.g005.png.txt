Species trees estimated with concatenation and coalescent approaches. Panel A: Bayesian phylogram of concatenated matrix; posterior probabilities shown for all nodes. Panel B: Phylogeny estimated with *BEAST; posterior probabilities shown for all nodes. Patterns of syntopy displayed for Aliatypus, corresponding to Table 3. Outgroups have been removed from species trees for illustration purposes."
