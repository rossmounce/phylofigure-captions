The ML tree and networks for COI. (A) Maximum-likelihood phylogeny on the basis of the mitochondrial COI sequences.A 50% majority-rule consensus bootstrap tree is shown, with bootstrap values over 50% at the nodes. (B) Network on the basis of the mitochondrial COI sequences constructed with software NETWORK4.5. In the figures, yellow dots indicate the haplotypes from Genus Polytremis and red dots indicate the haplotypes from outgroups. The sequences are labelled according to the numbers shown in Table 1."
