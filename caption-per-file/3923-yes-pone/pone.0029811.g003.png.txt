Evolution of RNAi sensitivity in the Caenorhabditis genus. The RNAi results are displayed on the phylogeny from [17], for the different dsRNA administration methods and for different genes. The red stars indicate a loss of sensitivity to ingested Oti-actin dsRNAs in a parsimonious evolutionary scenario (see text). Note that the absence of an external Oti-actin RNAi response may correspond to an inability to respond either to all ingested dsRNAs (as in C. briggsae and likely in C. drosophilae), or only to specific dsRNAs (as in C. elegans JU1580 and C. angaria). In blue: results from [13]. In green: result`s from [5]. The dsRNAs for the ama-1 gene were specific to the tested species. We did not find differences among different tested isolates of C. briggsae and C. sp. 7 (see Materials and Methods for the identity of other tested strains), nor did Winston et al. for different isolates of C. brenneri [5]. C. brenneri can respond to ama-1 dsRNAs if they are injected into the gonad, indicating that this species is defective in the systemic spread of the signal from body cavity to gonad. I: Elegans supergroup of Caenorhabditis species; II: Drosophilae supergroup as in [17]."
