Population-level analyses. A: a Minimum Spanning Tree for all sequences more than 94% similar to abundant Anaeromyxobacter sequence R100. Circle size equates with the number of sequences, bar length equates with the number of nucleotide substitutions between sequences. B: a NeighbourNet phylogenetic network based on the same sequences as in A."
