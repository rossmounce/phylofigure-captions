Selection of a CXCR4-using variant above the 454 sequencing error threshold during persistent viremia suppression in Subject 26.Panel A, antiretroviral treatment history, virological and immunological evolution. Continuous line, HIV-1 RNA levels; dashed line, CD4+ counts; horizontal bars, time period during which a given antiretroviral drug was prescribed. Vertical lines indicate the timepoints when 454 sequencing was performed. LPVr, lopinavir/ritonavir; AZT, zidovudine; ddI, didanosine; RAL, raltegravir. Panel B, maximum likelihood nucleotide-based phylogenetic tree including V3-loop haplotypes present at a frequency ≥0.6% in the virus population in plasma (triangles), PBMCs before therapy initiation (circles) and PBMCs after persistent viremia suppression (squares). The tree is rooted at the most frequent plasma sequence before antiretroviral treatment initiation. Filled symbols show predicted CXCR4-using viruses; open symbols show predicted CCR5-using viruses. Symbol size increases proportionally to the V3-loop haplotype frequency in the virus population in 10% intervals. Node reliability was tested using 1000 bootstraps; bootstrap values ≥50% are shown. The V3-loop aminoacid sequence translation is shown next to each taxon. Aminoacid changes relative to the predominant sequence in plasma are highlighted in bold and underlined. Gaps correspond to aminoacid indeterminations. A Geno2Pheno [coreceptor] false positive rate (FPR) equal or lower than 10% was used to define CXCR4 use. The actual false positive rate of each sequence is shown. *Sequence #2 was identical to one detected in 0.04% of PBMC-associated viruses, below the error threshold, before treatment initiation."
