Evolutionary relationships of 19 known insect DH-PBAN amino acid sequences inferred using the neighbor-joining method.The phylogenetic tree was constructed based on a JTT matrix with 1000 bootstrap replicates by MEGA5 software. The percentages of bootstrap support above 50% are shown next to the branches. The tree is drawn to scale, with branch lengths in the units of the number of amino acid substitutions per site. The corresponding taxonomic families, superfamilies and orders of the taxa and clades are listed at the right."
