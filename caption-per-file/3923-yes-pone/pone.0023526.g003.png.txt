Maximum likelihood (ML) phylogeny of Radiolaria inferred from an 18S 28S rDNA alignment consisting of A) 24 taxa and 4163 characters, and B) 27 taxa and 4163 characters (including Foraminifera). Values at nodes represent bootstrap support values from ML analysis and Bayesian posterior probabilities (pp) (ML/pp). Filled circle indicate maximum support in both analyses. Numbers in parenthesis represent the peak support values after removing fast evolving sites for selected nodes (cf. Table S3 and S4)."
