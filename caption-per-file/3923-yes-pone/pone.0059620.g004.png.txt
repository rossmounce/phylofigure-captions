"pone.0059620.g004.png","ML phylogram of 55 taxa based on ycf15 gene sequences.The analyzed genes include both intact and disabled sequences. The tree has a –lnL = 1983.94. Bootstrap support values >50% are given at nodes. The red branches indicate that intact ycf15 gene is present in related species. Scale bar indicates the increment of 0.01 substitutions per site."
