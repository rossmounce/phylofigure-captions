"pone.0013583.g001.png","Phylogenetic analyses of partial NS1 gene nucleotide sequences from PBoV and other bocavirus members.The phylogenetic tree was constructed by the neighbor-joining method with 1,000 bootstrap replicates, using the MEGA 4.1 software. Black circles designate reference strains, and the others are sequences generated from the present study. PBoV1 and PBoV2 are indicated with black diamonds. MVC: minute virus of canines; BPV: bovine parvovirus. HBoV: human bocavirus."
