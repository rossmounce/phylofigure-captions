Burkholderia tree with the phylogenetic position of the newly discovered endophytes.This phylogenetic dendrogram is based on the concatenated dataset of the 16S rRNA gene, gyrB gene and recA gene. Several clades are evident: the pathogenic group, a clade with B. glathei and related endophytes, and the plant-associated beneficial and environmental (PBE) group sensu Su?rez-Moreno et al. (arrows). Most of the new endophytes fall in the latter group, except for the bacteria in Globulostylis, which are more related to the previously described Candidatus species. We therefore combine the B. glathei clade with the PBE group sensu Su?rez-Moreno et al., to form a broadly defined PBE group. Bayesian posterior probabilities/bootstrap values are indicated below the branches."
