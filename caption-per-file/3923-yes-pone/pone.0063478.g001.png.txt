"pone.0063478.g001.png","Comparison between Piptadenia’s group plant phylogeny and the occurrence of alpha and beta-rhizobia as nodule symbionts in the field or during coinoculation experiments. The plant phylogeny (A) is based on a trnL-F/trnK-matK combined dataset, and was built by parsimony with TNT1.1 (default parameters, on www.phylogeny.fr) using the Jobson & Luckow [30] dataset (downloaded from Treebase, study number S1763, and amended with the P. trisperma from this study). The % of α and β-rhizobia per legume host (in bold) from field sampling (B) or from the coinoculation experiment (C) are represented as white (Burkholderia) and black (α-rhizobia) squares, with the number of strains sampled within each square. *: statistics of symbionts from [44] and [11]. The grey colored square for Stryphnodendron indicates that % of α-rhizobia originates from a trapping experiment on soil (see Material & Methods section)"
