Dendrogram including three instances of specimen and taxonomic confusion discussed in the text.Combined barcoding data from Mexico (MFL- and MX- prefixes) [24], [25] with our data (BLZ = Belize; CUR = Curacao; FCC = Florida; FL = Florida; SMS = Florida) and shown in a dendrogram for visualization purposes only, with no intent to show phylogenetic relationships. The triangles are to scale showing the maximum amount of genetic variation within the clade, which ranges from the straight line (no differences between individuals) of the bottom clade (Bairdiella chrysoura) to the largest intraspecific variation in the Eucinostomus gula clade (B-white triangle: largest pairwise genetic distance = 0.0894) Interspecific and inter-clade distances and significance is discussed in the text."
