Phylogenetic affiliation of sequences retrieved using cyanobacterial specific nifH genes as targets combined with DGGE analyses of sediment associated DNA samples from wetland meadows along three major rivers (Vindel, Pite, and Lais) in northern Sweden.The phylogram was constructed using the maximum likelihood distance method with TrNIG model. Sequences obtained here are given in bold. Each DGGE band sequence is designated by their accession number, a code and the name of the river/s were it was collected. The numbers given at the nodes represent bootstrap values."
