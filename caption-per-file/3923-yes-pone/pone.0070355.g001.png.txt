"pone.0070355.g001.png","Summary of cpcB.(A?B) cpcB mRNA levels during the life cycle of A. nidulans (A) and A. fumigatus (B). Conidia (asexual spores) are indicated as C. The numbers indicate the time (hours) after incubation in liquid MMG (Vegetative), and on solid MMG under conditions inducing conidiation (Asexual) or sexual development (Sexual). The relative band intensities (mean?SD) of Northern blot were determined by densitometric scanning of mRNA bands using ImageJ and each band was normalized by the amount of 18S rRNA (cpcB/18S rRNA) in the relevant lane. Ethidium bromide staining of ribosomal RNAs was used as a loading control. (C) Alignment of A. nidulans (Ani) CpcB, A. fumigatus (Afu) CpcB, A. flavus (Afl) CpcB with Gib2 of C. neoformans var. grubii (Cgr; accession: AY907679) and C. neoformans var. neoformans (Cne; accession: AY907680). ClustalW (http://align.genome.jp/) and BoxShade 3.21 (http://www.ch.embnet.org/software/BOX_form.html) were used for the alignment and presentation. (D) A phylogenetic tree of CpcB-like proteins identified in various fungal species including A. clavatus, A. flavus, A. fumigatus, A. nidulans, A. niger, A. oryzae, A. terreus (A?=?Aspergillus), C. neoformans, Neurospora crassa, Penicillium chrysogenum, Penicillium marneffei, Schizophyllum commune, Schizosaccharomyces japonicus and Talaromyces stipitatus. The putative CpcB proteins were retrieved from NCBI BlastX (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi) using A. nidulans CpcB. A phylogenetic tree of 14 putative CpcB homologues was generated by the TreeTop software (http://genebee.msu.su/services/phtree_reduced.html) using the alignment data from ClustalW. The phylogenetic tree is constructed based on the matrix of pairwise distances between sequences. Numbers indicate the computed distances given the residue substitution weights from the alignment data [59]."
