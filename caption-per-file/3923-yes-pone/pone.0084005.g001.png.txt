Figure 1. Phylogenetic analysis of the 14 clones derived from the Guilin recombinant compared with reference strains.GenBank accession numbers and clone numbers are showed on each tree, and the genotype is indicated after every accession number. Bootstrap values are showed at each nodes, and only bootstrap values of >70% are indicated. Phylogenetic trees comparing the 14 clones with 34 reference strains representing genotypes Aâ€“H, were constructed based on the S gene (A), pre-S region (B) and whole genomes (C). And the phylogenetic tree was constructed by comparing the Guilin recombinant with the Vietnam, Thailand and Long An recombinants as well as HBV C subgenotype based on the whole genomes (D)."
