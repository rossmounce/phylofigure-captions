Distribution of the orthologues of the hamster midbody among eukaryotic lineages.Number of orthologues of the mammalian-midbody components present in each of the 32 eukaryotic species (A) and in the ancestor of each of the six main eukaryotic phyla (B). Colours represent the functional categories defined by Skop, et al. [22]. The phylogenetic relationships between the lineages analysed are indicated on the left. Numbers at nodes indicate the number of orthologues inferred to be present in the corresponding ancestors."
