"pone.0018871.g006.png","Phylogenetic tree of Myxozoa based on SSU rDNA gene sequence. The Bayesian tree was reconstructed using MrBayes 3.1.2 with a GTR+G+I nucleotide model from the stringent Alignment 3, for details about alignment and phylogenetic reconstruction see Materials and Methods and Figure S1. For details on biological traits and GenBank accession numbers see Table S4. Bayesian posterior probabilities are shown at the nodes. The myxosporean sequences fall into marine and fresh clades; the exceptions are Sphaeromyxa spp. and Zschokkella icterica sequences from marine fish that cluster in the fresh water clade [43]. Myxosporean species with documented actinospore development are underlined."
