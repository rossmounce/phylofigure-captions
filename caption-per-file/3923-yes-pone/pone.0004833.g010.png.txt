Phylogeny estimation of 18 putative vir genes of the Rickettsia T4SS.Single most parsimonious tree of 12716 steps (6858 parsimonious characters of 28554 total characters). Branch support is from 1 million bootstrap replications. Taxon codes and coloring scheme as described in the Figure 9 legend. Statistics to the right of taxon codes: number of T4SS genes; number of nts encoding T4SS; percentage of genome encoding T4SS. Cladogram on right depicts phylogeny of core orthologous groups (proteins) [80]. Inset shows statistics computed for eight nodes of the tree, following our classification scheme [81]."
