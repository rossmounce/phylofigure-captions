"pone.0051636.g002.png","Clustering and principal components analysis of morphological markers.Boxplots of the first three principal component axes (center) for each morphological group (A, B) retrieved by hierarchical clustering (shown right). Positive values of the PC axes indicate larger body dimensions, whilst negative values indicate smaller body dimensions. Morphological groupings are shaded as follows: A1 =  bright green, A2 =  lime green, A3 =  green, B1 =  blue, B2 =  purple. The phylogenetic tree (left) is color coded by species according to its morphological group membership. Morphological measurements are shown on lizard schematic, and line colors correspond to sets of original variables that loaded onto each PC (PC1 =  red, PC2 =  yellow, PC3 =  light blue). Percentage of variation contributed to each PC axis is given. Key to the species abbreviations as in Fig. 1."
