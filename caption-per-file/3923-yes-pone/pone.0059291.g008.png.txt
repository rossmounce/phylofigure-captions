"pone.0059291.g008.png","Phylogenetic relationship of birds used in this study.The phylogenetic tree is based on documented literature [27], [28], [29], [30], [32], [34], but the relationships within Phasianidae (quail, bamboo partridge, chicken, peafowl, and turkey) were simplified due to the lack of consensus among proposed phylogeny. The presence (+) and absence (?) of Gal?1-4Gal or Gal?1-4Gal on glycoproteins are based on detections in various tissues from species indicated with an asterisk (*) or on detections on egg while/yolk glycoproteins from all species except bamboo partridge. mya, million years ago."
