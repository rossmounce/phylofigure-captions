"pone.0059565.g008.png","Unrooted randomized accelerated maximum likelihood (RAxML) phylogenetic tree of partial nuclear SSU rDNA of Picozoa.The phylogeny is based on 1253 aligned characters of the SSU rDNA and includes 201 sequences of Picozoa. Most sequences are database entries derived from clone libraries (nine environmental sequences generated from a sample taken at Helgoland Roads and one sequence from Picomonas judraskeda are new sequences; accession numbers of the newly determined sequences are presented in Fig. S2). Bootstrap values >60% and posterior probabilities >0.80 for the three methods of analyses used (RAxML/NJ by PAUP/MrBayes) are shown on the respective branches. Branches in bold show maximal (100%/1.00) support. Labeling of clades (‘BP1–3′) followed [Cuvelier et al. 2008], 12 novel clades (‘P1–P13’) are recognized (for details see Results). The sequence of Picomonas judraskeda (in bold) was positioned in clade ‘P3’ (shaded)."
