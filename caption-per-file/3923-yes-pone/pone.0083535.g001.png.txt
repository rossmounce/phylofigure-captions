Concentrated Maximum likelihood phylogeny tree (-ln likelihood=30921.31) of Brassicaceae FAE1 showing tribes.Numbers at branches are bootstrap percentages (the values less than 50% are not shown) of ML and MP and posterior probability of BI. Numbers or letters in brackets next to species represent different sequences downloaded from Genbank or different isoforms of the same species. See full Maximum likelihood phylogeny tree in Figure S1."
