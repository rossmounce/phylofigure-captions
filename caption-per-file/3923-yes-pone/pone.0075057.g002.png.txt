"pone.0075057.g002.png","Multiple alignment and phylogenetic analysis of Uniprot Ref50 groups of Myc proteins.A. Overview of the ClustalW 2.0 alignment of the representative Myc proteins. The gaps in the N-terminal part of the alignment are primarily due to the longer length of the fruit fly proteins in relation to Myc proteins from other species. B. Phylogentic tree showing relationships between the different Myc proteins. Bootstrap values are shown to indicate the level of support for the different parts of the tree topology shown. Well supported clades containing MycN and SMyc proteins (A), MycL proteis (B), c-Myc proteins (C) and dMyc proteins (D), as well as a less well supported clade containing Myc proteins from animals just outside the Craniata (E), are indicated."
