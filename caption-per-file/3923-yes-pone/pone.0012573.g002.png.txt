Alignment of truncated PTP domains of the NT4 non-receptor class.The PTP domains of genes of the NT4 class from several species were truncated to approximately correspond to the limited available sequence from si:dkey-78k11.1. The evolutionary history was inferred using the Neighbor-Joining method. The optimal tree with the sum of branch length = 3.38256318 is shown. The percentage of replicate trees in which the associated taxa clustered together in the bootstrap test (1000 replicates) are shown next to the branches. The tree is drawn to scale, with branch lengths in the same units as those of the evolutionary distances used to infer the phylogenetic tree. The evolutionary distances were computed using the Dayhoff matrix based method and are in the units of the number of amino acid substitutions per site. All positions containing alignment gaps and missing data were eliminated only in pairwise sequence comparisons (Pairwise deletion option). There were a total of 109 positions in the final dataset. Phylogenetic analyses were conducted in MEGA4."
