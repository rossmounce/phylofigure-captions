Identification of two type XXVII collagen genes in zebrafish.(A) Protein schematic showing domains of human and zebrafish type XXVII collagen. Blue: N-propeptide, Green: thrombospondin domain, Red: triple helical domain, Yellow: C-propeptide, Black: interruptions of the triple helix. Total protein length is listed in amino acids. (B) Fibrillar collagen phylogeny based on amino acid sequences from the conserved C-propeptide. Bayesian tree with posterior probabilities is shown. The two predicted type XXVII collagen proteins in zebrafish cluster with those of chicken, mouse and human (red box). Ci, Ciona intestinalis; Dr, Danio rerio; Gg, Gallus gallus; Mm, Mus musculus; Hs, Homo sapiens."
