Comparison of unrooted phylogenies of MTBC based on 97 global strains using various molecular markers.Colours indicate the main MTBC lineages as defined by MLSA and LSPs [31]. (A) Neigbour-joining (NJ) phylogeny based on 339 variable nucleotide positions in 89 genes using number of SNPs as distance. The same topology was obtained using NJ, Maximum likelihood (ML), and Bayesian inference (BI). Numbers indicate bootstrap support after 1,000 pseudoreplicates for NJ and ML, and a posteriori probabilities for BI, respectively (Figure S1). MTBC can be divided in two main clades, one evolutionary ‘modern’ (also known as ‘TbD1-negative’), which includes the blue, purple, and red strain lineages, and one evolutionary ‘ancient’ (TbD-positive), which includes the remaining strain lineages. (B) NJ phylogeny based on spoligotyping data and Jaccard distances. No bootstrap values could be calculated using these markers. (C) NJ phylogeny based on 15-loci-MIRU-VNTR data and Nei distances. Numbers indicate bootstrap support after 1,000 pseudoreplicates. (D) NJ phylogeny based on 24-loci-MIRU-VNTR data and Nei distances. Numbers indicate bootstrap support after 1,000 pseudoreplicates."
