Phylogenetic analysis of bacterial 16S rRNA DNA from the nose, oropharynx (OP) and left upper lobe (LUL) in adult patients with COPD (C) or asthma (A) and healthy controls (N).The numbers of 16S rRNA gene phylotypes (OTUs) were calculated at 97% sequence identity and single-sequence OTUs omitted. OTU designations are located at the termination of each branch and represent potential organism names. Abundance of OTUs in each subject is indicated by different coloured squares (Yellow = 1 single OTU, Orange = 3–10%, Red = 10–20% and Black≥20%)."
