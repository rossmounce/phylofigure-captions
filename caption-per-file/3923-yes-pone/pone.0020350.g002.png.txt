"pone.0020350.g002.png","Bayesian phylogenetic tree based on cyt-b haplotypes. Four distinct phylogroups (red, blue, green, purple) are visible. Posterior probability support values are shown above branches. Average sequence divergence between phylogroups ranges from 0.70% to 1.35%. A1–A6, B1–B8 and C1 sequenced during this study; BRA–BRI from [5]; BT from [7]. Columns show distribution of haplotypes between species/populations (▴ = P. arminjoniana (or dark-shafted birds), ▪ = P. neglecta (or white-shafted birds) • = P. heraldica, ★ = P. atrata, ♦ = intermediate). Frequency of each haplotype is also shown."
