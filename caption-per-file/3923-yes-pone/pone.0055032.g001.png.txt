Phylogenetic dendrogram of eleven AlaAT enzymes and two GGAT enzymes.A phylogenetic dendrogram was constructed using neighbour joining (NJ) based on amino acid sequence similarity using Vector NTI Advance v. 11.0, AlignX software. The sequences used to construct the dendrogram were obtained from the NCBI database except that of Medicago which was obtained courtesy of Anis Limami at the Universit? d' Angers."
