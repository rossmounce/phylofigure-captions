Phylogenetic relationships of Sauropterygia.1A) Current phylogenetic relationships of Sauropterygia. Phylogenetic hypothesis of early Sauropterygia summarized after Rieppel [1]. Hereafter the Nothosauroidea and Pistosauroidea (incl. Cymatosaurus) form the Eusauropterygia, which are combined with the Pachypleurosauroidea in the Eosauropterygia. Placodonts are regarded as a plesiomorphic sister group to all other Sauropterygia. All these groups appear nearly simultaneously in the early Anisian (early Middle Triassic). Nothosaurs and pachypleurosaurs vanish in the Ladinian (late Middle Triassic). Placodonts are known until the Rhaetian (Late Triassic). Among the Pistosauroidea Cymatosaurus is restricted to the Anisian, pistosaurs disappear in the Carnian (early Late Triassic). Plesiosauria are known from the Rhaetian (Late Triassic) until the end of the Cretaceous. 1B) Sauropterygian relationships modified after Holmes et al. [8] and own unpublished data. Holmes et al. suggested that the pachypleurosaur Keichousaurus is possibly a basal nothosaurid, questioning the monophyly of Pachypleurosauria [8]. The interrelationships of the Lower Muschelkalk pachypleurosaurs Dactylosaurus and Anarosaurus are also unclear (own data). Pachypleurosaur taxa are underlined in this figure."
