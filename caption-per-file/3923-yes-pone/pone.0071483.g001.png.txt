Phylogenetic analysis of the partial capsid (281 bp) sequence of the identified NoV strains in Beijing, China.The diagram shows the maximum likelihood analysis of the partial capsid sequence (ORF2) of NoV strains (n?=?26, boldface) identified in stool samples from 26 outpatients presenting with diarrhea. Twenty-five (96.2%, 25/26) of 26 strains clustered with GII, in which 23 (88.5%, 23/26) clustered with the GII.4 genotype and the remaining one belonged to the GI.3 genotype. In total, 22 strains (84.6%, 22/26) clustered with GII.4 Sydney and displayed 100% amino acid sequence identity with GII.4 Sydney variant (Accession No. JX459908). The maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree was generated using the software program MEGA, version 5.1. A Kimura 2-parameter model was used for nucleotide substitution, and substitution rates were assumed to be gamma distributed with invariant sites (G+I). The final tree was optimized using the heuristic nearest-neighbor-interchange (NNI) method. The numbers on each branch indicate the bootstrap values. The reference strains of GI (GI.1?GI.8) and GII (GII.1?GII.17) are shown in italics and GenBank accession numbers are included. The clustering is based on the classification of Zheng et al. [24]."
