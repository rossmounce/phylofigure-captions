"pone.0021080.g004.png","Unrooted phylogeny of FEN based on Bayesian analysis of 37 sequences of 215 amino acid positions performed with PhyloBayes under the CAT60 model. Detailed parameters are given in the Materials and Methods section. The NCLDV sequences (red) and metagenomic sequences (black) emerge as a single group from within the eukaryotes (blue), with the exclusion of the Emiliana huxleyi virus. Archaeal sequences are in green. The indicated branch support values are posterior probabilities, and the bar represents 0.6 substitutions per site. Black sequences represent metagenomic sequences of unknown organismal origin."
