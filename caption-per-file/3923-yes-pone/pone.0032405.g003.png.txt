Bootscan and phylogenetic analyses of partial genomes from the Changchun strains. A: Identification of the recombinant sequences in the 5′-UTR region of the Changchun011 genome. The window size of 100 nucleotides slides in increments of 20 nucleotides at a time. B: The neighbor-joining tree was established from alignments of the entire 5′-UTR region for the seven Changchun strains. C: Bootscan analysis of a 3D region in the Changchun011 genome. The window size included 200 nucleotides slides in increments of 20 nucleotides at a time. D: The neighbor-joining tree was established from sequence alignments of the entire 3D region for the seven Changchun strains. The ▪ icon indicates the fatal cases; ▴ indicates the severe cases; • indicates the mild cases."
