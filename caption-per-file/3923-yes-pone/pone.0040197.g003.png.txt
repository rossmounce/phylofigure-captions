Relationships between LTR retrotransposons of Laccaria bicolor and Coprinopsis cinerea.This phylogenetic tree is based on reverse transcriptase (RT) and ribonuclease H (RH) amino-acid sequences of all the LTR retrotransposons identified by LTR_STRUC and after manual curation. In black: clade 1, in blue: clade 2. Gypsy elements are designated by blue font, Copia by black, LARD by magenta and ERV by orange."
