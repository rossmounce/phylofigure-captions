"pone.0016426.g001.png","MLST analysis reveals phylogenetic relationships between S. aureus nasal carriage and clinical strains. Bayesian phylogram indicating the evolutionary relationships of S. aureus strains analyzed in this study. Represented are 66 nasal carriage strains (strains colored in black) and 27 clinical strains (strains colored in red). Note that several clinical isolates cluster on the same genetic clade as major clinical strains. Numbers represent posterior probabilities and grey-filled circles represent nodes receiving 100% posterior probability support. Colored boxes are consistent with strain groupings in Figure 2 (below)."
