"pone.0063688.g004.png","Arthropod CSP phylogeny.Maximum likelihood tree constructed from representative arthropod CSP protein sequences. Species are referred to in three letter codes. Confidence values (1000 bootstraps) are indicated. Different CSP groups are highlighted in different colors. Typical CSPs are highlighted in green and CSPs with smaller binding pocket in purple. All 5-helical CSPs in arthropods form a single clade which is highlighted in grey. The ant-specific expansion is highlighted in yellow."
