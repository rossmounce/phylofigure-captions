"pone.0003569.g001.png","Phylogenetic reconstruction of the evolutionary history of CatSpers and CatSperβ in metazoans.The phylogenetic trees of the CatSper protein family (A) and the CatSperβ protein family (B) were constructed using the maximum likelihood approach [37]. Two putative primitive Ca2+ channels (MbrCaVS5 and NveCaVS17) were used as the outgroup for the CatSper family. Bootstrap values of more than 60 are shown at corresponding branches. The CatSper1-4 groups are indicated by rectangular bars, with invertebrate CatSpers filled with white and vertebrate CatSpers with gray. Note that protein sequences that failed in the chi-square test in Tree-Puzzle [69] or contained more than 15% gaps in the refined alignments were not subjected to phylogenetic analysis (Table S1).
