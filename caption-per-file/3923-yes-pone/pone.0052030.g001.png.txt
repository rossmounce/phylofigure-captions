Phylogenetic analysis and cis-acting regulatory elements in the promoter of OsMYB55.Per cent similarity to homologs in other species (A), an un-rooted phylogenetic tree was drawn using Tree View based on alignments by CLUSTALX. The amino acid sequences used in this analysis are translated from Oryza Sativa (Os05g0553400), Sorghum bicolor (242088749), Zea mays (226509454), Vitis vinifera (296081600), Populus trichocarpa (224092242), Malus x domestica (71041104), Dacus carota (134026414), Glycine max (255642827) and Arabidopsis thaliana (15242793). Potential cis-elements presented in the OsMYB55 promoter sequence (B), MeJA, cis-acting regulatory element involved in methyl jasmonate -responsiveness; HSE, cis-acting element involved in heat stress responsiveness; ABRE, cis-acting element involved in abscisic acid responsiveness. The numbers below the diagram indicate the position of each cis-element upstream of the ATGG initiation codons."
