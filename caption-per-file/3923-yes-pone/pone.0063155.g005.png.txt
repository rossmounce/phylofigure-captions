Putative highways of HGT.Circular representation of the phylogenetic tree based on the hybridization of 7,055 probes from the six fully sequenced strains. Putative horizontal gene transfer are represented using lines between tips of the tree. The lines are colored according to the significance level of having more gene sharing than expected by chance with green, blue and red for p-values superior to 0.99, 0.999 and 0.9999 respectively. Branches are colored according to the phylotype classification."
