"pone.0078813.g001.png","Schematic topologies of aDNA gene trees from 13 loci.Based on the phylogenetic relationship between brown bears and polar bears (see Figure S1), gene trees are classified into paraphyletic, multi-furcating, and monophyletic topologies. The paraphyletic topology includes eight out of 13 loci (ABCA1, SEL1L3, PREX2, SPTBN1, OSTA, CCDC90B, SPTA1, and IGSF22). Only one locus, AZIN1, supports the monophyletic topology. The remaining four loci (GGA3, ATP12A, TRAPPC10, and SCN5A) are assigned into the multi-furcating topology."
