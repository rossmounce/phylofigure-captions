"pone.0066840.g010.png","Phylogenetic tree.The phylogenetic tree shows the relationship between Candidatus Actinochlamydia clariae from African sharptooth catfish and selected members of other families within the order Chlamydiales. The best-fitting nucleotide substitution model was used during maximum likelihood analysis and the tree was bootstrapped (50 000 quartet puzzling steps) in TREE_PUZZLE. The scale bar shows the number of nucleotide substitutions as a proportion of branch lengths."
