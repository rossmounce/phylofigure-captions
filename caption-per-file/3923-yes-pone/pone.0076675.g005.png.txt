"pone.0076675.g005.png","Evolution of the interloop salt bridge near the active site.A phylogenetic analysis of bacterial lipolytic enzymes related to family XV and XIII on the separation of the N’ and N subfamilies. Sequences with solved crystal structures displaying the interloop salt bridge located in (i -2, i -4) from the catalytic Asp and His respectively are shown in bold. The corresponding ion pairs are shown right to the tree and annotated with a star and position relative to catalytic residues. Numbers show percentage identity compared with EstGtA2. Dashed lines indicate polarity reversals observed at the conserved interloop salt bridge position. The cap structure is indicated for X-ray resolved lipolytic enzymes. Sequences were assigned to N,N’and abH11 families (taking into account enzymes classification in Lipase Engineering Database). The phylogenetic and molecular evolutionary analyses were conducted using MEGA version 5. The evolutionary history was inferred using the neighbor-joining method and the evolutionary distances were computed using the Poisson correction and are in the same units of the number of amino acid substitutions per site."
