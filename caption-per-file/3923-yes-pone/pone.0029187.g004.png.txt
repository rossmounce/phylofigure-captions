"pone.0029187.g004.png","MES16K structure and phylogenetic tree analysis for the ccrC genes. The SCCmercury data for strain TW20 are from GenBank accession number FN433596. The GenBank accession number of MES16K is AB666466. Homologous regions are shaded. In A, for strain TW20, the ccrC-carrying unit was located within SCCmercury; the ccrC gene (marked in yellow) was split by the insertion of IS (IS200 family). For strain 16K, the ccrC-carrying unit was located within a mobile element structure MES16K, which was inserted into the orf (corresponding to SATW20_27600 of TW20) on the 16K genome, as shown in Fig. 2; the ccrC gene (marked in yellow) was intact. The attachment sequence (att) of MES16K showed no homology to that (att) of the orfX, SCCmecIII.1.1.1 or SCCmercury. Arrowheads PM1 and PM2 represent PCR targets for detection of SCCmercury of ST239/SCCmecIII.1.1.1 MRSA and MES16K of the Russian variant (strain 16K) by multiplex PCR (Fig. 3). In B, the ccrC gene sequence of strain 16K and that of strain TW20 (expected intact ccrC gene sequence, obtained by excluding the inserted IS200-family sequence) were analyzed for phylogenetic diversity, as described previously [36]. The ccrC gene of strain TW20 was a novel ccrC1 allele (named ccrC1 allele 10) and that of strain 16K was assigned as ccrC1 allele 3, unambiguously demonstrating evolutionary diversity between them; moreover, the ccrC1 gene of ST398 MRSA strain S0385 was also a novel allele (named ccrC1 allele 11)."
