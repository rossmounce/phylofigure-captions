TCS network of the 72 sampled haplotypes of Feirana quadranus based on ND2 gene sequences.Haplotypes (H1â€“H72) correspond to Table 1. The relative sizes of the circles in the network are proportional to the haplotype frequencies (n), and the black dots represent missing haplotypes. The phylogenetic clades and lineages were given in Figure 3."
