"pone.0064659.g007.png","Maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree of decaheme cytochrome protein sequences with high similarity to metagenomic sequences.(Mean log E value?=??13.3, mean % identity?=?70.5%, mean alignment length?=?47.7). The code in square brackets represents the number of similar sequences (superscript) from the four layers, with A-D corresponding to shallow-deep. Different sequences from the same genome are differentiated by the last 4 digits of the MD5 number in the M5nr database (http://tools.metagenomics.anl.gov/m5nr/m5nr.cgi). Sequences were aligned based on the ten CxxCH heme-binding domains. MtrA Opitutus has only 7?8 canonical heme-binding domains (eighth domain?=?TxxCH), and so this sequence was used as an outgroup."
