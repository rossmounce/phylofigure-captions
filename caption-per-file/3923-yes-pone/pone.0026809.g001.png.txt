Phylogram of selected arthropod amine receptor sequences. A phylogenetic analysis showing known invertebrate-type DA receptors and Î±-adrenergic-like OA receptors and their relationship to other DA, OA and TA receptors from Apis mellifera and Drosophila melanogaster. The honey bee rhodopsin protein is used as an outlier. Conserved regions of receptor protein sequences were aligned using ClustalW2 software (version 2.0.10) using the default settings (http://ww.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/clustalw2/). Phylograms were prepared as described in [30] by a 1000 trial N-J bootstrap analysis, and using ClustalX software (version 2.0). Resulting bootstrap scores are displayed on selected nodes as percentages values, if greater than 50%."
