Phylogeny of enzymes from the pathway of methanogenesis.A. representative enzymes from the C-1 branch. B. other representative enzymes. a. Formylmethanofuran-tetrahydromethanopterin formyltransferase (Ftr), b. N5N10-methenyl-tetrahydromethanopterin cyclohydrolase (Mch), c. F420-dependent N5N10-methylene-tetrahydromethanopterin dehydrogenase (Mtd), d. and F420-dependent N5N10-methylene- tetrahydromethanopterin reductase (Mer), e. methyltetrahydrosarcinapterin: CoM methyltransferase A (MtrA), f. MtrH. Protein sequences were aligned with ClustalX [43] and phylogenetic analysis was performed with MEGA [44] using the neighbor-joining algorithm. Bootstrap support was obtained from neighbor-joining (first value), maximum-parsimony (second value) and maximum-likelihood (third value) methods based on 1000 replicates. The accession number of each reference sequence is shown in table S2. Framed sequences refer to those involved in the methyl methanogenesis pathway. The bar represents 10% estimated sequence divergence."
