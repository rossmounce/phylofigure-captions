PtrMYB2 and PtrMYB21 are able to functionally complement the growth arrest and vessel wall-thickening defects in the Arabidopsis myb46 myb83 double mutant.(A) Phylogenetic relationship of Arabidopsis MYB46/MYB83 and their orthologs from poplar (Populus trichocarpa; PtrMYB2/3/20/21) and other plants, including Eucalyptus (Eucalyptus grandis; EgMYB2); Pine (Pinus taeda; PtMYB4), grapevine (Vitis vinifera; VvMYB46), alfalfa (Medicago truncatula; MtMYB46), soybean (Glycine max; GmMYB46), rice (Oryza sativa; OsMYB46), maize (Zea mays; ZmMYB46), sorghum (Sorghum bicolor; SbMYB46), barley (Hordeum vulgare; HvMYB46), and brachypodium (Brachypodium distachyon; BdMYB46). The phylogenetic tree was constructed with the neighbor-joining algorithm using PHYLIP and displayed using the TREEVIEW program. Bootstrap values are shown in percentages at the nodes. MYB58, MYB63 and their poplar homologs (PtrMYB28 and PtrMYB192) are included as the outgroup. (B) Complementation of myb46 myb83 by PtrMYB2 and PtrMYB21. Upper panel shows four-week-old seedlings of the Arabidopsis myb46 myb83 double mutant (arrow; higher magnification of myb46 myb83 in inset), the myb46 myb83 mutant expressing PtrMYB2 (+PtrMYB2), the myb46 myb83 mutant expressing PtrMYB21 (+PtrMYB21), and the wild type. The lower panel shows secondary wall thickening in leaf veins of corresponding plants displayed above. Note that the vein in the myb46 myb83 mutant has little secondary wall thickening, which is rescued by the expression of PtrMYB2 or PtrMYB21."
