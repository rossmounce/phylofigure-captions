Maximum likelihood (ML) phylogenetic reconstruction of the Tuberaceae phylogeny based on ITS, 28S rDNA, EF1?, and RPB2 gene regions.Thickened branches represent ML bootstrap support >70 and posterior probabilities of 100. ML bootstrap values above nodes are based on 1000 replicates. Posterior probabilities are presented below nodes. Thickened branches without numbers received maximum ML and Bayesian support values. Reconstructed ancestral host plant associations (based on maximum likelihood) are represented at internal nodes by circles; black for ancestors in symbiotic association with angiosperms, white for ancestors in symbiotic association with Pinaceae, and gray for ancestors in symbiotic association with angiosperms and Pinaceae. Nodes supported by transitions in spore ornamentation from alveolate-reticulate to spiny are shown with an asterisk *. Economically important species are denoted by the symbol $ after their name and geographic origin. The phylogeny is rooted with taxa from the Helvellaceae including species of epigeous Helvella and hypogeous Balsamia. Major lineages of Tuber and Tuberaceae are indicated to the right of the tree. The Tuberaceae form a monophyletic group, which is resolved as a sister group to a previously unrecognized Southern hemisphere lineage (/gymnohydnotrya). Type specimens are denoted by the superscripts: h - holotype, i -isotype, p -paratype."
