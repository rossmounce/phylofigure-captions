The gain/loss analysis of FBX genes during the evolution of 18 plant species. (A) The gain and loss of FBX genes in each species and species split nodes. The phylogeny of each species and the taxonomic group designations were adopted from the Angiosperm Phylogeny Website (http://www.mobot.org/MOBOT/research/APweb/). The heatmap color bars at each branch/node represent the predicted number of genes gained (right) or lost (left), respectively. The actual numbers of gains/losses are indicated below each bar. The full names of the species along with their abbreviations are as listed in Table 1. (B) Species-specific generation of FBX genes in each species."
