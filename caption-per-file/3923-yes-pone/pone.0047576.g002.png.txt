Neighbor-joining (NJ) phylogenetic tree and intron-exon structures of CsR2R3MYB family genes.The unrooted phylogenetic tree (the part of left side) from the R2R3MYB domain was depicted by the MEGA 4.0 program with the NJ method. The tree shows the 11 phylogenetic subgroups (S1–S11) with high bootstrap value. The bootstrap values lower than 50 are not shown in the phylogenetic tree. All of 55 gene’s intron-exon structures are described in the middle part. Exons and introns are indicated by green boxes and single lines, respectively. Introns phases 0, 1 and 2 are indicated by numbers 0, 1 and 2, respectively. The length of each CsR2R3MYB gene can be estimated using the scale at the bottom. The exon number and length of each gene are listed in the table at right."
