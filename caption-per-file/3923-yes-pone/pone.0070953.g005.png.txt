"pone.0070953.g005.png","Pseudobarbus lineage diversity.(a) Maximum Likelihood analysis of phylogenetic relationships among mitochondrial cyt b haplotypes identified in Pseudobarbus from the south-western CFR. Bayesian posterior probabilities are given on the branches. The numbers (1?47) represent unique haplotypes and the colours represent unique lineages, corresponding to distribution maps in Figure S2 in Appendix S2. Distribution ranges of these lineages are presented in Figure S2 in Appendix S2. River systems in which the lineages occur are given in parentheses. (b) TCS network of cyt b haplotypes (1?47) from individuals of Pseudobarbus from the south-western CFR. The sizes of circles are proportional to haplotype frequency, and the colours indicate the river system (s) where the haplotype occurred. Black dots represent missing haplotypes in the network. Each branch represents one mutation step."
