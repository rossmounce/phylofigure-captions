Chronogram of the maximum likelihood phylogeny of Heteroptera and outgroups generated using Penalized Likelihood. Approximate divergence dates and 95% confidence intervals of selected clades (A, B, C, D, E) are indicated along the x-axis. Average ages for F, G, H, K, L, M and N were: F,228.0 Mya; G,164.1 Mya; H, 186.2 Mya, K, 66.3 Mya; L,193.0 Mya; M, 192.2 Mya; N, 152.9 Mya. Bars in corresponding colours were represented the age ranges of the oldest fossils for the infraorders."
