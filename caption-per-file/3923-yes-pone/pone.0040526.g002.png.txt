Phylogenetic relationships among viruses explain the similarities in gene expression.(A) Neighbor-joining dendrogram constructed using the similarity matrix computed from the lists of differentially expressed genes. Bootstrap support values are reported next to each node. (B) Maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree constructed from the replicase genes of the seven RNA viruses included in the study. For CaLCuV, the Rep (replicase-associated protein) was used instead. The statistical quality of the different clusters was evaluated by bootstrap. Significance levels are shown next to each node."
