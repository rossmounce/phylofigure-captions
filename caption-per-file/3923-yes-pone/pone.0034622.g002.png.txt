Phylogenetic tree of OpaR and its orthologs. Protein sequences were derived from V. alginolyticus ZJ-51 [60], V. parahaemolyticus RIMD 2210633 [16], V. harveyi ATCC BAA-1116 [61], V. vulnificus YJ016 [62], V. tubiashii RE22 [63], V. anguillarum 775 [64], V. cholera N16961 [65], and V. fischeri MJ11 [66]. The a.a. sequences were aligned by the CLUSTALW [67] web server at http://align.genome.jp/. The aligned sequences were then used to construct an unrooted neighbor-joining tree using the MEGA version 5.0 [68] with a bootstrap iteration number of 1000. Shown on the branch points of phylogenic tree were the bootstrap values (%)."
