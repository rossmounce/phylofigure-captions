"pone.0005362.g002.png","Tracking the unambiguous amino acid replacements along the phylogeny of EG95 isoforms.Particular amino acid changes, and their positions, are indicated on each branch. The predicted secondary structure for each isoform is represented schematically to illustrate evolutionary convergence. Red bars are alpha-helix regions; blue arrows are conserved beta-sheets and green arrows are variant beta sheets."
