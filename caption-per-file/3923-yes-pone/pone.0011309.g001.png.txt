Sequence differences between eight S. cerevisiae strains, S. paradoxus and S. bayanus.A: Schematics of PDR5 gene regions; B: Amino acid difference for whole PDR5 sequence; C: Amino acid difference for transmembrane domain regions of PDR5 sequence. The topology information for the WT Pdr5p was downloaded from UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot database (http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P33302). PDR5 DNA sequences of eight strains of S. cerevisiae (DBVPG1788, DBVPG1853, K11, NCYC361, S288c, YJM789, YJM981 and YPS606) were downloaded from a recent study [41]. Only the DNA sequences without any frame-shift mutations were used in this study. DNA sequences of PDR5 gene in S. paradoxus and S. bayanus were downloaded from NCBI database. The phylogenetic tree of these species was adapted from Fitzpatrick et al. [60]. The data were analyzed by Matlab and the different color schemes represent levels of amino acid similarity."
