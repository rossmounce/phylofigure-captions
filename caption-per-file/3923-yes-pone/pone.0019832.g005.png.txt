"pone.0019832.g005.png","Classification of Fc-like CfERVs with Pol puteins. Upper panel left, rooted tree on the fish WDSV shows the relationship between aligned CfERVs and bootstrapped values (n = 1000). Upper panel right: alignment window where horizontal white bars indicate the presence of aligned viral sequence, larger squared ends represent open gaps, and vertical blue colors indicate the degree of similarity (i.e. light: high, dark: low). Lower panel: three different un-rooted phylograms with WDSV to approximate a root point (red square joint) and zoomed views over dense branches of the tree. A) genus-labeled phylogram, gamma-like and unclassified elements in green and yellow respectively. B) Age classification phylogram, youngest elements in light blue, ancient in dark, undated CfERVs in black. C) Score classification phylogram, highest scoring elements in bright red color. A color scale to measure the variation in tone is provided for both B) and C)."
