Phylogenetic tree of bacterial divisions retrieved from S. littoralis larval gut based on sequence similarity.The 16S rRNA gene sequence of the cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus PCC 6301 (NC_006576.1) and the Armatimonadetes Chthonomonas calidirosea T49 (AM749780.1) were used as the out groups. A detailed description of the phylotypes and accession numbers of the most closely related reference sequences can be found in Table S1. The accession number of the other reference sequences are: Enterococcus durans Ed-02 (HM130537.1), Lactobacillus brevis T9 (JQ301799.1), Staphylococcus aureus subsp. aureus JH1(CP000736.1), Micrococcus luteus NCTC2665 (CP001628.1), Corynebacterium diphtheriae 31A (CP003206.1), Burkholderia pseudomallei K96243 (NC_006350.1), Rhizobium etli CFN 42 (CP000133.1), Desulfobacterium autotrophicum HRM2 (CP001087.1). The two digit bootstrap number and the three decimal posterior probabilities are shown on major nodes. The bottom bar represents substitution rate per site."
