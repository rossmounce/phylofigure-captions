Phylogenies of Saccharomyces sensu stricto species reconstructed using only sites that contain RGC_CAM and RGC_non-CAM substitutions.Unrooted phylogenies of Saccharomyces sensu stricto species constructed using the 2,647 RGC_CAM sites (panel A) and the 100,887 RGC_non-CAM sites (B) using the parsimony optimality criterion. Values above internodes represent percentage bootstrap support, internode certainty (IC), and internode certainty all (ICA). The average Homoplasy Index per site, tree certainty (TC) and tree certainty all (TCA) are also shown for the two data matrices. Note that sites containing RGC_CAM substitutions have substantially higher incongruence and substantially lower homoplasy than RGC_non-CAM sites. Finally, note that tree lengths can also calculated from the data shown in Table 1. Because tree length  =  (n–m) 2*m, where m  =  homoplastic sites and n  =  total sites, for RGC_CAM sites we have m = 530 sites and n = 2,647 sites. Thus, the tree length for the RGC_CAM data matrix equals (2,647–530) 2*530 = 3,177."
