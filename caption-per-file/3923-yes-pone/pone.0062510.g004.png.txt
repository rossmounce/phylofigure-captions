"pone.0062510.g004.png","BUCKy tree.Primary concordance (“BUCKy”) tree constructed using Bayesian Concordance Analysis of RAxML bootstrap replicates for each of the 24 phylogenetic marker genes. Values at the nodes are concordance factors. The branches of phyla with at least 5 representatives are colored, other lineages are all drawn with black lines. This representation is a radial cladogram, in which branch length is not proportional to time, and some branches may be elongated so that the names of the taxa appear on the circumference of the circle. The original version of this figure is available in the Supporting Information: Figure S9."
