Phylogenetic trees showing examples of the four categories of evolutionary events.These trees show examples of all the gene evolutionary events observed in this study: A) Gene fusion event detected in Cryptococcus neoformans; this represents a unique fusion event which most likely happened before the diversification of unikonts. B) Gene fusion event detected in Methanobrevibacter smithii; this represents a unique fission event that probably occurred in the Eukaryotes superkingdom. C) Gene fusion detected in Caenorhabditis elegans; this represents a multiple gene event, including gene fusions and gene fissions. D) Gene fusion detected in Oryza Sativa; this was classified as a non-conclusive gene event, as there was not enough sequencing data to support any hypothesis regarding specific gene fusion or fission events. The colored dots along the tree branches represent the state of the protein in each lineage, based on BLAST analysis. Red: the protein pair is separate (two different proteins), Green: the protein pair is fused, Blue: only one part of the fused protein is conserved, either the first or the second member of the protein pair, Grey: Absence of either proteins, or not enough data to conclude the presence of the protein pair. The highlighted oval shape indicates the species in which the fusion protein was identified. For a full phylogenetic profile of every result in this study, please see Table S6."
