"pone.0013583.g004.png","Phylogenetic relationships of three different protein (NS1, NP1, VP1) sequences in the bocavirus genus.The phylogenetic tree was constructed from amino acid sequences using the MEGA 4.1 software (neighbor-joining method with 1,000 bootstrap replicates). PBoV1 and PBoV2 are labeled with black diamonds, 6V and 7V are labeled with black triangles, and Pbo-likeV is labeled with an open diamond. MVC: minute virus of canines; BPV: bovine parvovirus; HBoV: human bocavirus; Pbo-likeV: porcine boca-like virus."
