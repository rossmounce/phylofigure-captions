Population structure and distribution of regions of difference (RDs) among subpopulations. (A) Division of the 31 strains into subpopulations (groups) based on STRUCTURE analysis of multilocus sequence typing data. The 5 subpopulations (groups) are colour coded. Group numbering and strain details are shown above and below the population strip respectively. Each isolate has been allocated to a subpopulation. Imports from another subpopulation are shown in its respective subpopulation colour. Y-axis is the proportion of subpopulation allocation for a strain. (B) Distribution of RDs among the subpopulations (groups). On the left is a phylogeny of the 5 groups, based on neighbour joining tree of representative strains without imports from each group shown in (A). On the right is the plot of the distribution of RDs. The distribution was grouped into 11 patterns as shown at the top. Each square represents a RD present in greater than 75% of the strains in that group. Squares marked red were RDs associated with high pathogenicity strains as identified by cluster and statistical analysis."
