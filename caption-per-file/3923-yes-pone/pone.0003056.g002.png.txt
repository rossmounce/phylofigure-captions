"pone.0003056.g002.png","Microbial Diversity.Phylogeny of the 17 bacterial taxa identified in this study, based on a maximum likelihood algorithm. Colored boxes indicate the number of subjects who were positive for a given taxon by culture (gray) or PCR (blue) (some samples were polymicrobial). For most individual taxa, the larger of the two numbers in the corresponding gray or blue box represents the total number of positive subjects; for taxa where neither method detected all positive subjects, the total number is shown in the white box. A 99% sequence similarity cutoff threshold was used for phylotype assignment, which was based on 621 unambiguous nucleotide positions. Bergeyella sp. (bracketed and in gray type) is included as a reference species only and was not detected in the study population. A single fungal species, Candida albicans, was detected by culture in 1 subject and by PCR in 2 (data not shown). GenBank accession numbers of bacterial and fungal rDNA sequences from this study appear in Supporting Table S2."
