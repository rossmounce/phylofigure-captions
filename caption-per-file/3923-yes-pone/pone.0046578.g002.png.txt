"pone.0046578.g002.png","Bayesian phylogram of cytochrome-b sequence data (n = 140).Species names are based on museum and field records. Bolded species names are currently recognized by Simmons [13] and serve as the species representative (from GenBank [2], [3], [16] or from specimens sequenced herein). Black bolded branches are lineages that are ≥5.0% divergent and red bolded branches are lineages ≥2.0% divergent. Bolded numbers within species names indicate specimens that were originally identified as the named species, but were found to be independent lineages that are ≥5.0% divergent. The pound sign (#) indicates all specimens originally identified as M. nigricans. OW = Old World lineages of M. brandtii and M. gracilis. Kerivoula papillosa and M. latirostris are outgroup taxa but are not shown in the phylogram. Support for nodes are presented as Bayesian posterior probabilities ≥0.95 (*), maximum likelihood bootstrap pseudo-replicate values ≥75% (**), or support in both analyses (***). Additional specimen information is in Table S1."
