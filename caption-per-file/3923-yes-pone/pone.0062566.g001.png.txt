Phylogenetic relationships within Clermontia (24 taxa and 1 outgroup Cyanea) based on 27 morphological characters, scoring petaloid sepals as a single state of a single character.Numbers above branches indicate bootstrap support levels â‰¥ 20%. (A) Maximum-parsimony (MP) phylogeny based on unweighted characters. The tree shown is strict consensus of 4928 shortest trees. Superscript indicates presence of petaloid sepals. (B) MP phylogeny based on sequential reweighting of morphological characters; tree shown is strict consensus of 100 shortest trees."
