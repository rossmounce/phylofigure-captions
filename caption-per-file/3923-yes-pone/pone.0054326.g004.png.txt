"pone.0054326.g004.png","Neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree of the partial 16S rRNA genes from stratified Baltic Sea sediments.In the inverted circular tree with a stacked bar chart (sea phases), red bars indicate the abundance of a leaf (sequence) found in the Litorina Sea laminae (depths 330 and 422 cm), blue bars the abundance of a leaf found in the Late Litorina Sea laminae (depths 91 and 101 cm) and the black bars the abundance of a leaf found in the Early Litorina lamina (depth 534 cm). The leaves without bars are reference sequences obtained using the NAST tool. Reliable branches are shown in the bootstrap tree (Fig. S5). The clone sequences were assigned to phylum or class level (Proteobacteria) or to genus level (Pseudomonas) by the RDP classifier with an 80% threshold. The putative JS1 clones were assigned, based on the closest sequence matches, using the RDP seqmatch tool. Scale bar represents the genetic distance, i. e. the nucleotide substitutions per site."
