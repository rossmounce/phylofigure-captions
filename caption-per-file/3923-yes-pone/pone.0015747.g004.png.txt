Phylogenetic distribution of p120-family proteins, kaiso-family proteins, junctional proteins, and proteins collectively required for a functional wnt pathway. A filled box indicates the presence of an orthologue from the corresponding protein family. Color coding for the phylogenetic tree is as follows: pre-metazoan in green, metazoan in blue, bilateral metazoans in red."
