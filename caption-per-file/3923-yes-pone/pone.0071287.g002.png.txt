Comparison between genetic and morphological clustering.a) Topology of the phylogenetic tree inferred from average ATPS? genetic distances using maximum likelihood method. b) Morphological tree inferred from the three main morphological features (branch thickness, branch spacing and branch length to thickness ratio) using average linkage. Species codes represent the species names (Car - M. carmabi, For ? M. formosa, Dec ? M. decactis) followed by a sample number. Coloured ellipses indicate similar clades in both trees."
