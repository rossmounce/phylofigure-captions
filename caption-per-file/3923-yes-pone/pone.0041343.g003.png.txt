"pone.0041343.g003.png","Identification and attempted validation of BAY61-3606 targets.(a) TREEspot image representing the inhibitory activity of BAY61-3606. Kinases that are inhibited for ATP binding by BAY61-3606 are indicated by red dots on the phylogenetic tree of kinases. The size of the red dot corresponds to the amount of inhibition by 1 Î¼M BAY61-3606. The identity of the individual kinases can be found in Table S1. (b) Cell viability quantified by Syto60 after shRNA-mediated knockdown of the potential BAY61-3606 targets in DLD-1 (red) or DKs-8 (blue) cell lines. Relative cell viability is normalized to the parental cell lines infected with vector only. Error bars represent SEM for 2 independent experiments."
