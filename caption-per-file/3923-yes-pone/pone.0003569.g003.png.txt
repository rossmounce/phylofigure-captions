The metazoan phylogeny describing the presence or absence of CatSpers and CatSperÎ² in examined metazoan genomes.The phylogenetic branching patterns of metazoans (not proportional to the evolutionary rates) were extracted from the Tree of Life project (http://www.tolweb.org/tree/) as of July 30, 2008. The metazoan lineages known to contain the CatSper channel complex are indicated by boxes with a solid line and gray background, while those believed to lack the channel complex are marked by boxes with a broken line and white background. Two lineages (Porifera and cartilaginous fishes) are underlined since the results obtained from these lineages are based solely on survey genome or genomic traces rather than complete genome sequences. The availability of more metazoan genome sequences in the future will probably expand and/or refine the lineage branches shown here."
