"pone.0005758.g001.png","Phylogenetic tree of 16S rRNA from cyanobacteria.Unrooted ML phylogenetic trees inferred from small subunit (16S) rRNA that include (a) different cyanobacterial orders and (b) only saxitoxin-producing (STX+) and STX− strains of Anabaena circinalis. ML bootstrap values (when ≥50%) are indicated at the nodes. The branch lengths are proportional to the number of substitutions per site (see scales in the figure). The toxic and non-toxic strains are indicated by the plus sign (+) and minus sign (−), respectively."
