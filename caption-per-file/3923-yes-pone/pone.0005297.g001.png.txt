"pone.0005297.g001.png","The phylogenetic tree of chloroplast genomes for the 31 species.The tree topology in Fig. 3 of ref.[6] was used, and the branch lengths were estimated by the ML with the codon-substitution model [21], [22] (CODEML in PAML [19]). The root was arbitrarily placed between Gymnosperm and Angiosperm. Non-synonymous (dN) and synonymous (dS) distances of Poales from Musa were estimated by CODEML."
