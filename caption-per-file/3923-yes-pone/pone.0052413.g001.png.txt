"pone.0052413.g001.png","Phylogenetic depiction of the common-ancestry of invertebrate rhodopsins (InRHO) and melanopsin.The main opsin amino acid substitutions which are critical for the protein functional and structural innovations are color-coded. Maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian methods were used to build the phylogenetic tree and the support values of each method are shown for the main nodes (bootstrap and posterior probability, respectively). The grey amino acids are the maximum likelihood predicted motifs of the rhabdomeric photoreceptor ancestor."
