Alpha and beta diversity of pyrosequenced eukaryotic rRNA amplicons from five subseafloor sites representing various marine subsurface provinces.(a) Kingdom and phylum-level affiliation of eukaryotic rRNA sequences. Percentage of total reads is presented on the y-axis, samples were normalized to the number of sequences detected in the sample with the smallest number of sequences prior to comparison and UniFrac. (b) Hierarchical clustering of the eukaryotic rRNA dataset and phylogenetic distances between samples was calculated using weighted UniFrac. Bootstrap support values are shown on nodes. Green circles at the end of the branches are proportional to TOC values. See Table 1 for sample information."
