Maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree based on the 16S rRNA gene sequences showing the relationships of the studied cyanobacteria (in bold).Bootstrap test (1,000 resamplings) was performed and values >50% for ML and NJ analyses are shown over the nodes. Branch lengths are proportional to the number of substitutions per site (see scale bar). Taxon name in red or blue denotes STX or CYN producer strains, respectively."
