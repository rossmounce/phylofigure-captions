Phylogenetic analysis of Old World arenaviruses including Gbagroube and Menekre virus. Phylogenies were inferred by BEAST software based on nucleotide sequences of complete GPC and NP gene, and partial L gene. Posterior values are indicated on the branches. For GPC and NP genes, the phylogeny was verified by using PhyML software (trees not shown). Branches which are not or poorly supported by PhyML (bootstrap values 0.5. For clarity of presentation, some distal branches were collapsed. The LCM virus main clade includes strains CH-5692, CH-5871, Armstrong, WE, Traub, MX, Pasteur, UBC-aggressive, and Marseille 12. The origin of Lassa virus strains is indicated by a prefix: SL, Sierra Leone; LIB, Liberia; GUI, Guinea; IC, Ivory Coast; NIG, Nigeria. Lassa virus lineages are indicated by roman numerals. The complete list of taxa with GenBank accession numbers is provided in Table S1."
