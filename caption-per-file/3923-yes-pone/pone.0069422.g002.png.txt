"pone.0069422.g002.png","Phylogenetic relationships between the Ms5HTRs and other amine receptors.Ms5HTRs are indicated with bold text (A) Phylogenetic tree of all available serotonin, tyramine, octopamine and dopamine receptors from 7 species of insects. This figure is arbitrarily rooted on the 5-HT2 clade. Strongly supported clades for 5-HT1, 2, 7 Dopamine 1, 2, Octopamine A, B, and Tyramine are generated as shown. The newly characterized Ms5HT2R sequence is present in the 5-HT2 clade and Ms5HT7R sequence in the 5-HT7 clade. In this and all subsequent phylogenetic trees, the best Bayesian topology is shown with node support values listed in the order of Posterior probability values, Maximum Likelihood bootstrap support values for PhyML and Maximum Likelihood bootstrap support values for RAxML. Other values are replaced with symbols as shown in the figure. Vertical bars with labels denote the reconstructed clades. The scale bar represents the number of changes per site. (B) Phylogenetic analysis of serotonin receptors from insects (I) and vertebrates (V), with the 5-HT2 receptors excluded. The figure is arbitrarily rooted on the vertebrate 5-HT3 clade, but should be treated as unrooted. Note the reconstruction of the various named insect and vertebrate receptor sub-types."
