A cladogram of modern and ancient C.pygargus haplotypes obtained with TCS (v1.18) program. The size of the oval is proportional to the number of samples within each haplotype, each small circle on a branch indicates a mutation, including indels. Abbreviations: “DC” indicate Denisova Cave samples, “Alt” – samples from Altai; “Ns” – Novosibirsk region samples; “Ts” – Tian Shan samples; “Ja” – Yakutian samples; “dv” – Russian Far East samples (studied here); “SIB2” and Z70317 - Russian Far East samples [5]; “SIB1” – sample from Kurgan region [5]; “WD”, “XP”, “SP” – North Eastern China samples [7]; “C.och” – Korean samples (from GenBank). We took 12 Europen roe deer samples (empty ovals) representing all major branches of the phylogenetic tree constructed for the population of the European roe deer [26]. Color indicates the origin of samples."
