"pone.0002048.g003.png","Consensus phylogenetic tree of the mazG gene from phage isolates and bacteria.Bacterial and phage sequences as before (Figure 2) with Group 2 phages IO41, RS85, IO39, RS39, IO15, S-IO80, IO18, RS38, and IO17. Trees are unrooted and were generated from DNA codon alignments. Clade support values are shown at the nodes of the clades, only values below 0.95 are shown. Colourings as in Figure 2 with the addition of Group 2 shown in green."
