Maximum likelihood phylogram with aLRT branch-support values of the Stx2 “pan-genome” data among E. coli Stx2-bacteriophage and a bacteriophage from Shigella dysenteriae (Table 1).Labels represent the host-source of the bacteriophage as serotype followed by strain name. Red shading: Stx2-phage from O104:H4 outbreak isolates (light); O111:H- strain JB1-95 (dark). Purple shading: Stx2-phage from O157:H7 lineage I strains; related Stx2-bacteriophge; O145:H2 strain 4.0967. Green shading: Stx2-phage from O157:H7 lineage I/II strains; the sub-group of lineage I/II Stx2-phage most closely related to the O104:H4 isolate phage. Yellow shading: Stx2c-phage from O157:H7 lineage I/II strains and bacteriophage 2851 (light); O157:H7 lineage II strains (dark)."
