Maximum likelihood estimate of phylogenetic relationships in Tortricidae.Tree was obtained from 1000 GARLI searches under a GTR+gamma+I model for all nucleotides (unpartitioned). Bootstrap support values (742–901 pseudoreplicates) above branches for: nt123 (19 genes), nt123_partitioned (19 genes), degen1 (19 genes), nt123 (5 genes), degen1 (5 genes). “[-]” = node not present on best ML tree for that analysis. Nodes within Tortricidae are numbered (to the right of node) for purposes of discussion."
