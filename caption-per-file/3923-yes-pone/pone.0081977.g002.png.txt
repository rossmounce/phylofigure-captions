"pone.0081977.g002.png","Rooted maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees constructed from selected full-length sequences, intron 2 sequences and CYP21 gene sequences without intron 2 of the great ape CYP21 sequence dataset.The names of CYP21 sequences of HLA-homozygous cell lines available from public databases are represented at the human sequences. Bootstrap values are shown next to the corresponding nodes, but the values within human clades are not presented for clarity. The scale bar indicates genetic distance. (A) Rooted ML tree of great ape CYP21 full-length gene. (B) Rooted ML tree of great ape CYP21 intron 2. (C) Rooted ML tree of great ape CYP21 genes without intron 2."
