"pone.0012714.g007.png","Phylogenic tree and studies on adhesion and invasion levels of E. coli strains.Location of LF82 in the phylogenic tree based on analysis of concatenated FimH and OmpA amino acid sequences (A), adhesion (B) and invasion (C) abilities of LF82 and other sequenced B2 or non pathogenic strains to Intestine-407 cells. The percentage of replicate trees in which the associated taxa clustered together in the bootstrap test (500 replicates) are shown next to the branches. Cell-associated bacteria were quantified after centrifugation and a 3-h infection period. Invasion was determined after gentamicin treatment for an additional 1h. Each value is the mean Â± SEM of at least three separate experiments."
