Alpha-9 phylogenetic tree showing representative types and variant lineages. A phylogenetic tree was constructed using the MrBayes (v3.1.2) program [48] inferred from the global alignment of complete circular genome nucleotide sequences linearized at the first ATG of the E1 ORF. To root the tree, HPV34 and HPV73 prototype sequences (NCBI accession numbers NC_001587 and NC_006165, respectively) were set as the outgroup and are represented by grey broken lines. The Bayesian credibility values less than 100 were indicated on or near the branch nodes. The shaded areas represent groupings of lineages and sublineages of HPV16, HPV31, HPV33, HPV35, HPV52, HPV58 and HPV67. The length of broken and solid lines represent distance between clades, although the number of changes is different for these two lines, the scale is indicated in the upper left corner of the figure."
