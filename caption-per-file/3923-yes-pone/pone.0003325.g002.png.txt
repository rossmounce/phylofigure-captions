"pone.0003325.g002.png","The evolution of digit morphology.The forelimb and hind limbs of representative taxa illustrate the history of digit morphology in the lineages leading to the taxa compared in this study, the chicken (Gallus gallus), alligator (Alligator mississippiensis) and mouse (Mus musculus). The digits of early birds like Archaeopteryx, are specifically similar to digits 1, 2, and 3 of crocodilians, presenting 2,3 and 4 phalanges on each digit, respectively (node Ar). We arrive at the same conclusion if we compare Archaeopteryx to early dinosaurs, lizards, and early branches of amniotes (such as Captorhinus, Ophiacodon). No comparative morphological evidence has been presented for a 2,3,4 identification of wing digits. Molecular phylogenies confirm the relationships shown in this figure [3], [33]. Maximally parsimonious inference of morphological history is done following the method in [34]. The nodes of the tree are labeled for corresponding clades: A) Amniota R) Reptilia, D) Diapsida, Ar) Archosauria, T) Theropoda, B) Birds S) Synapsida Th) Therapsida. A geological time scale indicates the approximate time of lineage divergence."
