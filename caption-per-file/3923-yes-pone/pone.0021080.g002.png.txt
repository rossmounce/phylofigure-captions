Unrooted phylogeny of TFIIB based on Bayesian analysis of 30 sequences of 162 amino acid positions performed with PhyloBayes under the CAT60 model. Detailed parameters are given in the Materials and Methods section. This tree shows a polytomy in which the relationships among the the different eukaryotic groups and NCLDV lineages are not resolved at posterior probabilities 0.5. This lack of resolution beyond the eukaryote/prokaryote split is typical of the topologies recovered for this gene under the models that passed our tests. Archaeal sequences are shown in green, the black sequence represents a metagenomic sequence of unknown organismal origin. The indicated branch support values are posterior probabilities, and the bar represents 0.3 substitutions per site."
