"pone.0026800.g001.png","Broad phylogenetic distribution of LIV-1 ZIP metal ion transporters contrasts narrow distribution of prion genes in Chordata lineage. Numbers of LIV-1 ZIP and prion sequences in the selected organisms were extracted from gene data published by the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute (TreeFam, http://www.treefam.org) and by multiple alignments of ZIP and prion protein sequences. For each organism, the number of the subset of sequences containing a cysteine-flanked core (CFC) domain is indicated in brackets."
