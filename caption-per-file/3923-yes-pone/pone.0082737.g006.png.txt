An unrooted phylogenetic tree was constructed using the trout MS4A amino acid sequence (bold) and available published MS4A amino acid sequences from mammals and fish.The tree was constructed using an amino acid multiple alignment using the ClustalW algorithm and the neighbor joining method. Bootstrap values (1000 replicates) are shown above the branches."
