"pone.0025601.g001.png","Schematic consensus phylogeny of the East African cichlids based on mitochondrial and nuclear gene segments (after [1], [25], [36]). The haplochromines (indicated by grey branches) are a derived and species-rich clade. The males of most haplochromine species display anal fin egg-spots, just as exemplified here for Astatotilapia burtoni. A few ancestral species, such as Pseudocrenilabrus multicolor, do not have egg-spots. Note that A. burtoni belongs to a riverine clade and occurs within Lake Tanganyika and surrounding rivers."
