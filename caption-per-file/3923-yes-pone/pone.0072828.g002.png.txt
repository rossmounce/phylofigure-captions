Cluster analysis of Pulsed-field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE) ApaI macrorestriction fragments of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus ST398 isolates followed by multilocus sequence typing (MLST), staphylococcal protein A (spa), staphylococcal cassette chromosome (SCCmec), accessory gene regulator (agr) typing and year of isolation.For dendogram construction, optimization and band position tolerance were both set at 0.7%. The cut-off value to define the PFGE patterns was set at 80% similarity."
