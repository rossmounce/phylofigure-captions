Small subunit ribosomal RNA (SSU rRNA) maximum likelihood phylogeny (ML) of two Psammosa species in context of recently described biodiversity of perkinsids and ‘lower’ dinoflagellates.The tree was inferred using RAxML 7.2.8 under the GTR model with gamma correction from at total 1297 nucleotides. Numbers at nodes represent branching support. First number shows ML non-parametric bootstrap support as inferred in RAxML (500 replicates). Second number represents bayesian inference posterior probability, as calculated using Phylobayes 3.2 under the empirical admixture model C40 combined with LG exchange rate matrix. Only posterior probability higher than 0.94 and bootstrap support of 50 and more is shown. Branch lengths of ellobipsids (shaded clade) were reduced as indicated on figure. Dots by nodes point to alternative topologies of Psammosa spp. as tested by AU test (empty represent rejected and black not-rejected). Uncultured/environmental sequences are represented only by GenBank accession number. Accession numbers of sequences with known taxonomy are shown in brackets. See text for more details."
