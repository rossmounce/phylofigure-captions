Comparison of the phylogenies of AVRk1 and TE1a sequences.A. Tanglegram for AVRk1 (left) and TE1a (right) sequences, based on predicted ORFs from Bgh genome. Lines connecting sequences indicate associations. Bootstrap support (1,000 replicates) is shown below the branch if higher than 70%. B. One of the four potentially optimal reconciled trees between AVRk1 and TE1a trees. The two trees are superimposed. Hypothetical evolutionary events are represented as black circles for codivergence events, white squares for duplication events, white circles for gene losses and arrows for gene transfers."
