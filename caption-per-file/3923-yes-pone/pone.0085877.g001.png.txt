Phylogenetic analysis of Cladosporium fulvum PKS and NRPS enzymes.Alignments of (A) full-length protein sequences of non-reducing polyketide synthases (PKSs) and (B) A-domains of non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) were used to construct maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees. The third A domain of ClafuNps9 was not included because of poor alignment. CYCLO: cyclosporine synthetases; SID: siderophore synthetases; EAS: Euascomycete clade synthetases. Only bootstrap values over 70 are shown. C. fulvum secondary metabolism enzymes are indicated in bold. The chemical structures of secondary metabolites potentially produced by C. fulvum are shown. Accession numbers are given in Table S1 and Table S4 in File S1."
