"pone.0040292.g002.png","Characterization of Aspergillus nidulans GmcA sequence.A) Domain, conserved motif location and residue enrichments in A. nidulans GmcA sequence. Gray: Sequence comprising the SBD of GmcA as identified by homology modeling of the GmcA sequence on the PDB 3FIM structure (PerynAAO). Dark blue diamonds: Cysteine residues. Green diamonds: Histidine residues. PF00732 and PF05199: GMC N- & C-term Pfam motifs, respectively. Light blue: Prosite (PS) motifs and the βαβ dinucliotide binding motif. B) Inferred unrooted phylogenetic tree of 27 GMC sequences from the first clade of [23] plus the A. nidulans GmcA sequence. GMCs with predicted signal sequence are labeled with SS. Bootstrap support values calculated from 100 trees are indicated at relevant nodes."
