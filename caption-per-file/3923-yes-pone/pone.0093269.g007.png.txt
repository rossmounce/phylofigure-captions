"pone.0093269.g007.png","Open reading frame structure and phylogenetic analysis of the adenovirus genomes identified in this study.The ORF pattern of the full genomes grey (for all ORFs >100 amino acids in length), with the initial ATG in each ORF (vertical red bar) and all stop codons (vertical black bars) are indicated. For clarity the stop codon positions were not marked in the adenovirus genomes. Also shown are the maximum likelihood trees inferred using PhyML version 3.0 under the general-time reversible substitution model. Among-site heterogeneity was considered through a discrete-gamma distribution model, and the robustness of the phylogeny assessed through bootstrap analysis of 1000 pseudo-replicates. The trees are marked with green node circles indicating the bootstrap support, (small green circle at 70% support, larger green circle at 100% support, black nodes indicate support below 70%). The genomes identified in this study are marked in red."
