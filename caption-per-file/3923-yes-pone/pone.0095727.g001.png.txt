"pone.0095727.g001.png","Summary of phylogenetic relationships in the tribe Delphinieae (cf. [7]).The sampling ratio for each of the genera, subgenera, and subgroups from this tribe is shown (the size of each colored rectangle representing the approximate number of species in each). At the bottom right hand corner, the names of the species used for the characterization of Cyc-like genes are specified for each of the ten groups. Schematic shapes for the dorsal sepal and corolla are shown above the branches of the tree: the dorsal sepal can be spurred (sharp black shape) or hooded (round black shape); the corolla (in blue) can be composed of four petals (two spurred and two flat), two petals (both spurred), or a single spurred petal."
