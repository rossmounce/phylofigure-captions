"pone.0054360.g003.png","Complete mtDNA phylogenetic tree of subhaplogroup A8.The tree is rooted in haplogroup N. Mutations are scored relative to rCRS. Four additional complete genome sequences were taken from the literature listed in Table S1. The mutations are transitions, unless suffix (A, C, T or G) that represents the transversion is added. Insertions are marked by an ?ins? and deletions are marked by ?del? following the position of inserted or deleted nucleotide. Haplogroup names are in boldface. Haplotype names are in green. The mutations that are haplogroup diagnostic are listed below the haplogroup name. Branches consisting haplotypes identified in Slavic populations are highlighted in green."
