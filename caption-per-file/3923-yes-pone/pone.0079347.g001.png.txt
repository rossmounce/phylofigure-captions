"pone.0079347.g001.png","P. ramorum RXLR effector family with insertion/deletion of domains.Evolution in the domain structure of effectors is evident by comparing the phylogeny of the genes to their composition. A. The ancestral relationships among the genes inferred from a maximum likelihood tree of the targeting region (signal peptide through RXLR-DEER) with indels removed. Branch support is shown as a percentage of 500 bootstrap samples. The branch lengths are drawn to scale and measured in the number of substitutions per site. B. Schematic showing the aligned domain structure of the genes (not to scale). Gaps in the alignment are indicated using forward slashes. Colors of domains are: black – signal peptide, red – RXLR-DEER, and blue –WY-domain. WY-domains in lighter shade indicate low scoring matches to the HMM. *PrAvh198 was at the end of a scaffold and is missing the 3’ end of the gene."
