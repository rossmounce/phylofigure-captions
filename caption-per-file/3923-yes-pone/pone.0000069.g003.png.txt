Phylogenetic relationships among Type 2 aVDPVs at 6 locations along the genome.Phylogenetic trees 3A through 3F are maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees for 6 regions distributed along the polioviral genome, two in the 5′ non-coding region, 2 in the region encoding structural genes and 2 in the region encoding non-structural genes (R1–R6 in Fig. 1).The non-coding regions analyzed are R1, the 5′UTR encoding domains III to VI (Fig. 3A; nt 196 to nt 645), and R2, the 5′UTR hypervariable region (Fig. 3B: nt 646 to nt 712).The regions encoding structural genes analyzed are R3, the P1 region encoding all capsid proteins (Fig. 3C; nt 748 to nt 3384), and R4, VP1 (Fig. 3D; nt 2482 to nt 3384).The regions encoding nonstructural genes are R5, the RNA polymerase gene before the recombination point (Fig. 3E; nt 5986 to nt 6690), and R6, the RNA polymerase gene after the recombination point (Fig. 3F; nt 6700 to nt 7368).Nucleotide positions are given relative to Sabin 2 (Acc: X00595).Trees were prepared using the dnaml maximum likelihood application of the PHYLIP program.The transition:transversion ratio was set at 10, data was bootstrapped 100 times and the order of sequences for each bootstrap randomized 3 times. Trees A through E are rooted to Sabin 2, while tree F is rooted to Sabin 1(Acc: V01150).Branch lengths correspond to the number of times a given branch appears among all bootstrapped trees.All branches with bootstrap values The trees were visualized using the njplot program."
