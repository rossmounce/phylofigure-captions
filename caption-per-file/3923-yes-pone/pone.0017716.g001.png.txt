"pone.0017716.g001.png","Unrooted phylogenetic reconstruction of selected Acrocephalus species and two outgroups. The posterior probabilities and bootstrap values are shown for Bayesian, Maximum Likelihood and Neighbor Joining methods, respectively, for A. orinus and A. dumetorum clades. The Bayesian posterior probability of all interspecies comparisons is 0.99 or greater, except the branch between A. agricola and A. tangorum (0.77). The non species name labels are museum identifiers with R 77372, R 93929, 23115/15, 20991/22 and 31543/23 corresponding to the 5 control A. dumetorum specimens and 6629/1206 to the low confidence A. orinus that the phylogenetic analysis confirms as A. dumetorum (Table 2)."
