Detection of Atlantic flyway duck AIV PB2 gene sub-lineages in non-duck host species.The phylogenetic tree contains representative sequences from the Atlantic flyway duck AIVs for each of the 6 PB2 sub-lineages, with sub-lineages indicated on the right. The 5 sub-lineages (C-2 through C-5 and J-1) that contained genes detected from non-duck host species are displayed with black branches. The sub-lineage C1, which did not contain genes from non-duck host species, is displayed with grey branches. The neighbour-joining tree was constructed with MEGA 5 and support values based on 1000 bootstrap replicates are shown as percentages where ?70%. The scale bar indicates nucleotide substitutions per site."
