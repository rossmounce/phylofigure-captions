"pone.0087477.g005.png","Phylogenetic tree of Thinopyrum intermedium (?=?Ag. intermedium) and some representative HMW-GSs from Triticeae.This phylogenetic tree was constructed with Maximum Likelihood Estimation method based on the nucleotide sequences encoding signal peptide and N-terminal conserved region of HMW-GSs plus the next three repeat units, one dodecapeptide, one undecapeptide and one hexapeptide repeat. D-hordein from barley was used as outgroup. The species names of HMW-GS genes in this figure are consistent with their accession names in GenBank, so here we replaced Agropyron intermedium with Thinopyrum intermedium."
