Mean C conversion factors (Cconv) across 59 Panamanian rainforest tree species. Cconv averaged 47.35±0.33% (S.E.) ranging from 41.87±0.51% (S.E.) in Guazuma ulmifolia (GUAZUL), to 51.57±0.15% (S.E.) in Macrocnemum roseum (MACRGL). Cconv differed significantly among species (N = 193, F58,131 = 6.55, PK = 0.186, P = 0.803). Error bars represent ±1 standard error of the mean, and the tree represents phylogenetic relationships among species as per APG2. Species codes are defined in Table S1."
