"pone.0063356.g001.png","Growth capacities of Yarrowia strains on 13 hydrophobic substrates as a function of their phylogenetic position.Squares represent growth capacity on minimal and rich (YP) media supplemented with triglycerides in red, methylates in yellow, free fatty acids in green and alkanes in blue. The squares marked YP reflect the capacity to grow on the YP base used as a carbon source, in the presence of the corresponding HS. Half-colored squares indicate slow or weak growth. The absence of a square indicates an absence of growth on both YP and minimal media. The phylogenetic tree was constructed by the concatenation of seven markers (2204 amino acids) and its robustness was estimated with a bootstrap of 100 replicates."
