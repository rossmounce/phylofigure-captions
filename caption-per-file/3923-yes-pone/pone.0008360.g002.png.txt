"pone.0008360.g002.png","Example of plate design and interpretation of results for the genetic classification of F. tularensis strain LVS.A) The allelic state of each marker in the LVS strain is indicated in boldface. A colored well corresponds to a phylogenetically determining (canonical) marker for a specific genetic subclade. B) A phylogenetic tree is generated from hierarchical analysis of the typing results. Thick lines indicate the inferred evolutionary history of strain LVS. D = derived state, A = ancestral state."
