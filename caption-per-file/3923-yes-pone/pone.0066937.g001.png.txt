"pone.0066937.g001.png","Genome organization and phylogenetic analyses of the murine astrovirus.A) Genome organization of MuAstV. B) Phylogenetic analysis of the translated RdRP sequence of the murine astrovirus USA/BSRI/NSG/1 and representatives of the Astroviridae using the maximum likelihood method. C) Phylogenetic analysis of the RdRP nucleotide sequence of the murine astrovirus in laboratory mice from the USA and Japan, along with murine astrovirus in wild and laboratory mice from the Genbank database. Sequences from wild mice were labeled with squares; laboratory mice from USA with circles; laboratory mice from Japan with triangles; immunocompetent mice were labeled black and immunodeficient mice were labeled white. D) Comparison of nucleotide sequences of MuAstV in this study with published sequences in GenBank. For each sequence, the first row denotes nucleotides in which discrepancies were highlighted in black. The second row denotes amino acids in which discrepancies were highlighted in color with a note ? consensus amino acid was followed by the mutated amino acid and the position corresponded to the translated ORF1b RdRP gene."
