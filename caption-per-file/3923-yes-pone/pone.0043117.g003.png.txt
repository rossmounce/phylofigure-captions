"pone.0043117.g003.png","SSU rRNA phylogenetic positions of deep-sea Chytridiomycota (colored terminals) along with the closest known related SSU rRNA fungal sequences.Topology was built using MrBayes v.3.1.2 (Scale bar: 0.1 estimated substitutions per site, 3000000 generations sampled every 100 generations and an average standart deviation of split frequencies of 0.004140) from a ClustalW 2.1 alignment. The model GTR+I+G was designated by jModelTest 0.1. Node support values are given in the following order: Maximum Parsimony/Maximum Likelihood (both calculated with PAUP 4.0Î²10 version, 500 bootstraps)/MrBayes. Corallochytrium limacisporum (L42528), a putative choanoflagellate, was used as outgroup. Maunachytrium keaense (it is not part of PHYMYCO-DB) was also used to help build the tree. All sequences are listed with their GenBank accession numbers. The topologies were congruent apart from doted lines indicated in the figure. Thin lines show bootstrap values >50% and BPP >0.5 (MP/ML/MrBayes) and thick lines: bootstrap values >70% and BPP >0.7 (MP/ML/MrBayes). The sequences belonging to the Lobulomycetaceae family are indicated with their BLASTn percentage of maximum identity compared to the three deep-sea Chytridiomycota OTUs."
