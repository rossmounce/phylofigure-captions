Node support is indicated with MP, NJ and ML bootstrap values and Bayesian posterior probabilities (given above and below the branch, respectively). (b) The network with a 95% connection limit. Each circle represents a single haplotype and the circle size is scaled by the haplotype frequency. Filled black circles represent missing or unsampled haplotypes. The numbers in the network represent mutational steps between haplotypes."
