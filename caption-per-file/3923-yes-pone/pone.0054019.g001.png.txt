"pone.0054019.g001.png","Amino acid sequence and phylogenic tree of CPC-like R3 MYB proteins.(A) Sequence alignment of SlTRY (Solyc01g095640.1.1), TRY (AC007288) and CPC (FJ268773). Shaded letters indicate identical residues. R3 MYB domains are indicated by a line above the sequences. (B) Phylogenic tree based on deduced amino acid sequences of CPC-like R3 MYB proteins [SlTRY, TRY, CPC, ETC1 (NM100020), ETC2 (FJ972652), ETC3/CPL3 (AB264292), TCL1 (FJ972675), TCL2/CPL4 (FJ972681), Os1g43180 and Os1g43230] were aligned with a multiple alignment program (Genetyx ver. 16.0.2 software, Genetyx, Tokyo, Japan), and a dendrogram was created using clustering with the Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic Mean (UPGMA). Branch length indicates relative evolutionary distances. Numbers above branches are genetic distances based on 10,000 bootstrap replicates. Distances are shown as the p-distance."
