Phylogenetic tree view of MMD strains and amended MMD strains based on 16S genes.This image displays a phylogenetic tree based on 16S data for all 21 strains in the MMD, and also the 4 strains used as replacements in the amended MMD (D. geothermalis, Helicobacter hepaticus, Neisseria gonorrheae and Escherichia fergusonii). The shaded regions indicate the genera containing the amended strains (yellow: Escherichia, blue: Neisseria, red: Helicobacter, brown: Streptococcus and green: Deinococcus)."
