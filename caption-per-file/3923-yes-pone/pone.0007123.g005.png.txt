"pone.0007123.g005.png","Majority-rule consensus phylogenetic tree of representative sequences of single-domain TFPs computed by Bayesian inference using MrBayes.Numbers indicate the clade credibility (posterior probability) values; only posterior probabilities grater than 0.50 are shown. The sequence of the TFP domain of the Type II activin receptor was used to root the tree, but was removed from the figure. See Table S3 for the identity of the sequences in each grouping."
