"pone.0084714.g002.png","The phylogenetic relationships and divergence times [5] (indicated by red lines) across modern human, Neanderthal and Denisovan are highlighted.Varying functional and non-functional ORs between each species are shown along each lineage. Losses at identical positions (red ‘X’) and different positions (black ‘X’) are displayed. ORs for which the ancestral state is inferred are displayed at the root of the tree, with ancestral functional and non-functional gene names colored green and blue, respectively. Changes that have happened along the modern human lineage leading to functional and non-functional variants, for which a different functional/non-functional state exists in the other hominin species, are highlighted. The number of sequenced genomes are displayed. The three columns of OR genes along the modern human lineage represent the ancestral genes, Neanderthal gene losses and Denisovan gene losses."
