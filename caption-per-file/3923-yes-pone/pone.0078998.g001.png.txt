Distribution of thermopsin homologues amongst archaea with completely sequenced genomes.The phylogenetic tree is based on the classification from the NCBI Taxonomy database. Tips are annotated with coloured bricks as follows: yellow, completely sequenced genome; orange, hyperthermophilic; red, acidiophilic; black, presence of a thermopsin homologue. The number of black bricks indicates the number of thermopsin homologues."
