A phylogenetic tree showing the relationship of C. bombi isolates.The partial sequences of 18 S ribosomal RNA of C. bombi from Apis cerana collected from different geographic locations of China and from bumble bee species retrieved from GenBank were aligned using ClustalW. The tree was built using the Neighbor-Joining method. The sequence of Trypanosoma brucei was used as an outgroup to root the tree. Numbers at each node represent bootstrap values as percentages of 500 and only bootstrap values greater than 50% are shown."
