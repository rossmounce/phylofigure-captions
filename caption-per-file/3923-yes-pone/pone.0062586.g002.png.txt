"pone.0062586.g002.png","Bayesian phylogeny of Lucisporidia inferred from concatenated alignments of SSU rRNA and EF-1? genes, based on 41 sequences and 1705 positions, with Ceratiomyxa fruticulosa as outgroup.Clades are highlighted as in Fig. 1. Bayesian posterior probabilities (BPP)/ML bootstrap replicates (MLB) are shown for each branch; a dot on the line indicates maximum support in both analyses. In Trichiida, classical families (according to [12]) are indicated by an ellipse with the initials (Arc?=?Arcyriidae; Dia?=?Dianemidae; Tri?=?Trichiidae). The scale bar indicates the fraction of substitutions per site."
