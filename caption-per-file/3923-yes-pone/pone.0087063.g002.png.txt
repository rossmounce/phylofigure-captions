Phylogenetic analysis of LipM and LplA.Maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree including 131 LipM and LplA sequences from archaea, LplA sequences from major eukaryotic species (S. cerevisiae, D. melanogaster, M. musculus and H. sapiens) and LplA and LipM sequences from eubacteria representing Actinobacteria (S. coelicolor), Bacteroidetes (B. thetaiotaomicron), Firmicutes (B. subtilis and S. aureus) and Proteobacteria (E. coli and B. pseudomallei). Putative cases of horizontal gene transfer are indicated (asterisk) and major phylogenetic clades are highlighted: archaeal LplA (Clade I - orange; Clade II - green), LipM (red), and eukaryotic and eubacterial LplA (blue). The full phylogenetic tree including species names and bootstrap values is provided Figure S2."
