"pone.0089910.g002.png","Phylogenetic trees of LRRTM and ?-catenin proteins in selected vertebrates.(A) A LRRTM family tree was generated using the alignment shown in Fig. S1 and the maximum likelihood method. A tunicate LRR-domain protein CiSlit2 (one of the best BLAST hits shown in Table S4) is used to root the tree. Notice the absence of XtLRRTM2 and the divergence of XtLRRTM3 from the other vertebrate LRRTM3s. Numbers at each branch point represent bootstrap support for that branch. Bootstrap values of short terminal branches (all >90%) are omitted for clarity. The branch lengths are proportional to the expected proportion of amino acid sequence divergence (?=?number of residue substitution) between groups. (B) A maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree of ?-catenin proteins. Invertebrate (fruit fly, sea squirt, and lancelet) CTNNAs are included as outgroup. Note that the CTNNA3 clade has diverged more rapidly than the CTNNA1 and CTNNA2 clades during vertebrate evolution. Bf?=?Branchiostoma floridae (lancelet), Ci?=?Ciona intestinalis (sea squirt), Cm?=?Callorhinchus milii (elephant shark), Dm?=?Drosophilia melanogaster (fruit fly), Dr?=?Danio rerio (zebrafish), Gg?=?Gallus gallus (chicken), Hs?=?Homo sapiens, Lc?=?Latimeria chalumnae (coelacanth), Lo?=?Lepisosteus oculatus (spotted gar), Pm?=?Petromyzon marinus (sea lamprey), Xt?=?Xenopus tropicalis (African clawed frog)."
