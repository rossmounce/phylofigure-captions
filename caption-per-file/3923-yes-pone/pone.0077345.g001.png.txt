Neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree of AsegORs with functionally identified PR sequences in Lepidoptera.The tree was rooted with Orco lineage in Lepidoptera. Percentage bootstrap support (1000 replicates) values over 50 are shown at corresponding nodes. AsegORs and AsegOR\Orco are indicated with arrowheads. The nonsynonymous (dN) to synonymous (dS) substitution rate (ω) was labelled in the tree. Cluster II, III and IV have a uniform ω rate for all branches, as labelled at the right side, whereas Cluster I has various ω rate for all branches within the lineage, as labelled on the left on each branch. Genbank accession numbers of the protein sequences used in this phylogenetic tree were concluded in Table S2."
