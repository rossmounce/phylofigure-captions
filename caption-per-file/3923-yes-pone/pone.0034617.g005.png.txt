"pone.0034617.g005.png","The S. raphanus putative carbonic anhydrase. (A) The sponge putative carbonic anhydrase (CA_SYCON) is aligned with the highly related sequences from the demosponge S. domuncula, the silicase (SIA_SUBDO; DD298191), and the carbonic anhydrases from the scleractinian Acropora millepora (CAr1_ACRMIL; ACJ64662.1), and the stony coral Stylophora pistillata (CAa_STYPI; ACA53457.1, EU159467.1), as well as with the human carbonic anhydrase 2 (CA II) (CAHB_HUMAN; O75493). The indicative sites/regions within the Sycon polypeptide are marked, the carbonic anhydrase alpha (vertebrate-like) group stretch (−CA−), including the His residues, functioning as Zn-binding sites, the hydrophobic parts (+hydb+), as well as the signal peptide (:signal:). Residues conserved (identical or similar) in all sequences are shown in white on black; those which share similarity to at least four residues are in black on grey. (B) Radial phylogenetic tree, including the mentioned sequences, together with human carbonic anhydrases of the following isoforms: I (CA-I) (CAH1_HUMAN; P00915); II (CA-II) (CAH2_HUMAN; P00918); III (CA-III) (CAH3_HUMAN; P07451); IV (CAIV_HUMAN; AAA35625.1); IV (CA-IV) (CAH4_HUMAN; P22748); VA (CAH5_HUMAN; P35218); VB (CA5B_HUMAN; CA5B_HUMAN); VI (CA-VI) (CAH6_HUMAN; P23280); VII (CA-VII) (CAH7_HUMAN; P43166); VIII (CA-VIII) (CAH8_HUMAN; P35219); IX (CA-IX) (CAH9_HUMAN; Q16790); 10 (CA-RP X) (CAHA_HUMAN; Q9NS85); XII (CA-XII) (CAHC_HUMAN; O43570); XIV (CA-XIV) (CAHE_HUMAN; Q9ULX7). In addition, the coral sequence from Acropora millepora (CAr2_ACRMIL; ACJ64663.1), as well as the ones from the sea anemone Nematostella vectensis (CAr_NEMVE; XP_001627923.1), the tunicate Ciona intestinalis (CA14_CIONA; XP_002123314.1); the lancelet Branchiostoma floridae (CAr_BRANFLO; XP_002601262.1), the shark Squalus acanthias (CA4_SQUAAC; AAZ03744.1); the fish Oreochromis niloticus (CA4_ORENI; XP_003456174.1), together with the insect enzyme from D. melanogaster (CAr_DROME; NP_572407.3) are included."
