"pone.0020453.g002.png","Maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree based on aligned partial amino acid sequences of the methyl coenzyme M reductase gene (mcrA). Amino acid composition was deduced from DNA sequences and the tree was calculated with RAxML 7.04. Bootstrap values above 50% (out of a 100 trials) are displayed next to the nodes. Shaded clusters with diagonal lines contain sequences that were detected in the soil samples."
