Taxonomic assignment and abundance of archaeal communities in ATII, DD, CD and BI sediment samples.Maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree showing the taxonomic diversity and relative abundance of archaeal OTUs in all sediment samples. Bootstrap support values greater than 50% are indicated by the size of the circle on each branch. The taxonomically assigned OTUs are represented in ST-1."
