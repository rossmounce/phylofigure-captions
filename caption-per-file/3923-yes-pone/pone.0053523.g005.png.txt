Phylogenetic relationship of Caf4 and Mdv1 in representative fungi.The amino acid sequences of paralogs from fully sequenced fungal genomes were aligned using ClustalW2 and a phylogenetic tree was constructed using the maximum-likelihood method. Bootstrap values above 50 are shown at the nodes of the branches. Branch lengths are proportional to the number of amino acid substitutions per site. The Caf4 and Mdv1 clades are marked by vertical lines. Scale bar: 0.1 substitution per site in the protein."
