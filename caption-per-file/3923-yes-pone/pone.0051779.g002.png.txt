"pone.0051779.g002.png","Nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences and phylogenetic analysis of oral disk-specific protein (PregOBP56a).A, cDNA and deduced amino acid sequences of an oral disk-specific protein. A signal peptide is shown in italic. N-terminal amino acid sequence determined by Edman degradation is underlined. Arrowheads show 6 cysteine residues, which are hallmarks of insect classic OBPs. The three arrows indicate annealing sites of a degenerate (EEQKAKV-1) and two gene-specific (PregOBP56a-1 and PregOBP56a-2) primers, B, Phylogenetic tree of odorant-binding protein 56a like-protein sequences. Phormia regina odorant-binding protein 56a is shown in bold. Accession numbers of each protein are given in the parenthesis. Bootstrap values were determined from 1,000 replications. Bar indicates 5% divergence."
