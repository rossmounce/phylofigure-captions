Inferred phylogenetic relationship among the Hymenoptera species. The analyses were conducted using maximum parsimony (MP), maximum likelihood (ML) and neighbour joining (NJ) of amino acid sequences of 13 protein-coding genes, using Triatoma dimidiata as outgroup. The numbers along branches indicate bootstrap values resulting from different analyses in the order: MP/ML/NJ."
