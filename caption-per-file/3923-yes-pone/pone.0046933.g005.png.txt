"pone.0046933.g005.png","The ptp gene is present in all Alphabaculovirus group I NPVs.Bayesian phylogeny of baculoviruses based on the lef-8 gene. GenBank accession numbers are given in Table S3. Numbers in bold indicate maximum likelihood bootstrap values based on 100 replicates, while plain numbers depict Bayesian posterior probabilities. Only values ?50 are indicated for both analyses. The bar at the bottom indicates a branch length of 10% distance. Baculoviruses possessing a ptp gene are marked by a black dot, while baculoviruses possessing a ptp2 gene are marked by a black diamond."
