"pone.0086339.g006.png","Figure 6. Phylogenetic relationships among pipid AMPs (exon 2).Phylogenetic relationships as inferred by Bayesian analysis of a data set consisting of exon 2 of amphibian cck genes and AMP genes in X. laevis and S. tropicalis, aligned with the corresponding repeat sections of the hymenochirin precursor proteins. Repeat numbers correspond to those in Figure 2. The depicted tree represents the Bayesian consensus phylogram rooted with cck genes. Branches are shown in bold if Bayesian posterior probability is above 0.95 and RAxML bootstrap is more than 75%."
