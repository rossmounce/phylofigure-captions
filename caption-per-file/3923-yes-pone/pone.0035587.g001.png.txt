Maximum-likelihood phylogenetic trees of DOBV showing the phylogenetic placement of GRW/Aa.The trees were constructed with TREE-PUZZLE software (Tamura-Nei evolutionary model) and are based on (A) complete S-segment ORF, (B) partial S-segment (559 nt, positions 377 to 938), (C) complete M- and (D) complete L-segment ORF sequences. Values above the branches represent PUZZLE support values, while values below the branches are bootstrap values of the corresponding maximum likelihood trees calculated with the MEGA5 software from 1000 bootstrap pseudoreplicates. Only values >70% (considered significant) are shown. Different DOBV clades are indicated by gray boxes. GRW/Aa positions in the tree are designated with an arrow. H169 patient-derived sequence is designated with a star. For accession numbers, see the materials and methods. DOBV, Dobrava-Belgrade virus; HTNV, Hantaan virus; SEOV, Seoul virus; THAIV, Thailand virus."
