Gene expression and demethylation correlation.(a) Shows the gene expression correlation p-value matrix for the coexpression for each gene pair across all tumors. This comparison shows the correlation of each gene pair in 49 head and neck tumors. (b) Gene pair expression p-value correlation matrix for 80 NSCLC. Of note C19ORF28 is not tiled on this array platform. (c) Analysis of promoter regions for the genes. Shown is a phylogram of our promoters of interest based on ClustalW analysis after multiple sequence alignment. The region of significant homology is shown after sequence alignment and E statistics from EMBL-EBI's PromoterWise comparison. (d) Promoter hypomethylation (QUMSP) correlation p-value matrix for HNSCC (25 tumors). (e) Promoter hypomethylation (QUMSP) correlation p-value matrix for NSCLC (13 tumors)."
