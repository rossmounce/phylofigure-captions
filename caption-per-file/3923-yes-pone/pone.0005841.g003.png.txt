"pone.0005841.g003.png","Distance phylogram from nucleotide sequence alignment of partial rrs-rrl IGS of B. garinii variants of diverse geographical and biological origin.The names of the representative samples are used for taxa designation in the tree, with the corresponding variant number, according to the list in Table 1, indicated in parenthesis. Bootstrap values for nodes with at least 70% support by neighbor-joining distance (1,000 replicates; number above the line) and/or maximum-likelihood (100 replicates; first number below the line) and maximum parsimony (1,000 replicates; second number below the line) criteria are shown. The tree is based on observed divergence option of distance method in PHYLO_WIN. A maximum-likelihood reconstruction applied transitions/transversions ratio of 2.517, which was estimated from the sequence alignment. B. garinii variants found associated with I. uriae ticks are shown in bold italics, including two variants (boxed) found in both I. uriae and I. ricinus ticks. The variants found both in the I. ricinus ticks and in the patients with Lyme borreliosis are underlined. Six putative phylogenetic clusters of B. garinii genetic variants are indicated. Bar provides the scale for nucleotide distance."
