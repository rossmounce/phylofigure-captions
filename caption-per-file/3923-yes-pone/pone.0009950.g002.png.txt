Phylogenetic reconstructions.A. Maximum-parsimony phylogram with the genetic differences of the specimens and the contents of the haplotypes. Haplotypes were named after their species, or in the case of several species per haplotype, with a letter. Species names are followed by their Queensland Museum species number, and the QM-collection number (Gxxxxxx). Numbers above the branches indicate total differences (in substitutions). B. Bayesian inference phylogram on the haplotype relationships. Haplotype names refer to figure A. The numbers above the branches are posterior probabilities. Black bars indicate amino acid changes."
