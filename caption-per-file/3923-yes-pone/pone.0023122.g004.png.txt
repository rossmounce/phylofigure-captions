Degenerate DNA fragment of putative Ant4 gene in the syntenic region of chicken genome. (A) The syntenic region that includes Ant4 in the human, anole lizard and chicken genomes. The schematic diagram shows Ant4 (red boxes) with chromosomal location flanked by neighboring genes (blue boxes). Translated amino acid sequence of degenerate DNA regions of the putative Ant4 gene loci in the chicken genome was aligned with amino acid sequence of Ant4 of human and anole lizard. The asterisk in the chicken sequence is a stop codon; additional inactivating mutations include a 2-bp frameshift between nucleotide that would encode the D and K at the end of the chicken sequence and a stop codon immediately after the K. (B) Vertebrate phylogeny showing approximate divergence times (in millions of years before present) and the expected changes in Ï‰ (see text for definition) for the early and late inactivation models. (C) Phylogeny with branch lengths reflecting numbers of synonymous and non-synonymous substitutions. The light gray lines are included to make it easier to identify the taxon associated with each terminal, they have no biological significance."
