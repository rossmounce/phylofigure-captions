"pone.0096201.g001.png","Phylogenetic tree analysis of the pol region of HIV-1 “pure subtype” samples from Cape Verde.The phylogenetic inferences were performed by the Neighbor-Joining algorithm under the Kimura-2 parameter nucleotide substitution model using the MEGA v5.0 package. The scale represents the number of substitutions per site. Cape Verde and reference sequences are represented, respectively as black and white circles."
