"pone.0068005.g005.png","Phylogenetic trees for the Myriapoda and Ecdysozoa based on mitochondrial protein-coding genes.The following phylogenies were reconstructed using maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference of amino acid sequences. The ML trees were obtained using RAxML with 1000 random addition searches followed by 1000 boostrap replicates. The BI trees were obtained from two phylobayes runs consisting of 10000 cycles. The first 2000 cycles were discarded as burn-in. A) Myriapod ML tree, B) myriapod BI tree, C) ecdysozoan ML tree, and D) ecdysozoan BI tree. In the myriapod trees, millipedes taxa are colored green, symphylans are blue, and centipedes are red. In the ecdysozoan trees, outgroup taxa (non-arthropods) are colored black, myriapods are green, chelicerates are red, ?crustaceans? and non-insect hexapods are blue, and insects are yellow."
