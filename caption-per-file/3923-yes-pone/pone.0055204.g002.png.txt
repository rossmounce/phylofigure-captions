Neighbor joining phylogenetic tree generated using nucleotide sequences of the HPV-16 L2 gene.Study sequences are labeled in black. Others are standard sequences, including: AY686580, FJ006723 (China, Xinjiang), AY686581, EU118173, AF534061, U89348, AF536179, AF472508, AF536180, AF472509, and AY686579. Phylogenetic trees were constructed by the Neighbor-Joining method and the Kimura 2-Parameter model by MEGA package."
