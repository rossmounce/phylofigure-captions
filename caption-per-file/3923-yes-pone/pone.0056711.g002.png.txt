"pone.0056711.g002.png","Dendrogram based on 176 complete genomic sequences of HBV with genotypes Aâ€“J.The phylogenetic tree was constructed using the UPGMA method. The genotypes are marked by the letters A through J. Each sequence is identified by the GeneBank accession number, followed by the genotype/subgenotype and the country of origin of the isolates. HBV genomes containing three, two, and four CpG islands are shown in blue, red, and green, respectively."
