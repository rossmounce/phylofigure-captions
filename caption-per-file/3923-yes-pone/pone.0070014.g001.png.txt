Phylogenetic relationships among members of Glycoside Hydrolase Family 10.The phylogenetic tree was generated using the amino acid sequences from bacterial, fungal and uncultured microorganisms GH10 family members and one bacterial GH11 member (root). This tree was constructed using MEGA 4.0 software by the Neighbour Joining (NJ) method. The Bootstrap values (n = 1000 replicates) are indicated as percentage at the node of phylogenetic tree."
