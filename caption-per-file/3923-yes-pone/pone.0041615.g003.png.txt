"pone.0041615.g003.png","Phylograms of the consensus BI tree for the matrix of LEE T3SS genes.All diagrams are presented with long branches truncated (//) and the branch length indicated above. The subtree in the box represents BI branching on a different scale from the larger tree. Taxa are colored based upon the tRNA insertion point with selC in red, pheV in blue, pheU in green, and black for all other insertion points. Clades are indicated by large Roman numerals above calculated level of genetic diversity (Î¸) for all the members of the clade. The BI tree is midpoint rooted with posterior probability values represented as a percentage at branch points. ML analysis yielded the same branching (although differential branch lengths) and ML percentage bootstrap values are presented in parentheses () when this value differed from the percent posterior probability. Taxa enclosed by braces had identical sequences to the adjacent taxa and were therefore removed from the phylogenetic analysis."
