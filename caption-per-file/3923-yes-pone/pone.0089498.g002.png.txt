Distribution of pollen limitation across the phylogeny of plants in the Atlantic forest of Brazil.Occurrence of pollen limitation for the 132 species represented on the phylogeny obtained from the angiosperm APGIII [46] consensus tree (R20091110) in Phylomatic [47]. Pollen limitation was interpreted as significant if the effect size (d) was higher than zero and 95% confidence interval (CI) did not overlapped zero (black circles). Effect size (d) equal or lower than zero or 95% confidence interval (95% CI) that overlapped zero mean no pollen limitation (white circles)."
