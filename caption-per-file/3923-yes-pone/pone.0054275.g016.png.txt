"pone.0054275.g016.png","Strict consensus of 8 most parsimonious cladograms of 638 steps, showing the phylogenetic relationships of Maledictosuchus riclaensis gen. et sp. nov. within Metriorhynchidae when all characters are unordered.Ensemble consistency index, CI = 0.497; ensemble retention index, RI = 0.857; rescaled consistency index, RC = 0.426. Numbers over lines represent Bremer support values. Numbers under lines represent bootstrap values (only values over 50% represented). The topology is identical to that of Young et al.[43]. Maledictosuchus riclaensis gen. et sp. nov. is recovered in a large politomy at the base of the tribe Rhacheosaurini."
