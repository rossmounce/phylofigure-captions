"pone.0062318.g002.png","Phylogenetic tree of HBoV sequences.Nine samples with real-time PCR cycle threshold (Ct) value below 24 were chosen for genome sequencing. The nucleotide sequence of HBoV for each sample was PCR amplified, sequenced and analyzed. The phylogenetic tree of HBoV sequences was constructed using Neighbor-joining method by MEGA (5.0 version) software. The bootstrap percentages are given at the node of each branch (1000 replicates). Sequences of 6 different HBoV1 subtype, 3 HBoV2 subtype, 3 HBoV3 subtype, 2 HBoV4 subtype were downloaded from Genbank and used as reference viruses. All the isolates sequenced in this study are indicated by dark circles. The dark triangles represent FZ40 and WLL-1 strains from Fuzhou and Hangzhou, China, respectively."
