Partial phylogenetic tree of the DM9-protein family.DM9 proteins whose genes are located on chromosome 2 in An. gambiae were used for a blast search and the sequences of their closest homologues from different species: Ag, An. gambiae; Ad, An. darlingi; Cq, Culex quinquefasciatus; Aa, A. aegypti; Pp, Phlebotomus papatasi; NaV, Nasonnia vitripennis were aligned, together with two DM9 proteins from Drosophila (Dm: D. melanogaster). The sequence alignment was used to generate an unrooted tree Bootstrap values on 100 replicates are given. The scale bar represents 10% differences in protein sequences. The sequence alignment used to build the tree is shown in Figure S1, a more complete phylogenetic tree is provided in Figure S2 and a list of DM9 proteins with accession numbers is given in Table S1."
