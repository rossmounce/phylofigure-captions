Phylogeny of putative fungal proteins selected by BLAST from NCBI and the Broad Institute using 10 known FAE amino acid sequences as the BLAST query (sequences indicated by a dagger, †).149 unique putative proteins with a blast expect value ∼10−40 to any of the queries were aligned and a maximum likelihood phylogeny constructed as the consensus cladogram having at least 70% support in 100 bootstrap replicates. Bootstrap support (%) is shown at internal nodes. For each sequence, the organism, accession number and taxonomic class are shown. For biochemically characterized FAEs, the type A–D, is also indicated. Sequences have been colored according to taxonomic class."
