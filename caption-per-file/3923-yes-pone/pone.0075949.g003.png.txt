"pone.0075949.g003.png","Site-to-site variation in phylogenetic history across SD alignments.(A) Variation in tree topology across an alignment of ANKRD20A8P and 3 paralogous sequences in the 18p11.21 region. The dominant topology is depicted in red, with the two alternative unrooted topologies shown in green and blue. Informative positions within the CpG negative alignment are denoted by tick marks along the x-axis. Variation in tree topology across the alignment is shown, with colors corresponding to the 3 possible topologies. The midpoint between adjacent informative sites was used to estimate positions where the tree shifts to a new topology. (B) Variation in tree topology across an alignment of 4 genes in the PSG family. The PSG gene model is shown, with the region corresponding to the aligned region boxed in red."
