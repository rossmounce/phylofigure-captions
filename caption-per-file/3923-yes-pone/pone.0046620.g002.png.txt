"pone.0046620.g002.png","Consensus Bayesian phylogeny of the Daphnia pulex species complexbased on the mitochondrial ND5 and COX1 genes. The alignment contains 98 sequences consisting of 496 nt of ND5 and 552 nt of COX1 with 295 polymorphic positions of which 258 are phylogenetically informative. The tree is rooted through the midpoint. Posterior probabilities are indicated on the nodes of the tree and are not shown if less than 0.80. Isolates CT-17 and CT-18 were collected from Connecticut, USA."
