Phylogenetic relationships of BLUF domains found in different taxa.Maximun likelihood phylogenetic tree of BLUF domain constructed using sequences from different branches of Bacteria, Euglenozoa and Fungi. The accession numbers of the different sequences are indicated after the corresponding species names. The different clusters supported by bootstrap values (C1 to C4) within Acinetobacter are indicated. Paralogs from the same Acinetobacter species are indicated with the same color. The percentages of 1,000 bootstrap resamplings supporting the different clusters, as obtained by Neighbor Joining (above the lines) or parsimony (below the lines), are indicated atthe bifurcations (only bootstrap results of >50% are reported)."
