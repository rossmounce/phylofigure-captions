Distribution of phylogenetic groups in forest soil organic (ORG-S) and mineral (Min-S) horizons. A. RDP and SEED-bases analysis.The distribution of the reads and contigs generated in this study was performed using all the annotated reads against the SEED database and the identified 16S rRNA fragments against the RDP database. B. Community comparison. The phylogenetic heatmap presented was performed using the Bray-Curtis similarity matrices generated by MG-RAST on the organic (O1,O2 and O3) and the mineral (M1,M2 and M3) metagenomic data."
