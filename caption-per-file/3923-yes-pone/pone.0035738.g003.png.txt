Conventional phylogenetic analysis produced by the neighbour-joining method of fliC amplicon sequences with fliC-for/fliC-rev primers [38] for reference strains and isolates of Dickeya dieffenbachiae (D. dadantii subsp. dieffenbachiae) and positioning of the Dickeya sequevars determined with the fliC-1/fliC-2 primers [37].Bootstrap values after 1000 replicates are expressed as percentages. The scale bar indicates the fraction of substitutions per site."
