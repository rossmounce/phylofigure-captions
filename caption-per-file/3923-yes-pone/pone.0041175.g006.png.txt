"pone.0041175.g006.png","Model of ADH1 paralog duplication and subsequent evolution in haplorhines.Thin vertical black arrows indicate the direction of the chromosome while thick vertical arrows identify ADH genes in the direction of transcription, with ADH1 paralogs in primates colored according to the intronic phylogeny in Fig. 2B. Dashed lines connect orthologs. Diagonal lines indicate the proposed phylogeny of haplorrhine ADH1 paralogs. The root of the haplorhine ADH1 tree is not specified because the duplication order of haplorhine ADH1 paralogs is ambiguous (see text). Putative gene conversions are indicated with open circles connected by vertical lines (from Table 4)."
