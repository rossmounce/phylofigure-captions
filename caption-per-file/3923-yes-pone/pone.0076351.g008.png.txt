2MIT Phylogenetic analysis.(A) Unrooted phylogenetic tree of 2MIT protein in 21 Drosophilidae, 4 Lepidoptera and Apis mellifera. Statistical support for nodes on the trees was evaluated by the bootstrapping values (Ã—500) shown in each branch point obtained by the Maximum-Likelihood method included in the MEGA 5.0 Software. (B) Colored bars at the right side of the phylogenetic tree represent binding motifs recognized by different factors in 2MIT ortholog cytoplasmic regions. CLV_NDR_NDR1: N-arginine dibasic convertase site; CLV_PCSK_KEX2_1: subtilisin-like proprotein convertases cleavage site; LIG_14-3-3_3: 14-3-3 ligand site; MOD_PKA_2: PKA Phosphorylation site; LIG_FHA_1 and LIG_FHA_2: FHA phosphopeptide ligands; MOD_N-GLC_1: N-glycosylation site; TRG_ER_diArg_1: di Arginine retention/retrieving signal; TRG_ENDOCYTIC_2: sorting signal motif; LIG_EVH1_1: EVH1 ligands."
