"pone.0094518.g004.png","Time-calibrated phylogenies of the major lineages of early terrestrial tetrapod herbivores (Captorhinidae, Diadectidae, Caseidae, and Edaphosauridae).Estimates of maximum body size of included taxa are placed within three weight categories in order to indicate the general trends, less than 10(green), 10â€“100 kg (blue), and more than 100 kg (red). We restricted our size ranges to the above bins because several taxa are known only from fragmentary remains or juveniles. Only those herbivorous taxa that were sufficiently complete to permit size estimates were included. See Material and Methods for details on body mass estimates. The taxa shown as open, colored boxes of various shades of green are all considered to be herbivores. The taxa shown as crosshatched boxes are all considered to be either carnivorous, or omnivorous."
