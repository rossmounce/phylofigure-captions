"pone.0028869.g003.png","Cytoplasmic domains of the FcRn sequences most likely reflect their phylogenetic position. Marsupials (possum, opossum, and wallaby) have relatively short cytoplasmic domains composed of 27–28 amino acid residues. The next phylogenetic step resulted in clades Atlantogenata and Boreoeutheria. The only (predicted) sequence we found belonging to Atlantogenata (elephant) shows a 7–8 amino acid longer cytoplasmic domain as compared to Marsupials. Boreoeutheria is composed of the sister taxa Laurasiatheria and Euarchontoglires. Species belong to Euarchontoglires analyzed so far (human, chimp, gorilla, orangutan, gibbon, rhesus, marmoset, lemur, rabbit, pika, squirrel, hamster, rat and mouse) preserved these extra amino acids of the FcRn C-terminal with the exception of the guinea pig (based on its predicted amino acid sequence). Rabbit lost five amino acids in a more N-terminal (or middle) part of the cytoplasmic domain. As pika (Ochotona), another Lagomorphs, possesses these residues, the five amino acid deletion is thus specific of either rabbit or Leporidae family. Animals belong to the Laurasiatheria clade (bovine, sheep, pig, horse, bat, dog and panda) lost 10 amino acids of their FcRn C-terminals. Phylogenetic tree was created based on Prasad et al. [45] where some branch lengths were optimized for clarity and space."
