Identification of recombination event between CU74 and ST1, which led to the recombinant strains GZ9081.BOOTSCAN evidence for the recombination origin on the basis of pair-wise distance, modeled with a window size 1000, step size 10, and 100 Bootstrap replicates; The right part of the panel were phylogenetic trees constructed based on recombination regions (1–1272+4385-end) and non-recombination regions (1272–4385) using Mega 4 software."
