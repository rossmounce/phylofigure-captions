"pone.0072448.g003.png","ML phylogenetic tree of HIV-1 subtype G pol (?1000 pb) sequences circulating in Cuba (n?=?35), and in central (n?=?71), western (n?=?366), eastern (n?=?10) and southern (n?=?3) African countries.Branches are colored according to the origin of each sequence, as indicated at the legend (bottom left). Shaded boxes highlight the position of the major HIV-1 subtype G Cuban clade (GCU). Key nodes with aLRT support values >0.80 (*) and ?0.90 (**) are indicated. The tree was rooted using HIV-1 subtype A1 and B reference sequences (gray branches). The branch lengths are drawn to scale with the bar at the bottom indicating nucleotide substitutions per site."
