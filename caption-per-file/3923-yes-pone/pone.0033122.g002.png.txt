Extended phylogenetic analysis for HBV polymerase region. Extended phylogenetic tree including 214 genomic sequence of HBV-polymerase region. In red unrelated HBV molecular variant which were obtained from patients referred to our laboratory in about 7 years. In black: 3 genotype D sequences from GenBank (AB205127; AB116266; X97848); 3 excluded case form our investigation (CE-55_1/2; CE-58; CE-77); The index case (CC-0); 3 confirmed cases (CC-1; CC-2; CC-3); the elute form multi-patients lancing device (mp-LD). Even after this new analysis CC-0, CC-1, CC-2, CC-3 and the elute from mp-LD formed a monophyletic cluster distinct from the other sequences by very high bootstrap value. The box indicates the epidemic cluster; the bars indicate the genetic distance."
