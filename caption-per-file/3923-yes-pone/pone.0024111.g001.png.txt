"pone.0024111.g001.png","Molecular phylogeny comparing silkworm gustatory receptors with putative sugar receptors from nine insect species. 69 gustatory receptors from B. mori (BmGrn) and putative sugar receptors from H. virescens (HvCrn), D. melanogaster (DmGrn), A. gambiae (AgGrn), A. aegypti (AaGrn), C. quinquefasciatus (CpGrn), A. mellifera (AmGrn), N. vitripennis (NvGrn), T. castaneum (TcGrn) and A. pisum (ApGrn) were used to construct the phylogenetic tree. Bootstrap support for B. mori sugar receptors and four novel bitter receptors are shown as the percentage of 1 000 replications, if they are above 50%, of optimization criteria of Bayesian posterior probabilities, maximum likelihood and maximum parsimony. GRs from different insect orders are indicated by different colors. Stars indicate the novel four BmGrs. BmGr8 and BmGr53 are highlighted in red text. Clades are background shaded as follows: Orange, sugar receptor clade; Green, bitter receptor clade; Pink, CO2 receptor clade; Blue, DmGr43a homologues. See Materials and Methods for details of the phylogenetic analysis."
