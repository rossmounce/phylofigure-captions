Phylogenetic relationships for HA (A) and NA (B) genes of the BbM viruses and analyzed H9N2 reference viruses. Neighbor-joining phylogenetic trees were generated using the MEGA program. Nucleotides 82 to 1396 for HA and 41 to 1363 for NA genes were analyzed. BbM viruses were underlined in red, while representative viruses from each lineage were highlighted in other colors and marked using bold black arrow.
