Phylogenetic relationships and gene structure of soybean Dof genes.(A) The phylogenetic tree of soybean Dof proteins constructed from a complete alignment of 78 GmDof proteins using MEGA 4.0 by the neighbor-joining method with 1,000 bootstrap replicates. Percentage bootstrap scores >50% are indicated on the nodes. The nine major phylogenetic subgroups designated I to IX are indicated. (B) Exon/intron structures of Dof genes from soybean. Exons are represented by green boxes and introns by black lines. The sizes of exons and introns can be estimated using the scale below."
