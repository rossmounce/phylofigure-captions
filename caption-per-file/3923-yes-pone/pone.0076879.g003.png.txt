Phylogenetic analyses based on sequences at individual marker (aâ€“c) or the combined sequences at three markers (d).NJ and ML phylogenetic analyses were conducted based on DNA sequences at Marker 1(a), Marker 2 (b), Marker 3 (c) and the combined sequences at the three markers (d). The two methods gave almost identical topologies. Nodal support values for NJ (before the slash) and ML analysis (after the slash) are given for branches receiving more than 70% support. Clades were named with marker names and Roman numbers."
