Majority-rule consensus phylogenetic tree of representative sequences of single-domain TFPs computed by maximum-likelihood using PhyML.Numbers refer to bootstrap confidence values; only those greater than 50% are shown. The sequence of the TFP domain of the Type II activin receptor was used to root the tree, but was removed from the figure. See Table S2 for the identity of the sequences in each grouping."
