The phylogenetic relationships inferred from ML analysis based on the GTR I γ model using the combined sequences of COII (702 bp), 16S (1601 bp), CytB (737 bp), and EF1-α (802 bp). Posterior probabilities of BI analysis followed by ML bootstrap values in parentheses are given on or beneath nodes if greater than 50%. Letters enclosed in circles indicates two group partitions: gossypii group as ‘clade G’ and other three groups as ‘clade F’. Arrow means a short divergence point."
