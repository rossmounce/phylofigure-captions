"pone.0021905.g002.png","Phylogenetic relationships of Plasmodium and Haemoproteus cytochrome b lineages recorded in houses sparrows and their prevalence (%) in eight geographic regions. Regions with more than 40 sampled sparrows were included: South West Europe (swE), South East Europe (seE), South East Mediterranean (seM), North Europe (nE), North America (NAm), South America (SAm), Kenya (Ken) and New Zealand (NZ). Lineages recorded in single individuals were excluded (7 in Europe, 3 in N America, 2 in S America and 1 in India). The phylogeny was constructed from 479 bp cytochrome b sequences using Bayesian Inference and rooted with three lineages of Leucocytozoon (see Methods). Numbers at the nodes indicate the Bayesian posterior probabilities (%) and the scale bar the expected substitutions per site. Morphospecies identified by microscopic examination of blood smears are shown."
