"pone.0082627.g004.png","Bootscanning plot of sequences covering the ORF1/2 overlap of GII. e/GII.4 recombinant HuzhouN121.(A) Bootscanning plot of HuzhouN121 using GII.1 (Hawaii/1971/US), GII.2 (Melksham/1994/UK), GII.4 (DenHaag89/2006/NL), and GII.e/GII.3 (IPH2172–09VG4/2009/BE) as subtype references. Dashed vertical lines indicate the start of the capsid gene. (B) Phylogenetic analyses of segment I (3'-ORF1) and segment II (5'-ORF2) deﬁned by bootscanning. The phylogenetic trees were constructed with MEGA 5.0 using the neighbor-joining method. Segment I of HuzhouN121 clustered with the GII.e subtype reference and segment II of HuzhouN121 clustered with the GII.4 subtype reference."
