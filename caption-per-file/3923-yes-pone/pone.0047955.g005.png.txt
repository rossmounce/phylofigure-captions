"pone.0047955.g005.png","A phylogenetic tree showing the relationship of DWV isolates.The partial sequences of RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of DWV from A. cerana collected from different geographic locations of China and from Apis mellifera retrieved from GenBank were aligned using ClustalW. The sequence of IAPV was used as an outgroup to root the tree. Numbers at each node represent bootstrap values as percentages of 500 and only bootstrap values greater than 50% are shown."
