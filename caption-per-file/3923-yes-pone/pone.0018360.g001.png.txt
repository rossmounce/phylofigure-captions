"pone.0018360.g001.png","Phylogenetic relationships among type 2 aVDPVs isolated from sewage in Israel between 1998 and 2007. A nearest-neighbor phylogenetic tree was prepared from the VP1 sequences (903 nt) of type 2 aVDPVs isolated from each of the different lineages that were associated with two different epidemiological sources [22] in central Israel using Clustal X and nj plot after bootstrapping sequence data 1000 times. Branches with bootstrap values less than 900 have been collapsed. The arrow indicates the isolate that did not respond to either the C2 or C10 compounds. The numbers in brackets indicate whether the isolate belongs to group 1 or 2 and the letter or letter and number that follows indicates the lineage or sub lineage within each group."
