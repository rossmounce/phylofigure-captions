"pone.0081681.g005.png","Distribution and phylogeny of deduced H. vitripennis Piwi proteins. Upper panel.Table showing the distribution of proteins involved in small RNA biogenesis and epigenetic processes, juvenile hormone metabolism, and genome plasticity. Bottom panel. The evolutionary relatedness of Piwi proteins of H. vitripennis with other insect Piwi proteins is shown. The evolutionary history was inferred using the Neighbor-Joining method. The percentage of replicate trees in which the associated taxa clustered together in the bootstrap test (500 replicates) is shown next to the branches."
