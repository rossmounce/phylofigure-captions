"pone.0083087.g001.png","Chronogram, geographic distribution and climate rates of evolution for Pelargonium clades.Background colors of the maps represent summer precipitation, except for clade A1, which portrays winter precipitation. Blue and red regions represent high and low precipitation respectively. Radar plots show the rate of evolution in felsens for each climate variable in each clade; values closer to the center of the web indicate slower rates of evolution while larger ? values indicate higher rates. For the actual values see Table S2. Major clades are colored in the phylogeny and radar plots. MAP?=? mean annual precipitation; WPP?=? mean winter precipitation; SPP?=? mean summer precipitation; WVPD?=? mean winter pressure deficit; SVPD?=? mean summer pressure deficit; HU?=? annual heat units; WSR?=? mean winter solar radiation; SSR?=? mean summer solar radiation; PCH?=? accumulated positive chill units."
