The partitioned Bayesian phylogenetic tree and network of haplotypes for L. bostrychophila and L. entomophila based on Cytb haplotypes. A, the partitioned Bayesian phylogenetic tree for both species; B, Median-joining network of haplotypes for L. bostrychophila; C, Median-joining network of haplotypes for L. entomophila; Numbers above the branches are Bayesian posterior probabilities (only values above 40% are shown) and taxa are haplotypes. In median-joining network, white dots represent substitutions (lost haplotypes); for each haplotype, the size is proportional to their observed frequencies. The SWCR group is coloured gray, the CCR group is coloured orange and the SCR group is coloured yellow."
