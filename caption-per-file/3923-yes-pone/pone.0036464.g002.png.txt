Phylogenies of H. erato and H. melpomene illustrating branching orders of co-mimetic country level populations within each species.Example phylogenies independently estimated for H. erato (black, left) and H. melpomene (orange, right) using the Minimise Deep Coalescence (MDC) method [32]. These correspond to cophylogenetic analysis “separate MDC countries 1” in Table 1. H. erato/H. melpomene co-mimics (see Figure 1) are indicated by grey lines. This is one of several possible phylogeny pairs with similarly high congruence (see Table 1). Taxon labels indicate the sampled biogeographic region (East or West of the Andes), and country (abbreviations are: CR Costa Rica, Pa Panama, E Ecuador, C Colombia, FG French Guiana, T Trinidad and Pe Peru)."
