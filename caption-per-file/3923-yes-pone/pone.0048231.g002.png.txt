Heat map visualization of archaeal proteomic properties across phyloecological clusters.In this heat map, the rows correspond to each species and the columns correspond to the proteomic features; therefore, each row depicts the subset of 5 proteomic features per given archaeon. Normalized values of each feature are associated with the colors in the heat map as shown on the legend on the left side. The cluster tree was built with correlation metric and average linkage, same as in Fig. 1. Three main phyloecological clusters are highlighted with three different colors of the branches (yellow: hyperthermophiles and hyperthermoacidophiles; blue: halophiles and extreme halophiles; red: mesophilic methanogens and thermoacidophiles)."
