The phylogeny of Pomacentridae study species and antipredator response to heterospecific alarm cues.The phylogenetic relationship and antipredator response of Amphiprion percula, to heterospecific family members (Amphiprion melanopus ? Pomacentrus moluccensis, Acanthochromis polyacanthus and Chromis atripectoralis), a distantly related sympatric prey guild member (Asterropteryx semipunctatus) or a saltwater control. a) A chronogram (modified from [45]) displaying the divergence times of the MRCA of the focal species, A. percula to each of the heterospecific donor lineages within the family Pomacentridae. Ages are calibrated to millions of years before present. b) The mean change in foraging rate (?SE) of juvenile A. percula exposed to the chemical alarm cues of five heterospecific species and a saltwater control. Fishes are ordered with respect to their relatedness to A. percula. Letters below bars indicate Tukey?s groupings."
