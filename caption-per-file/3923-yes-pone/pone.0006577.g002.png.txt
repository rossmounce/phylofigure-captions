"pone.0006577.g002.png","Maximum likelihood phylogeny of Parabasalia, with an emphasis on the Cristomonada subgroup (to which Coronympha and ‘Metacoronympha’ belong).Branches are labeled with the GenBank Locus, followed by the genus and species where known, or in the case of unidentified termite symbionts, but the genus and species of the termite and the word ‘symbiont’. Locus IDs were not available for new sequences: the accession numbers for these are FJ986219-22 for Coronympha from I. snyderi, I. banksi, I. milleri, and I. schwarzi, respectively. Numbers at nodes correspond to maximum likelihood bootstrap support (top), and Bayesian posterior probabilities (bottom). The Coronympha-morph and Metacoronympha-morph from a given Incisitermes species are shown in shaded boxes with the host indicated to the right. In all four cases, these two sequences were identical or nearly identical. Environmental sequences from the same host were likewise identical (not shown). The previously reported ‘M. senta’ from I. snyderi branches with the other sequences from I. snyderi, as expected. The C. octonaria and unidentified ‘Ii1’ sequences reported previously from I. snyderi and I. immigrans are both virtually identical to sequences from I. schwarzi, and appear to be due to termite misidentification (see text for details)."
