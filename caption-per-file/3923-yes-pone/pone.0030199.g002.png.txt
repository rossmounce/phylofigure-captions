SNP group-based P. savastanoi phylogenetic analysis. UPGMA dendrogram constructed using the concatenated bases for the ten SNPs obtained for each of the 56 P. savastanoi strains. On the right of the dendrogram the designation of each cluster is reported, as pathovars (Psv, Psn and Psf) and as SGs (roman numbers). Bootstrap values (1,000 replicates) are indicated on the corresponding nodes. Genetic similarity among strains and pathovars was estimated by p-distance method, computed on MEGA 5."
