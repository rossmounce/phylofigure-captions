"pone.0012437.g003.png","Phylogram of the microeukaryotic 18S rRNA phylotypes obtained from the microcosm sediment samples.A representative sequence of each OTU determined by DOTUR003 and the nearest neighbours obtained by using the aligner tool of the SILVA database project were used OTUs nomination: T0, without oil contamination (in blue); T23 2%, 23 days after 2% of oil contamination (in red); T66, 66 days after 2% of oil contamination (in red) The phylogram was calculated with MEGA 40 using the neighbour-joining method and the Jukes-Cantor model Numbers at the branches show the bootstrap percentages (above 50% only) after 1000 replications of bootstrap sampling."
