PHYML analysis of genes with homology to oomycete genes with predicted domains for arginine, ornithine or diaminopimelate decarboxylase activity.Numbers at nodes indicate bootstrap support values (100 replications). Gene names are color coded to indicate the major phylogenetic groups: archaea, purple; bacteria, blue; plants, green; stramenopiles, red."
