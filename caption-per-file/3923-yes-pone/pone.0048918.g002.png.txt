"pone.0048918.g002.png","Comparison of CAMP factors and Uberis factor found in streptococci.A. multiple sequence alignment (Sag, S. agalactiae; S. urinalis; S. canis; S. pyogenes; S. porcinus; S. pseudo porcinus and S. uberis); B. phylogenetic tree showing the evolutionary relationships between the sequences of the alignment. Sequence alignment and construction of the phylogenetic tree were done using the AlignX module of VectorNTI advance 11 (InVitrogen). Conserved residues appear in light grey and identical amino acids appear in dark grey in the alignment. Position of residues in the sequence is indicated above the sequence. Sequence identities go from 56% (CAMP factor II of S. agalactiae and Uberis factor of S. uberis) to 100% (CAMP factor II of S. agalactiae and CAMP factor of S. urinalis). The CAMP factor of P. acnes is more distant (less than 30% of identity) and thus does not appear in this alignment. The phylogenetic tree has been constructed using the Neighbor Joining Method. Each branch of the tree has a length equal to the number of substitutions required to get from one nod to the next."
