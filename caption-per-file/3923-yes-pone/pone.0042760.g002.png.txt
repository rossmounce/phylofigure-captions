An example of six communities associated to a hypothetical phylogenetic tree.All species are scored as present or absent in each example and all branch lengths are set to one. Phylogenetic beta diversity (PBD) values were computed for several pairs of communities according to the PhyloSor and UniFrac indices and their respective turnover and phylogenetic diversity components (see Table 1 and main text for more details)."
