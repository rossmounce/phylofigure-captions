Maximum clade credibility tree of HIV-1 and different SIVs based on their RT genes.Ancestral host states were reconstructed using Bayesian phylogeographic inference framework implemented in the BEAST v1.6.2 package. The host state posterior probabilities of the most recent common ancestors (MRCAs) are shown on the left upper panel. The tree branches are colored according to their respective host species. The red solid nodes on the trees represent the MRCAs of corresponding virus strains. Estimated times of the MRCA are shown at corresponding nodes. BC: before Christ."
