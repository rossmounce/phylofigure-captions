Phylogenetic tree of the RpoB superfamily. All RpoB sequences were grouped into clusters using the Lek algorithm. Representatives of each cluster that contained >2 members were then selected and aligned using MUSCLE. A phylogenetic tree was built by from this alignment using PHYML; bootstrap values are based on 100 replicas. The Lek cluster ID precedes each sequence accession ID. Proposed subfamilies in the RpoB superfamily are shaded and given a name on the right. The two novel RpoB clades that contain only GOS sequences are highlighted by the colored panels."
