Consensus tree from Bayesian analysis of the four combined cpDNA datasets.The 50% majority rule consensus phylogram from partitioned Bayesian analysis of a combined matrix of 284 accessions and 6699 bp from four plastid genes: atpB, matK, ndhF and rbcL. The 400,000 generations before the point when the SDSF permanently fell below 0.01 (0.0016 at termination) were discarded as burn-in. Three types of support (bootstrap percentages for parsimony analyses with equal weights [EW]/successive approximations weighting [SW]/posterior probabilities for Bayesian analysis [PP]) are indicated on each branch. Major clades are named following the subfamily classification of three expanded asparagalean families proposed by Chase et al. (2009) and APG III (2009). The tree is subdivided as follows: part A, Asparagaceae and subfamilies; part B, Amaryllidaceae and Xanthorrhoeaceae and their subfamilies plus Xeronemataceae; part C, the basal nodes of Asparagales and outgroups (non-Asparagales taxa)."
