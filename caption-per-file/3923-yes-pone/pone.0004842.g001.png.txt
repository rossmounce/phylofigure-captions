"pone.0004842.g001.png","Bayesian trees for the HA (left) and NA (right) gene of A/H5N1 representative strains from Africa, Europe and Middle East (clade 2.2).Different colours are used to differentiate the viruses from distinct sublineages. Posterior probabilities are indicated above branches. Scale bar represents the number of substitutions per site. The map highlights the countries where influenza viruses were isolated. The colours of the map are the same adopted in the phylogenetic trees indicating the sublineages of clade 2.2."
