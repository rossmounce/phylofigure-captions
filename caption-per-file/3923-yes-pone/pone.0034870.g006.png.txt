"pone.0034870.g006.png","Structural mapping of molecular interaction field conservation in human Rab GTPase subclusters.Simplified Rab family tree in which representatives of subclusters from the electrostatic potential comparison (Fig. 2B) are displayed with the similarity of molecular interaction fields among the subcluster members. Cartoons are shown in two views, the ones close to the branch focus on the switch I and II regions and the ones further away are shown rotated by 180Â° around the vertical axis. The nucleotide is shown in a pink stick representation. The average of all pair-wise SI scores of all members of each subfamily is mapped onto the protein structure as a color gradient from blue (variable), through green (intermediate) to red (conserved) for A: electrostatic potential and B: hydrophobic interaction field. Positive HIF energies were neglected for similarity calculations and those regions are represented in black. For an alternative subclustering according to the sequence-based phylogentic tree, see also File S1."
