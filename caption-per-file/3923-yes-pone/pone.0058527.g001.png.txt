Neighbor-joining tree of 16 S–23 S ITS Limnohabitans sequences including probe targets. Neighbor-joining tree based on 16 S–23 S ITS sequences (about 1400 bp) of Limnohabitans genus including described species, undescribed strains and environmental clones, following the new Limnohabitans phylogeny as suggested by [6]. Groupsgroups targeted by the 18 probes are indicated by different colors. For more information on isolates see [6]."
