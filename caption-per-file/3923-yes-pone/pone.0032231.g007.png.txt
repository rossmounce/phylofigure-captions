Model for the evolution of teleost Hox gene organization. Schematic Hox clusters [10], [26], [52] are superimposed on a species phylogeny with estimates of divergence times [53], [54] â€“ which vary considerably between studies [33]. Ancestral architectures are inferred on the basis of maximum parsimony, i.e. the number of cluster duplications and gene loss events is minimized. Salmo salar (Atlantic salmon) has presumably lost several duplicate clusters [26] (not shown). Deduced gene loss in a lineage is illustrated by a cross, question marks denote uncertainty about cluster gene content in the pre-TSGD actinopterygian Polypterus senegalus (bichir). Arrows indicate the possible origins of the leptocephalus body plan."
