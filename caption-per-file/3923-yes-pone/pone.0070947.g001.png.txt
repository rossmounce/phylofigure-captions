"pone.0070947.g001.png","Sequence analysis of eukaryotic and prokaryotic SLC1 transporters.(A) Sequence alignment of TMD8 region from human, insect, bacterial, and archael transporters. CuqDCT, CuqEAAT, AeaDCT, and AeaEAAT represent the EAAT and DCT orthologs from Culex quinquefasciatus and Aedes aegypti, respectively. AngEAAT1 and AngEAAT2 represent the transporters from Anopheles gambiae. Drosophila EAAT1/2 are from Drosophila melanogaster, Gltph from Pyrococcus horikoshii, and DctA is from Bacillus subtilis. Highlighted TMD8 residues involved in substrate binding are labeled above using human EAAT3 numbering. R447 and N451 are conserved in all EAAT-like orthologs, while D444 and T448 are changed to asparagine and alanine, respectively in the CuqDCT and AeaDCT mosquito transporters. Sequence alignments were performed with ClustalX2 and Jalview. (B) The phylogenetic relationship of the EAAT and DCT proteins from Culex quinquefasciatus and Aedes aegypti mosquito species together with the two EAATs from Drosophila (ClustalX2 based alignment)."
