Phylogenetic tree and domain architecture of histone methyltransferase (HMTs).Neighbour-Joining phylogenetic tree are constructed based on protein alignments of Arabidopsis and soybean HATs proteins using ClustalX2. Bootstrap values greater than 50% are shown at the nodes and tree is drawn to given scale of branch lengths. The schematic diagrams show the domain organization of these proteins according to analysis by NCBI Batch-CD, SMART and PFAM searches. Different domains are indicated by the use of different colours as shown at the bottom of the figure. The accession numbers for the sequences used in the alignment are listed in the figure."
