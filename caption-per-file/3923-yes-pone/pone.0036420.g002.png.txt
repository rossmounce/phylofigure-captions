"pone.0036420.g002.png","Comparison of phylogenetic trees of HD (A) and SD (B) regions of Six class transcription factors.The phylogenetic trees were calculated by the maximum likelihood method (WAG protein substitution model, bootstrap 1000) and processed by NJ Plot software. Phylogenetically representative sequences from the following metazoan animals were selected for comparison: sponges (Chalinula loosanoffi, Ephydatia fluviatilis, Sycon calcaravis), cnidarians (Nematostella vectensis, Anthopleura japonica, Podocoryne carnea, Hydra magnipapillata, Cladonema radiatum, Aurelia aurita), invertebrates (Saccoglossus kowalevskii, Drosophila melanogaster, Branchistoma floridae) and vertebrates (Danio rerio and Homo sapiens). For the list of ID numbers of reference sequences see Text S1."
