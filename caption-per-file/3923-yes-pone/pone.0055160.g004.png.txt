"pone.0055160.g004.png","Phylogeny, morphology, and ecology of Agaricales TH9235.Maximum likelihood phylogeny (A) based on 28S rDNA shows inconclusive placement of Agaricales TH9235 within the mushroom-forming fungal order Agaricales (Basidiomycota). Nodes with bootstrap support ?70 are indicated by black circles. Taxa considered ectomycorrhizal (ECM) based on Tedersoo et al. [36] are indicated by bold text, all other species are considered to be either saprotrophic, parasitic, or have an unknown trophic mode. Agaricales TH9235 is nested in a clade that includes pink-spored, saprotrophic and pink-spored ECM Entoloma species as well as the white-spored saprotrophic species Clitocybe hesleri, but this group lacks statistical support. Macroscopic photograph (B) shows fresh orange, tricholomatoid mushrooms of Agaricales TH9235 (Bar?=?10 mm). Close-up photograph (C) illustrates a large cluster of ECM Dicymbe roots colonized by the white mycelium of Agaricales TH9235 (Bar?=?10 mm)."
