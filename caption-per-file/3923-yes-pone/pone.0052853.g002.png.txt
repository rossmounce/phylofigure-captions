Principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) plot for archaeal amoA gene assemblages based on the eight types of habitats deduced from the online Fast UniFrac software (a).Hierarchical clustering analysis (UPGMA algorithm with 100 replicates Jackknife supporting test) for the all archaeal amoA gene sequences represent of eight types of habitats according to the online Fast UniFrac software. The number of sequence (n), number of libraries (Nlib), phylogenetic diversity with s.d. (PD?s.d.) and phylogenetic species variability (PSV) in each habitat is given. S.d. for PSV index was less than 0.001 for all habitats (b)."
