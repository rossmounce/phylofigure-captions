"pone.0095088.g005.png","Phylogenetic Analysis of Toc-GTPases from Tomato and Other Species.Amino acid sequences of Toc159 and Toc34 homologues from different species were aligned and used to produce a phylogenetic tree. Bootstrap values are given in the branch. Genes and accession numbers of the sequences used are as follows: slToc34-1, XM_004235160; slToc34-2, Solyc05g052160.2.1; slToc159-1, Solyc09074940.1.1; slToc159-2, XM_004229523; slToc159-3, Solyc11g043010.1.1; slToc159-4, XM_004230964; atToc159, At4g02510; atToc132, At2g16640; atToc120, At3g16620; atToc90, At5g20300; atToc33, At1g02280; atToc34, At5g05000; psToc159, AAF75761; psToc34, Q41009; osToc86-like_1, AAG48839; osToc86-like_2, AAK43509; zmToc34-1, CAB65537; zmToc34-2,CAB77551; H-Ras p21, P01112. Species of origin of the sequencesare indicated as follows: sl, Solanum lycopersicon at, Arabidopsis thaliana; ps, Pisum sativum; os, Oryza sativa; zm, Zea mays. H-Ras p21 is from human."
