"pone.0036466.g004.png","Global phylogenetic trees after AbundantOTU and QIIME denoising.Global phylogenetic trees show the distribution of taxonomy among all the pregnant and non-pregnant subject samples. The internal cluster dendrograms are colored by taxa Family level projections (annotated in figure legend), while the mid-circle is colored by the majority origins of OTUs from pregnant or non-pregnant subject samples (pregnant-magenta; non-pregnant-brown). Outermost circle using text to indicates OTU projection to Order level (Bacteroidales-red, Actinomycetales-yellow, Lactobacillales-green, Clostridiales-blue). OTU tables and representative sequences generated from AbundantOTU (Figure 4A) and QIIME denoised (Figure 4B) datasets were employed in generating these global phylogenetic trees."
