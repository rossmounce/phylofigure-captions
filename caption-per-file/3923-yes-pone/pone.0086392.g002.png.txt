"pone.0086392.g002.png","A neighbour joining tree showing phylogenetic comparisons the aa sequences of T2 (VP2(T2) of mosquito-borne and tick-borne orbiviruses and VP3(T2) of Culicoides-borne orbiviruses) aligned with those of ORUV, LEBV and CGLV.The tree depicts the groups of Culicoides-borne and sandfly-borne viruses having their VP3 as the T2 protein, while the tick-borne and mosquito-borne viruses having their VP2 as the T2 protein. LEBV, ORUV and CGLV all cluster among Culicoides-borne orbiviruses. The scale bar represents the number of substitutions per site."
