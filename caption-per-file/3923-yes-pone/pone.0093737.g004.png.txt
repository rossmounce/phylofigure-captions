The phylogeny of EV-C species VP1 gene.The phylogenetic tree was constructed from complete VP1 coding region (consensus alignment 927 nucleotides) of those CVA-21 (red), CVA-24 (green), EV-C95 (yellow), EV-C96 (orange) and EV-C99 (blue) strains, of which a complete VP1 sequence was available (GenBank search 27.2.2013), and the prototype strains of other EV-C types. The tree was constructed using the Neighbour-Joining method and the Tamura-Nei substitution model. The bootstrap support values were calculated for 1000 replicates. The bootstrap support values >70 are shown."
