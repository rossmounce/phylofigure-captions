The evolution of the respiratory apparatus in pterosaurs.Tree based on Unwin (2003, 2004), stratigraphic data correct to 2008 (Unwin, unpublished data) and the chronology of Gradstein et al. (2004)[50]. Black bars indicate known stratigraphic ranges of the main pterosaur clades, listed at right. Dashed section of bars denotes range extension based on an unverified record. Thick black lines signify a range extension inferred from phylogenetic relationships. Color-filled circles represent occurrences of pneumatization with the following distributions: red = vertebral column; yellow = postaxial pathway in the forelimb; blue = preaxial pathway in the forelimb and in some cases (lonchodectids, Tupuxuara, azhdarchids) a limited presence in the hind limb. Clades in which one or more species reached a wingspan of more than 2.5 metres are shown in underlined dark blue text, and more than 5.0 metres, in caps. A, Basic pterosaurian breathing pump (sternum, vertebral and sternal ribs, gastralia and prepubes): B, notarium. Taxa referred to in the text: 1, Dimorphodon; 2, Eudimorphodon; 3, Rhamphorhynchus; 4, Anhanguera; 5, Pteranodon; 6, Dsungaripterus; 7, Tapejara; 8, Tupuxuara; 9, Quetzalcoatlus."
