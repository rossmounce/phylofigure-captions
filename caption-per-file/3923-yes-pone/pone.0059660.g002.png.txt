"pone.0059660.g002.png","Molecular phylogeny of haplotypes and their distribution in study populations.Left is a tree constructed by neighbor-joining (NJ) method. Three numbers on a tree path indicate percent bootstrap values (1,000 replications) obtained from statistical assessments by neighbor-joining (NJ), maximum likelihood (ML) and maximum parsimony (MP) algorithms in order. Branches corresponding to partitions reproduced in less than 70% bootstrap replicates were collapsed. Each of black bars aside the tree shows a mtDNA clade inferred from the cluster analyses. Right score illustration summarized distribution of mtDNA haplotypes in study populations. Numbers with closed, open circles and without circle mean the observed number of male, female and sex-unknown samples, respectively, for each study population with different color."
