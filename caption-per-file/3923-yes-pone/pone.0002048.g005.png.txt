"pone.0002048.g005.png","Consensus phylogenetic tree of the portal gene from both sequenced phages and phages isolated from different geographical locations.Group 1, Group 2 and database phage sequences as in Figures 2, 3. The non-mazG group, RS60, RS84, RS76, S-IO8, 1048, RS22, IO25 and IO12 comprise phage sequences for which our primers failed to detect mazG. Trees are unrooted and were generated from DNA codon alignments. Clade support values are shown at the nodes of the clades, only values below 0.95 are shown. Group 1 and Group 2 phage are coloured red and green respectively with phage sequences from NCBI in orange, as in Figure 3. The non-mazG phage group are coloured black."
