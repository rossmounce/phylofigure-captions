Bayesian inference (BI) phylogeny of the SSU rDNA of Gambierdiscus species/phylotypes.Nodal supports are of Bayesian posterior probability (pp) and Bootstrap (bt) values obtained by BI analysis and Maximum likelihood (ML) analysis, respectively. Nodes with strong supports (pp/bt ?=?1.00/100) are shown as thick lines. For sequences obtained via cloning, a variant ID, starting with C, is shown followed by strain ID (i.e. KW070922_1_C4). Sequences obtained in the present study are indicated in color. A moderately supported branch (1.00/84) indicated by an asterisk consists of the temperate strains, whereas the others in Gambierdiscus sp. type 1 are all of the subtropical origin."
