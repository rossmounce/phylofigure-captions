Bremer support and bootstrap resampling frequencies for the phylogenetic hypothesis presented here.Numbers below the nodes are Bremer support, absolute bootstrap and GC bootstrap resampling frequencies, respectively, for the single most parsimonious tree recovered here. Numbers above the nodes and with an asterisk are Bremer support values after a posteriori pruning of fragmentary saurian terminals (see text)."
