Phylogenetic relationship of the HIV sequences of 6 LTCF A residents with HIV infection (4 newly diagnosed), 23 reference US subtype B sequences, and one reference subtype C sequence (the outgroup).The 6 LTCF A residents are shown by the solid boxes. The tree was derived from a nucleotide alignment of the 1497-bp pro-pol region. Trees were inferred from 3 different phylogenetic analysis methods (neighbor-joining, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian inference) which independently showed that 2 sequences (COB 2 and COB 3) consistently cluster together with high bootstrap/statistical support (99/100/1.0 respectively). These two sequences show a pairwise nucleotide identity of 99.3%."
