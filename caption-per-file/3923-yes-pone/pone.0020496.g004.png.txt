Molecular phylogenetic analyses of Rhodacmea populations. Results for two genetic markers are shown: a bayesian consensus phylogram derived from the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I (mt COI) dataset and the single most parsimonious tree found for the nuclear second internal transcribed ribosomal spacer (ITS-2) dataset. For the former, available New World Laevapecini haplotypes were employed as outgroups [24]. For the latter, the Old World Ancylus fluviatilis was the outgroup [24]. Nodal support levels >50 are shown above the respective branches: MP bootstrap/ML bootstrap/Bayesian posterior probabilities for COI tree and MP bootstrap for ITS-2 tree. GenBank accession numbers are given for non-novel genotypes."
