Ancestral recombination graph of TYR haplotypes.The tree is rooted by the chimpanzee sequence and presents recombination history of 942 worldwide samples (1884 chromosomes). Haplogroup frequency by populations is shown below the tree. Haplogroup names are shaded in yellow. Green arrows show the origin of recombination prefixes, blue arrows show the origin of recombination suffixes. Recombination points are shown by rectangles. Numerical superscript prefixes to the left of rs identifiers correspond to the relative physical position of SNPs. SNPs which were out of the range of our re-sequencing alignment are marked with superscript suffixes to the right of respective rs identifiers and correspond to the following phylogenetic equivalents in our re-sequencing data: A – rs12799137, B – rs7108676, C – rs12799347, D – rs12417632, E and F – rs5021654, G – rs7934747, H – rs1126809. Non-synonymous mutations or their phylogenetic equivalents are shown in red font with amino-acid substitutions specified. 95% confidence intervals for the detected haplogroup frequencies are given in Table S6."
