Diversity of carp SITR-related molecules encoded in the zebrafish genome. A. Schematic organization of human CD300 and PIGR loci on chromosomes (Chr) 17 and chromosome 1. B. Schematic organization of zebrafish SITR loci identified on chromosome 1, chromosome 2 (sites 2a and 2b), chromosome 15 (sites 15a and 15b) and chromosome 19. C. Unrooted phylogenetic tree showing the relationship between the carp SITR amino acid sequences for the full-length molecule with other known vertebrate Ig-like receptor sequences. This tree was constructed by the ‘neighbour-joining’ method using the clustal X and treeview packages, and was bootstrapped 10,000 times. All bootstrap values less than 75% are shown. The GenBank accession numbers (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/) of the human CD300 amino acid sequences are: CD300A, NP_009192.2; ; CD300B, NP_777552.2 ; CD300C, NP_006669.1 ; CD300D, NP_001108624.1; CD300E, NP_852114.1; CD300F, NP_620587.2 ; CD300G, NP_660316.1. The GenBank accession numbers (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/) of the mouse CD300 amino acid sequences are: CD300A, CAM18755.1; CD300B, NP_954691.2 ; CD300C, NP_954695.1; CD300D, NP_663412.1 ; CD300E, NP_742047.1; CD300F, NP_663609.2; CD300G, NP_082263.2. The GenBank accession numbers (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/) of the skate sequences are: MDIR2, ABC86796.1; MDIR3, ABC86797.1; MDIR4, ABC86799.1. The GenBank accession numbers (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/) of the mammalian PIGR are: RAT, NP_036855.1; MOUSE, NP_035212.2; HUMAN, NP_002635.2; COW, NP_776568.1; RABBIT, NP_001164516.1. The Genbank accession numbers (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/) of the carp sequences are: PIGR, ADB97624.1; SITR, HM370297."
