"pone.0092293.g002.png","Phylogenetic relationships and haplotypes network of host insects from 43 O. sinensis populations in the QTP.(Left) Bayesian haplotypes phylogenetic tree of host insects based on COI gene sequences. Numbers on branches are Bayesian posterior probabilities, bootstrap support values of Maximum likehood and Neighbour-Joining trees (BI/ML/NJ), and * represented posterior probabilities <0.6 or support values <60%. The black bars on the right indicate the corresponding group number in the nested clade phylogeographic analysis, and each group or subgroup was presented with different colors. (Right) Haplotype networks of host insects corresponding to the group III and IV. The relative sizes of circles in the network are proportional to haplotype frequencies. The small black dots indicate hypothetical missing haplotypes. The haplotype colors correspond to those in phylogenetic tree on the left."
