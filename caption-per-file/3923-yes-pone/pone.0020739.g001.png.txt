"pone.0020739.g001.png","Schematic representation of the phylogeny of the genus Saccharomyces. The tree topology combines information from genome-wide studies [47], rDNA sequence data [3], four concatenated nuclear genes [23] and our own sequence analyses. The maximum growth temperature of each species is indicated on the right side (data from this study)."
