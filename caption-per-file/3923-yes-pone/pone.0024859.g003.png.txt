Two instances of multiple adenoviral DNA sequences amplified from a single donor. Sequences amplified from donors 5 and 13 and the source of the DNA from which sequences were amplified is shown in the tables. The phylogenetic relationships between these sequences as computed using the nearest neighbor algorithm of Saitou and Nei [21] is also shown. The calculated distance value for each sequence is shown in parentheses (Vector NTI, AlignX module)."
