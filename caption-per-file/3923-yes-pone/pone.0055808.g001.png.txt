"pone.0055808.g001.png","CPXV phylogeny.This figure was reprinted from Carroll et al. [16] under the creative commons license. The tree search was based on alignments of the entire coding regions C23L-B29R of 12 CPXV isolates as described in [16]. The two clades ?cowpox-like? and ?vaccinia-like? are highlighted, together with the clusters (1 to 5). The virus strains studied here are composed of ?cowpox-like? viruses including CPXV-GER-1980-EP4 (cluster 1), CPXV-GER1991-3 (cluster 2), CPXV-BR (cluster 3), and of ?vaccinia-like? viruses (cluster 5) including CPXV-FIN2000-MAN and CPXV-AUS1999-867. Although not appearing in the tree, VACV-WR, cluster 5, was also used here."
