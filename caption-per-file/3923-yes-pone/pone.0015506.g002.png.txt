Phylogenetic tree, protein domains, and exon-intron structure of Nme5 in Eukaryotes. A. The phylogenetic midpoint-rooted tree was constructed as described in Figure 1A. B. Corresponding protein domain structure of Nme proteins. Protein domain information was obtained using Genbank Conserved Domain Database [40]. Parentheses indicate that the domain type is the best hit given by NCBI CDD but is not a specific hit according to CDD default parameters. C. Exon/intron gene structure was obtained as described in Figure 1B."
