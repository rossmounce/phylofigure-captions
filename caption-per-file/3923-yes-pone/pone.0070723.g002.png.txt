"pone.0070723.g002.png","A phylogenetic tree of MLO proteins, showing that CaMLO1 and CaMLO2 are grouped together with AtMLO2, AtMLO6, AtMLO12 and SlMLO1, SlMLO3, SlMLO5 and SlMLO8 (grey-marked circle).This tree was constructed with Phylogeny.fr [44], using the radial view by TreeDyn. The unrooted radial tree comprises all 15 Arabidopsis MLO paralogs [28], tomato SlMLO1, SlMLO3, SlMLO5 and SlMLO8 as well as CaMLO1 and CaMLO2, in addition to pea PsMLO1, grape VvMLO1, barley HvMLO, rice OsMLO1 and maize ZmMLO1. The tree was established on the basis of an optimized multiple-sequence alignment. Numbers above nodes indicate bootstrap values (based on 100 replicates) that support the respective branch. The scale (lower left corner) indicates the number of amino acid exchanges per site."
