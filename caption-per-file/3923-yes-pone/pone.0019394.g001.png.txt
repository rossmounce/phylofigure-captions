Alignment and phylogenetic analysis of Her8a and the H/E(spl) family. (A) Amino acid alignment of human, mouse, Chicken, Xenopus laevis, and zebrafish Hes6 related sequences. Residues identical in all proteins are marked in black boxes and partial conservation is shown in grey boxes. The basic helix-loop-helix domain, orange domain and C terminal WRPW motif are indicated, and LNHLL and SPXXSP motifs are underlined. (B) Phylogenetic tree for the H/E(spl) protein family. The full coding protein sequence was used for each family member. Trees were calculated with a bootstrap support of 100 replicates. The phylogram demonstrates only sequence relationships, but does not absolutely imply sequence ancestry since no ancestral relationship is assumed in initial alignments. The initial letter “h” denotes human, “m” mouse, “c” chicken, “x” Xenopus laevis and “z” zebrafish."
