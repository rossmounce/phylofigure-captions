"pone.0083675.g005.png","The phylogenetic relationship of the sand pear GDSL esterase/lipase genes (GELPs) differentially expressed between the green- (S1) and the russet-pericarp (S2) pools.The tree was constructed based on multiple sequence alignment of sand pear and rice GELP protein sequences using ClustalW program by NJ method with 1,000 bootstrap replicates. The different types of rice GELPs (Chepyshko et al., 2012) were used as the reference in the phylogenetic analysis. Subclades are numbered at the right part of the tree according to the rice results by Chepyshko et al. (2012). The sand pear GELPs marked in red or green show relative higher and lower transcript level in the russet pericarp pool library, comparing with that of the green pericarp pool library."
