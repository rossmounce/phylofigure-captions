"pone.0033212.g005.png","Computational analysis of the E3 and Fiber regions. (A) SimPlot analysis of the E3 and fiber region of HAdV-D59 compared to fully sequenced E3 and fiber regions from species HAdV-D. The arrows over the Bootscan demarcate the approximate positions of the E3 coding sequences. Phylogenetic analysis of (B) HAdV-D59 CR1β (C) HAdV-D59 CR1γ, and (D) fiber knob. The phylogenetic trees were generated from aligned sequences using MEGA, via the neighbor-joining method and a bootstrap test of phylogeny."
