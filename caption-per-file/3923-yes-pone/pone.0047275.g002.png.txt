"pone.0047275.g002.png","Phylogenetic analysis and sequence alignment of Arabidopsis DREB1s and their homologs in rice using ClustalW2.A: The phylogenetic analysis was carried out by the neighbour-joining method of ClustalW2, and the tree was edited and viewed by TreeView software. SD: segmental duplication; TD: tandem duplication; Transposition: single gene duplication by transposition. Bootstrap values from 1000 replicates were indicated at each node. Scale bar represented 0.1 amino acid substitution per site. B: The NLS (nuclear localization signal), ERF/AP2 domain, DSAW motif, and LWSY motif are shown. The alignment of the 141â€“171 region of CBF1 and the corresponding regions of its rice and Arabidopsis homologs has been omitted due to the absence of conserved motif."
