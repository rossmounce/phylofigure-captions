"pone.0076630.g004.png","Fap Systems within Metagenomes.FapA homologs were identified using the respective HMMs within 10 large metagenomes from a diverse range of habitats, see Table 2. The hits were aligned with the FapA homologs identified within the refseq protein database and phylogenetic trees were estimated using the neighbor-joining method. The phylogenetic tree is colored according to taxonomy. Betaproteobacteria (blue), Gammaproteobacteria (brown), and Deltaproteobacteria (red). Metagenome hits are highlighted in red text. Nonparametric bootstrap values are shown for each node. The absence of a bootstrap value represent 100% bootstrap support."
