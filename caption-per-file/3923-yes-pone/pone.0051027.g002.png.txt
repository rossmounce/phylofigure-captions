Frequencies of Wolbachia across arthropod orders.Proportions of infected species for all orders with n>10 species surveyed for Arsenophonus (A), Cardinium (C), Hamiltonella (H), Spiroplasma (S), and/or Wolbachia (W). ??? symbols indicate cases where data were not illustrated due to sample sizes of less than 10 surveyed species. Numbers of surveyed species are indicated below each respective bar. Data used for this figure were generated with diagnostic PCR surveys and are presented in Table S5. The phylogeny was drawn from information on the Tree of Life Website (tolweb.org). Only those orders with at least two symbionts meeting the above criteria are illustrated."
