Nucleotide sequence alignment and phylogenetic tree analysis for the complete genomes of ILTV strains.(A) Alignment of the complete genome sequences of Australian ILTV field strains and vaccines was performed using MAFFT. The Serva ILTV sequence was set as the reference sequence. Vertical lines indicate SNPs compared to the Serva sequence and dashes indicate sequence gaps. (B) Phylogenetic tree generated using the alignment and the UPGMA method. One hundred bootstrap replicates were used to assess the significance of the tree topology. A bar indicates nucleotide substitutions per site."
