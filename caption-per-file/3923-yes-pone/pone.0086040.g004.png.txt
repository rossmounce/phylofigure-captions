"pone.0086040.g004.png","Maximum Likelihood analysis between variants of the phaeoviral sequences of concatenations of DNApol and MCP.Variants are labelled according to DNApol identifier initially, followed by the MCP variant number in brackets. In order to slightly reduce the number of combinations of sequences, where individual gene phylogenies show a clear separation of individual variants, these are concatenated together and excluded from the other combinations. Single value node labels represent ML bootstrap values. Where nodes are labelled with two values, this indicates that both ML and Bayesian topologies agree (whole numbers represent ML bootstrap values, decimals indicate Bayesian posterior probability). Sub-group A viruses are labelled in blue, sub-group B viruses are red and the intermediate Flex virus variant is green. Bold values are those greater than 75% bootstrap or probability."
