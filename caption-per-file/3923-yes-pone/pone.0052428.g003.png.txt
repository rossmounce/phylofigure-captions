"pone.0052428.g003.png","Phylogenetic analysis of CCK protein sequences from D. sargus and various species.The best phylogenetic tree was obtained by Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method, using the JTT substitution model for 106 replicates, after discarding the first 25% obtained samples. The scale bar indicates the substitution rate per site. Numbers at nodes indicate posterior probability (range 0?1). Protein IDs (GenBank Accession Nos) are as reported in Table 2."
