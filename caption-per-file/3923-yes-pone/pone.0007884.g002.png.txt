Phylogenetic relationships among fungal samples from different hosts.Maximum clade credibility (MCC) tree from Bayesian coalescent analysis depicting the phylogenetic relationships among fungal samples collected from domesticated bread wheat (Ta, Triticum aestivum) and wild grasses (Ar, Agropyron repens; Dg, Dactylis glomerata; Lm, Lolium multiflorum). Clade-credibility values are shown only for the three major lineages. Asterisks denote nodes within lineages that received >90% posterior support."
