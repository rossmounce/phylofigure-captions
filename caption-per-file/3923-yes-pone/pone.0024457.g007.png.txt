Ca. Pelagibacter ubique is placed with free-living Alphaproteobacteria in a phylogenetic tree inferred from concatenated protein sequences. A phylogenetic inference of the alphaproteobacterial tree topology based on a concatenated alignment of 42 mitochondrially encoded proteins reveals a well-supported alphaproteobacterial phylogeny, in which the SAR11 clade, here represented by Ca. Pelagibacter ubique is placed among the free-living alphaproteobacteria rather than with the Rickettsiales. The tentative placement of the outgroup (OG) is indicated with an arrow. Phylogenies were produced using Bayesian methods with the CAT model. Posterior-probability values of 1 are not shown."
