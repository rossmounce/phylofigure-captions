Bayesian phylogenetic tree of IHHNV isolates.Posterior probabilities are indicated in the branch nodes. The tree was rooted using Asian isolates of IHHNV infecting P. monodon as outgroups and collapsed for clarity. Circles represent the region of haplotype origin in the northwestern coast of Mexico; white: north; gray: central; black: south; dotted: west coast of the Baja California Peninsula."
