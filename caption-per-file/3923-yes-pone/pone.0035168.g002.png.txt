"pone.0035168.g002.png","Gene order comparison among mitochondrial genomes of Chara vulgaris, Marchantia polymorpha, Physcomitrella patens, Megaceros aenigmaticus, Huperzia squarrosa, Cycas taitungensis, Oryza sativa, and Brassica napus. Species are arranged according to the organismal phylogeny of land plants and the outgroup [29]. Solid lines connect orthologous genes between species with the same orientation, and dashed lines connect those with the reversed orientation. Repeat sequences (shown in colored arrows) in Huperzia are color-coded: RepA – red, RepB – purple, RepC – blue, RepD – black, RepE – light green, RepF – green, RepG – orange, RepH – brown, and RepI – pink. The inferred number of events of deletion, duplication, inversion, and translocation required to bring the two adjacent chondromes into complete synteny is shown on the right between the two genomes."
