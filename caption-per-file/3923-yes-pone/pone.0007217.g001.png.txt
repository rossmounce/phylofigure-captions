RabX1 and RabX2 are specific to trypanosomatids.(A) Schematic representation of the RabX1 and RabX2 locus arranged on Trypanosoma brucei chromosome VIII. (B) Presence of RabX1 and RabX2 encoding sequences from trypanosomes in relation to additional fully sequenced Excavata lineages. RabX1 and RabX2 are found only in trypanosomatids, but not Naegleria gruberi, Giardia lamblia and Trichomonas vaginalis. Closed dots indicate gene is found, open dots not found. Schematic phylogenetic tree to indicate relationships between the lineages is on the left. (C) RT-PCR showing the presence of RabX1 and RabX2 in the major life stages of L. mexicana and T. cruzi. L, DNA ladder; C, no reverse transcriptase negative control; P, promastigote; M, metacyclic; A, amastigote; E, epimastigote."
