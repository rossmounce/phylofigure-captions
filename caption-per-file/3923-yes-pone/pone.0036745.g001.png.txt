"pone.0036745.g001.png","Phylogeny and Temporal and Geographical Occurrences of Basal Iguanodonts.Time-calibrated phylogeny of basal iguanodonts using the maximum agreement subtree of 16,270 MPTs calculated in PAUP. Timescale based upon Walker and Geissman [39]; numerical ages are in millions of years. Uncertainty in taxon ages indicated by lighter circles or ellipses. The branches leading to Edmontosaurus and Corythosaurus have been extended into the Santonian to reflect the probable age of the oldest known hadrosaurid, the lambeosaurine Aralosaurus [9], [40]."
