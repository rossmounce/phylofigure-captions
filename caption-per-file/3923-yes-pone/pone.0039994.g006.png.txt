"pone.0039994.g006.png","Reconstruction of symbiont phylogenies (Maximum Likelihood) based on the 16S rRNA gene.A: Chemoautotrophic symbionts of Bathymodiolus spp. B: Methanotrophic symbionts of Bathymodiolus spp. C: Chemoautotrophic symbionts of Vesicomyidae. For the notation of vesicomyid host species names, see legend for Figure 4. MAR species red (SMAR) and blue (NMAR). GoC = Gulf of Congo, JdF = Juan de Fuca Ridge. The trees were calculated with ARB software using PhyML (HKY substitution model, estimated proportion of invariable sites, four categories of substitution rates). Bootstrap values (1000 replicates) higher 70% are marked at the relevant branches. Phylotypes obtained in this study in bold red. Scale bars represent 1% estimated base substitution."
