"pone.0062047.g011.png","Phylogeny of Abelisauroidea.Topology is based on a reduced strict consensus tree from the phylogenetic analysis, with non-abelisaurids removed (see Figure S6 for full tree). The black bars for each taxon represent uncertainty in age, rather than known duration. The node labeled “I-M” indicates the clade of abelisaurids exclusive to Indo-Madagascar, whereas its sister clade “SA” is exclusive to South America."
