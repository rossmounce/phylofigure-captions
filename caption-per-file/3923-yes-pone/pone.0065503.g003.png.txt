"pone.0065503.g003.png","Phylogenetic analysis of putative COMT proteins.Phylogeny tree (phylogram) made with OMT proteins from Brachypodium (BdCOMT), rice (OsOMT), maize (ZmOMT) and Arabidopsis (AtOMT). The proteins known to be involved in lignification in ryegrass (LpCOMT), sorghum (SbCOMT), switchgrass (PvCOMT), fescue (FaCOMT) and poplar (PtCOMT) are included in the analysis and shown in red in the phylogram as well as Arabidopsis (AtOMT1) and Maize (ZmCOMT1) proteins. Brachypodium proteins (BdCOMT) are shown in green. Protein sequences are available in Information S1. Bootstrap values indicating the level of support for the displayed representation after re-sampling are shown on each node."
