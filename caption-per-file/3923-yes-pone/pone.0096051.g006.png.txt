"pone.0096051.g006.png","Molecular characterization and phylogenetic analyses of enterovirus 71 (EV71) isolates.Phylogenetic dendrogram constructed by the neighbor-joining method based on 508-bp partial VP1 sequence of the 124 EV71 strains isolated in this study and 38 reference strains. Strains indicated by a filled circle (•) and triangle (▴) are EV71 strains isolated from mild cases and severe cases, respectively, in a HFMD outbreak During April 2011 to March 2012. Bootstrap values with >70 replications are shown at the branch nodes as percentages. The scale bar represents the genetic distance. Strain CVA16 G-10 and CVA16 FY18 strain from China were used as out groups."
