"pone.0022592.g001.png","At right (R), haplotype networks obtained for the COI gene from Amazonian (a), Mediterranean (b), Cantabric (c) and Spanish freshwater (d) fish. At left (L), phylogenetic trees constructed based on COI protein sequences of the same samples. In the haplotype networks, yellow dots correspond to real haplotypes and red dots are internal nodes representing hypothetical intermediate mutations. For Spanish freshwater fish a phylogenetic tree cannot be constructed because the protein sequence is identical for the two species (Salmo trutta and Salmo salar)."
