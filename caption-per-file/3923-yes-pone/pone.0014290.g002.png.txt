"pone.0014290.g002.png","Phylogram showing the relationships among the six genera of Homoscleromorpha based on 18S rDNA analyses.The topology presented corresponds to the ML analysis. Outgroups are Calcarea (AM180965, AM180976, AF100945) and Demospongiae (AY737637, AY737638) species. The Homoscleromorpha species are split into two robust clades: A and B. The numbers are from top to bottom: posterior probabilities for BI and bootstrap values (>50) for ML and MP respectively. Bayesian and MP analyses recovered slightly different phylogenies (Fig. S2). The black square points out the node corresponding to Homoscleromorpha."
