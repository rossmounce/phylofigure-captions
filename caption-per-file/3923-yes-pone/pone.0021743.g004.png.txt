SNP identification and phylogeny obtained from genomic sequencing of 8 castor bean accessions. A) 83 high quality SNPs identified in the chloroplast genomes of the 8 sequenced chloroplast accessions. The two major clades are shown in red and blue and SNPs that differentiate different sub-clades are shown in orange or green. B) Phylogeny of the 8 castor bean accessions based on the identified SNPs. Two major clades, “A” and “B”, are shown separated by 69 SNPs. Members of each sub-clade are indicated in each branch of the phylogeny."
