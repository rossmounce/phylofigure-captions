"pone.0067337.g001.png","Heptanucleotide Signature Based Cladogram.Cladogram derived from heptanucleotide signatures using Euclidean distances between 1,424 sequenced microbes. Terminal branches are color-coded to depict nearest neighbor taxonomic relationships as: strong relationships (same species or same genus) in red, good relationships (phylum or better) in blue, same domain in yellow and different domain in black. This figure shows that heptanucleotide signatures are conserved amongst phylogenetically similar organisms across the tree of life. The tendency for phylogenetically similar organisms to maintain similar oligonucleotide biases is the basis oligonucleotide-based clustering techniques."
