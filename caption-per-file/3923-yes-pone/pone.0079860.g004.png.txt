"pone.0079860.g004.png","Inferred phylogenetic relationship among representative Babesia and Theileria species based on the combined data of 18S rDNA and RPS8 (coding and non-coding regions) gene sequences.The combined data of 18S rDNA and RPS8 (coding and non-coding regions) gene sequences were analyzed utilizing maximum likelihood (ML), using Toxoplasma gondii as outgroup. The numbers along branches indicate bootstrap probability (BP) values. The accession numbers of the isolates used in the phylogenetic tree were listed in Table 1. High statistically supported nodes had BPâ‰¥85; while poorly statistically supported nodes had BP<60."
