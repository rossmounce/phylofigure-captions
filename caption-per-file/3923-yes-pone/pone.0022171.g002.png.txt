Phylogenetic analysis of human and bovine derived Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis. Neighbour-joining phylogenetic tree based on single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis isolates derived from animal and bovine hosts. The ovine derived isolate CLIJ361 was omitted from this analysis due to its significant genetic divergence from the other isolates."
