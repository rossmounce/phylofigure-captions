Phylogenetic analysis of whole genome, penton base, and E3 CR1-β in HAdV-D58. Phylogenetic nalysis is based on the nucleic acid sequence of (A) whole genomes, (B) penton base, and (C) CR1-β. Phylogenetic trees were constructed from aligned sequences using MEGA, via the neighbor-joining methods and a bootstrap test of phylogeny. Bootstrap values shown at the branching points indicate the percentages of 1000 replications produced the clade."
