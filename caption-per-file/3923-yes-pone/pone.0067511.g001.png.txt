L. monocytogenes phylogenetic tree and accessory genome distribution plots.Plots show the number of accessory genes in between each core gene as ordered in the reference strain EGDe. Insertion sites of prophages (P), integrated conjugative elements (ICE), and Listeria genomic islands (LGI) as detailed in Table 4 are indicated above each accessory genome distribution plot. Vertical dotted lines with a question mark indicate prophages, which are not assembled in a single contiguous piece, but are hypothesized to be present in the location based on presence of the appropriate phage genes in unalignable fraction of the assembly. Plots are colored by lineage: I, red, II, blue, III, green, IV, purple. Serotypes are shown to the right of each plot. The phylogenetic tree is based on a maximum likelihood analysis of the concatenated alignments of 2,086 core genes."
