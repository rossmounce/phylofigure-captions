PhyML phylogenies with two independent amino acid datasets show long branch lengths for C. noxius.A. Tree topology of eukaryotic essential genes obtained from distant species. C. noxius is grouped with other arthropods (insects) as highlighted in red. B. Arthropod specific tree, where C. noxius is grouped with other Chelicerata (red), together with two scorpion species from Caraboctonidae and Scorpionidae families. Color code: blue, Hexapoda; purple, Crustacea; pink, Oligostraca; orange, Myriapoda; red, Chelicerata; green, Pycnogonida; black, outgroups (Onychophora; H. sapiens and C. elegans). See Table S2 and Table S3 for full names of the species. LG (A) and JTT (B) models were used, and 1000 bootstrap pseudoreplicates were performed. Bootrstrap support values >500 are shown in both trees."
