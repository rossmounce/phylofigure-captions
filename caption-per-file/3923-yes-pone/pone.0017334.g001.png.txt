"pone.0017334.g001.png","The phylogeny of MEF2 proteins inferred by the neighbor-joining method with Poisson-correction (PC) distance. The scale bar indicates the number of amino acid substitutions per site. The four MEF2 branches in vertebrates are highlighted; bootstrap percentages are indicated on branches supported by a plurality of bootstrap replicates. Leaves are comprised of brief species name and MEF2 type."
