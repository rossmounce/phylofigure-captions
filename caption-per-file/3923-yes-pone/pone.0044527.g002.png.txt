"pone.0044527.g002.png","Phylogeny of termites, redrawn from the Maximum Likelihood analysis of Legendre et al. (2008).Nodes with bootstrap support below 50% were merged. Psammotermes was included in the phylogeny according to its retrieved position in Lo et al. (2004) and Inward et al. (2007). Tree shows the presumed evolution of pseudergates (in green), true workers (in blue) and the yet unknown Psammotermes (in red)."
