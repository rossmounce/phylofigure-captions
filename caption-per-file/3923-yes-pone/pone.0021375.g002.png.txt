HPV16 phylogeny and heatmap of HPV16 isolates in the reference panel. All 62 nucleotide sequences in the HPV16 complete-genome reference panel were aligned and compared to one another. Sequence identity between every pair was measured and represented as a heatmap, scaled such that the minimum inter-sequence identity (97.6%) is displayed as red and the maximum inter-sequence identity (100%) as blue. A Bayesian phylogenetic tree is shown alongside the heatmap to illustrate how the inter-sequence identities relates to the phylogenetic topology. Major lineages (highlighted in gray) and sublineages are labeled and all have 100% bootstrap support."
