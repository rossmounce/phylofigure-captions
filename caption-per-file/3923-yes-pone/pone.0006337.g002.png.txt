The phylogenetic tree generated by Neighbor-Joining method based on the G proteins from all SVCV isolates.Two genogroups, Ia and Id were differentiated by using the p-distance substitution model with bootstrap test of 1,000 replicates. SVCV G proteins isolated in China belong to genogroup Ia which can be further divided into Ia-A and Ia-B sub genogroups. SVCV-C1 belongs to Ia-A subgroup. Country origins of the isolates are shown in the brackets. RV represents the reference virus."
