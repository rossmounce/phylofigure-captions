"pone.0035649.g002.png","ML phylogenetic tree for HIV-1 subtype C pol (PR/RT) sequences circulating in Brazil.The color of a branch represents the geographic region from where the subtype C strain was sampled, according to the legend given in the figure. Brackets indicate the monophyletic clade formed by Brazilian subtype C sequences and the position of subtype C reference sequences of African origin. The box highlights the position of the sub-cluster circulating in Porto Alegre (BR-PA). The aLRT support values are indicated only at key nodes. Horizontal branch lengths are drawn to scale with the bar at the bottom indicating nucleotide substitutions per site. The tree was rooted using HIV-1 subtype A1 and F1 reference sequences."
