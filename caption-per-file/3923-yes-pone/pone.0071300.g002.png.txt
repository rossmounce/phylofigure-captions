"pone.0071300.g002.png","Inferred phylogenetic relationship among the digenean species.Trees were inferred using MrBayes v3.1. A, tree inferred from concatenated nucleotide sequences of 12 protein-coding genes, using the cestode E. granulosus as the outgroup. Posterior support values are given at nodes. See text for more details. B, tree inferred from concatenated amino acid sequences. Only the portion of the tree (members of the order Plagiorchiida) that differs from that in A is shown. C, tree of members of the Plagiorchiida according to phylogeny proposed by Olson et al (2003) [47]."
