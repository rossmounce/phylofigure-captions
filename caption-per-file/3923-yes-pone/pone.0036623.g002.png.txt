Phylogenetic tree of the RyR family.The CmRyR amino acid sequence was aligned to 9 representative RyR isoforms from 7 species and used for phylogenetic analysis. The Neighbor-joining tree was generated in MEGA5 with 1000 bootstrap replicates. RyR sequences are obtained from the following GenBank entries: DJ085056 for Bombyx mori (sRyR); AET09964 for Plutella xylostella (PxRyR); EFN78897 for Harpegnathos saltator (HsRyR); BAA41471 for Drosophila melanogaster (DmRyR); EAT44864 for Aedes aegypti (AaRyR); BAA08309 for Caenorhabditis elegans (CeRyR); CAA33279 for Oryctolagus cuniculus RyR1 (OcRyR1); NP_001076226 for Oryctolagus cuniculus RyR2 (OcRyR2); NP_001076231 for Oryctolagus cuniculus RyR3 (OcRyR3)."
