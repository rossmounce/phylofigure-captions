"pone.0041315.g002.png","Phylogenetic relationships among haplotypes and lineage subdivergence detected in Primula obconica.(a) The phylogenetic topography based on plastid DNA dataset. Bootstrap values of Maximum Parsimony analysis and posterior probabilities of Bayesian inference are given above and below branches, respectively. (b) Maximum Parsimony networks of chlorotypes identified by TCS. Each solid line between circles represents one mutational step between two chlorotypes based on most parsimonious algorithm. The small open circles indicate the missing chlorotypes (not sampled or extinct). The solid line in the middle position of the network represents the two main lineages identified in the phylogenetic analysis, while the dashed line indicates the subdivision in each main lineage. The arrow indicated the connection between Primua obconica and Primula barbicalyx. Yellow and green circles in (a) and (b) correspond to lineage A and lineage B, respectively, as shown in Figure 1. (c) The strict consensus of the Maximum Parsimony trees of ribotypes. The two main lineages are circled by a solid line, while a dashed line in each circle represents the subdivision in each main lineage. The terminal of each branch represents haplotype recovered from plastid DNA and ITS datasets (See Table 1 and 3)."
