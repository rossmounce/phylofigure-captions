"pone.0024344.g002.png","Maximum-likelihood phylogeny reconstructed from the D1 region of the 28S rRNA gene. The DNA substitution model parameters estimated by RAxML were; f(A) 0.26, f(C) 0.24, f(G) 0.33, f(T) 0.17; R(AC) 0.69, R(AG) 2.17, R(AAT) 1.39, R(CG) 0.61, R(CT) 5.12, R(GT) 1.0; alpha 0.61; pinvar 0.36. Sequences produced during this study are in bold. Sampling locations for each taxon are given in Table S1. Other sequences were downloaded from Genbank (Haplosclerida A, AY561856, Haplosclerina C AY561861, Haplosclerina B, AY561860, Haliclona sp, AY561862, H. mucosa, AJ225831, H. fulva, AJ225829, P. ficiformis, AJ225828, A. queenslandica, EF654518, Xestospongia sp., AY561853). Numbers on the branches represent bootstrap proportions/posterior probabilities."
