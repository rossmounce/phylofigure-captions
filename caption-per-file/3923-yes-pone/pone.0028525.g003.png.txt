The tick salivary carboxypeptidase inhibitor family of proteins. (A) Alignment of Amblyomma maculatum, Dermacentor andersoni, and Rhipicephalus bursa proteins. (B) Bootstrapped phylogram (1,000 iterations) resulting from the alignment in (A). The numbers on the nodes indicate the bootstrap support above 50%. The clade indicated by CPI contains the functionally characterized R. bursa protein. The bar at the bottom indicates 10% amino acid divergence. The Dermacentor proteins were deducted from ESTs deposited in DBEST."
