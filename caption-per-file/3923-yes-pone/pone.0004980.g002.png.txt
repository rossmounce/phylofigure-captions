"pone.0004980.g002.png","Genetic map of the puf-A locus of zebrafish, the unrooted phylogenetic tree, computer modeling of human Puf-A and its electrostatic surface representation.(A) Genetic map of the zebrafish puf-A locus and the exon/intron structure of the puf-A transcript were constructed through blasting the puf-A cDNA sequence to the genome databases of the NCBI and Ensembl websites. The puf-A (zgc: 66377) is ENSDARG00000063356 in chromosome 10: 5,373,938 to 5,391,448 (Ensembl 44). (B) The unrooted phylogenetic tree of human (Hs), mouse (Mm) and zebrafish (Dr) Puf proteins. Phylogenetic analysis was performed using the PHYLIP 3.67 package as described in Method. These Puf proteins could be grouped into three clusters: (1) the Puf-A cluster, (2) the C14orf21 cluster, and (3) the PUM1/PUM2 homolog cluster. (C) Modeling the Puf domain of human Puf-A. This model, built by MODELLER 9v3 as described in Methods, represents the corresponding Puf domain for binding with RNA (yellow). This Puf domain of Puf-A contains six Puf repeats distributed in two regions (R1 to 3 and R4 to 6; blue), and each region contains three repeats. The magenta color refers to the middle region of the Puf domain. The N and C terminal ends of this Puf domain are indicated. (D) Electrostatic surface representation of the Puf domain. The electrostatic potentials were calculated by DELPHI as described. The left panel shows the areas on the concave surface with positive potentials (blue) which interacts with RNA (yellow). The right panel represents the convex surface, where the negative potentials are shown mainly as the acidic (red) and a few hydrophobic (white) areas."
