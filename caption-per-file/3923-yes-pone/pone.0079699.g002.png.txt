Relative abundance of major prokaryote groups detected on phylochips.Stacked bar chart represents the percentage of total fluorescence signal detected in each group, based on probe hybridizations. The number of identified genera per condition (n) is indicated in white in the chart. Clusters analysis was performed on taxonomical profiles of each sample at the genus level, and exposed to bootstrap simulation (n = 10000). Approximately unbiased bootstrap p-value are expressed in percentage and indicated at each nod. The grouping was done with the Ward method based on variance analysis, and distances are calculated according a correlation algorithm (the complement 1−r of Pearson’s r correlation). Dendrogram scale is representing the similarity based on the Euclidean distance."
