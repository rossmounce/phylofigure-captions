"pone.0017216.g002.png","pBRP2 factors belong to the TFIIB family. A) Alignment of the core domain of pBRP2 proteins and B-type related factors. Repeats of the core domain are indicated by red boxes. Residues of related proteins that are identical to those of the Arabidopsis pBRP2 protein are highlighted in black, while similar residues are highlighted in gray. B) The phylogenetic tree was inferred from the core domain alignment. At, Arabidopsis thaliana; Bo, Brassica oleracea; Br, Brassica rapa; Os, Oryza sativa; Hs, Homo sapiens; Dm, Drosophila melanogaster; Sp, Schizosaccharomyces pombe."
