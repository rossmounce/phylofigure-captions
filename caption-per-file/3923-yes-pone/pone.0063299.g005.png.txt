Phylogenetic tree of fucosyltransferases (FucTs).In addition to the FucTs of Schistosoma mansoni (Sm), the α2-, α3-, α6- and protein O-FucTs from Caenorhabditis elegans (Ce), Drosophila melanogaster (Dm), Danio rerio (Dr), Mus musculus (Mm), and humans (Hs) were selected to represent the diversity of known, well-characterized FucTs (NCBI accession numbers and references in Table S5), and used to construct a molecular phylogeny rooted on the bifunctional β3-galactosyltransferase/α2-FucT PgtA of Dictyostelium discoideum (Dd). Posterior probabilities ≥50% are indicated at each node, and genetic divergence (substitutions per site) is represented by the scale bar."
