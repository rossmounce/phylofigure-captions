Phylogenetic analysis of 14 nearly full genome sequences of HIV-1 Subtype B from Caribbean countries: Trinidad and Tobago (TT), Dominican Republic (DO), Haiti (HT) and Jamaica (JM).Reference subtype B sequences are indicated by the country of origin; they are: US: MN, JRCSF, SF2, WR27, P896, NY5, BCSG3C, YU2, RF, U23487; DE: D31, HAN; GB: CAM1, study sequences (bold) are identified by name. A neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree was built using the Kimura 2-parameter model and significant parsimony bootstrap values (>70%) were placed next to the nodes. The genetic distance corresponding to the lengths of the branches is shown by the scale below the tree."
