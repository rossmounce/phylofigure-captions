Georgian strains cluster with 2011 European outbreak strains.Phylogenetic comparisons were carried using all core E. coliInset: Phylogenic analysis of subset of most closely related strains using all conserved orthologs. O104:H4 isolates are labeled in blue type; strains sequenced for this study are indicated in red type. Maximum likelihood phylogenies were constructed using RAxML (E. coli-wide tree) or Fasttree (inset) as described in Methods."
