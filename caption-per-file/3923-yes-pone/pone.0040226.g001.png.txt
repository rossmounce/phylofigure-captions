Phylogenetic tree calculated from amino acid sequence alignment of Lon-like proteases (LonC) with representative members of LonA and LonB subfamilies.Three distinct clades can be recognized through phylogenetic reconstruction. Indicated are the names of species where at least one member of the corresponding subfamily of Lon proteases is present. Note that LonA proteases are ubiquitous in all species shown; thus some bacteria, including E. coli, possess more than one subfamilies of Lon. In addition, multiple paralogs related to LonA have been found in certain bacteria. The Lon genes are indicated by binomial names of the species. The accession codes for the genes can be found in Table S1."
