"pone.0031981.g002.png","Split-graph constructed by the neighbor-net method based on 41 complete genomes of TBEV, LIV, LGTV and OHFV. The split-graph focuses on phylogenetic relationships within the Tick-borne encephalitis virus species. The three TBEV subtypes are highlighted in color and the positions of all prototype strains are indicated in bold. Two Russian strains (886–84 and 178–79) were not assigned to any main subtype at this stage. A larger split between LIV and SSEV (in yellow) suggests a recombination event."
