Neighbour-joining phylogenetic tree showing the relationship of representative sequences of OTUs in all snow samples and reference sequences in GenBank.It was constructed based on analysis of 16 S rRNA gene sequences of bacteria clone libraries from snow samples. Clone names from 1 (2010) to 4 (2010) represent samples collected on January 1, March 1, 8, 14, Feb 7 of 2010. Clone name 5 (2011) represents snow samples collected on Feb 27 of 2011. The capital ?C? in the clone name means Clone. An Escherichia coli strain ATCC 25922 (dq 360844.1) was used as the outgroup."
