Phylogenetic analysis of Human Astrovirus strains identified in this study based on the partial ORF2 region (348 bases) encoding outer capsid precursor protein.The reference strains and closest match isolates detected through BLAST are given for genetic comparison. The phylogenetic tree with 500 bootstrap replicates was reconstructed using neighbor joining method and the K-2P model through MEGA 4.0. Serotype-1 strains were compared to four prototype strains (USA-GenBank accession number L23513, isolated in 1994), United Kingdom (GenBank accession number Z25771, isolated in 1990), Japan (GenBank accession number AB009985, isolated in 1997) and Germany (GenBank accession number AY720892). Taxa with arrow head indicates prototype strains within each serotype."
