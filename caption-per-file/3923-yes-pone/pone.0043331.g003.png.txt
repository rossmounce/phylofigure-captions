Maximum likelihood phylogenies of three different types of toxin-like transcripts from C. noxius and other scorpion/spider species taken from ToxProt (bolds).A. Sodium channel modifiers; beta type transcripts are highlighted in red, alpha type in blue and LVPs in green. B. Potassium channel blockers; alpha type transcripts are highlighted in red, beta type in green, gamma type in blue. C. Metalloproteases; venom metalloprotease-like isotigs are highlighted in green, astacin-like in blue and antarease-like in red. 1000 bootstrap pseudoreplicates were performed. Supported bifurcations (bootstrap values >500) are shown."
