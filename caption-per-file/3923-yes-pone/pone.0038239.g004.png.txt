Phylogenetic Analysis and Orthologous Gene Detection.(A) Phylogenetic relationships of consensus sequences of 17 Mycoplasma strains with complete genomic sequences. The phylogenetic groups, mycoides, pneumoniae and hominis, are indicated by M, P and H, respectively. (B) Frequency of orthologous genes within the 13 genomes of different Mycoplasma species included in this analysis are listed in Table 1 (marked with *). The figures 1 to 13 on the right panel represent the number of genomes where the common orthologous genes were found. The rates in different parts of the circle represent the frequency of genes present in a single genome or shared by different genomes. The figures surrounding the circle represent orthologous gene numbers in individual parts. The 39% of genes including 887 present in a single genome represent lineage specific genes, while 10% of the genes including 224 were found in all 13 genomes, which represent the Mycoplasma core genome."
