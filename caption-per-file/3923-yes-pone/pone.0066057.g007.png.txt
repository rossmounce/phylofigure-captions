"pone.0066057.g007.png","Phylogenetic tree based on neighbor-joining analysis of amino acid sequences of arginase from H.fossilis and other organisms. Arginase sequences were aligned using Clustal W and analyzed with the MEGA version 5 (Tamura et al., 2011). The three vertebrate phylogenetic clades are indicated by bars on the right. The GenBank accession numbers for the sequences used are indicated in parentheses."
