"pone.0037567.g002.png","Phylogenetic tree and distribution patterns of the species within the porcini s.s. lineage.Panel A shows the topology inferred from ML analysis using the ITS data. The two values at each node represent the percentage of bootstrap supports (ML)/posterior probabilities (BI). Provisionally adopted names (based on tree topology) and finally accepted names (based on our proposed criterion for phylogenetic species identification) for all taxa are listed. Newly identified phylogenetic species are highlighted by adding asterisks after their names. Three major clades are separately marked with bold lines, and the fourth one is not marked due to its low statistical support values. Panel B lists the distribution patterns of the porcini s.s. as a pie chart. Colors in both panels represent different distribution ranges."
