Mitochondrial diversity of Corsican goats compared to world-wide goats diversity. Ancient (circles) and current (stars) Corsican sequences have been used with 20 sequences of reference corresponding to all haplogroups described up to now [14] to reconstruct a Bayesian phylogenetic tree using a GTR+I+G model of evolution (see text). Only a single sequence by haplotype has been used, so haplotypes in common between medieval and today periods are indicated by both a circle and star. Only posterior probabilities higher than 0.6 are indicated."
