"pone.0021299.g002.png","Phylogenetic tree of Vibrio. A cluster of 8916 orthologues grouped into 28 strains was screened for the presence (red) or absence (black) of genes. A phylogenetic tree was constructed for all strains, and the red line region represents the same category. On the right nucleotide sequences of homologs were used to construct a phylogenetic tree."
