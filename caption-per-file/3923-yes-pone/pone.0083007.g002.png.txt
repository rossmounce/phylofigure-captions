Simiate orthologs.A phylogenetic tree of Simiate. The averaged percentage of identities shared with the human ortholog (=100%) is shown for diverse groups. Please note that bacteria and archaea express GCSHPP (glycine cleavage system H protein, mitochondrial precursor) only, therefore the corresponding numbers refer to the alignment with GCSHPP and are presented in italic letters. Species demonstrating exceptional identity percentages are shown along with the actual percentage in brackets. All orthologs have been identified using the murine isoform as a template. Murine isoform: cDNA sequence BC026590, location: C4B3; 4, GI:124487245. Human isoform: gene FAM206A, location: C9orf6, GI:205277341; current data base status: predicted protein, evidence at transcript level)."
