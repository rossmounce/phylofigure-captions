"pone.0022046.g001.png","Evolutionary relationships of melanocortin receptors from selected vertebrates as presented by Bayesian analysis (A) and Maximum likelihood analysis (B). There are five major branches in these phylogenetic trees, dividing MC1Râ€“5R into individual branches (distinct colors). The MC receptors from basal fishes are included in this phylogenetic tree such as MC A receptor (MCAR, ABB36647.1) and MC B receptor (MCBR, ABB36648.1) from lamprey Lampetra fluviatilis and corresponding genes from Petromyzon marinus, and MC receptors - MC1R (AAVX01456471.1) MC3R (AAVX01131452.1) and MC5R (AAVX01069419.1) from elephant shark C. milii. Outgroup in these phylogenetic trees is melanocortin like protein (MCRL) from B. floridae (JGI accession id - e_gw.70.133.1)."
