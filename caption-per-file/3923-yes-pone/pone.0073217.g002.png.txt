Bayesian inference phylogenetic tree based on Hsp90 protein sequences from Arthropoda.Species in which multiple hsp90 genes have been detected are in dark blue. Filled diamonds denote putative species-specific duplication events predicted by this study. Filled squares denote duplication events in the common ancestor of a wide taxonomic group (e.g. Pleocyemata), predicted by this study. Filled circle shows the gain of type 2 isoform in Hymenoptera; empty-strikethrough circle shows loss of type 1 isoform in Formicidae. Numbers at nodes represent Posterior Probability (PP) values. Scale bar: substitutions/site."
