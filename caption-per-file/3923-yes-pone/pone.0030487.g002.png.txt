"pone.0030487.g002.png","Molecular characteristics and proportion from different regions of Argentina of dominant community methicillin-resistant-Staphylococcus aureus clones. A. PFGE pattern analysis for representative isolates belonging to the most prevalent subtypes of community-onset-MRSA clones (CA-MRSA and HA-MRSA) detected in central, eastern and northern regions of Argentina during 2007–2008. The schematic presentation of SmaI restriction patterns (middle) and dendrogram (left) by the unweighted-pair group method using average linkage clusterings are shown. Genotypes are denoted as subtype (by PFGE)-ST (by MLST)-SCCmec type-spa type (right). CA-MRSA clones appear in gray. The presence (+) or absence (−) of pvl genes (by PCR) is also indicated for each subtype; strains with and other without pvl genes belonging to the same PFGE subtype (I9) are indicated as /−. The PFGE pattern of USA300-0114 (ST8-IVa-t008-ACME+) is shown for comparison purposes. The first (A1-ST5-I-t149-Cordobes/Chilean), second (B1-ST239-IIIA-t037-Brazilian) and third (C1-ST100-IVNv-t002-Pediatric) more frequent HA-MRSA clones in our country, detected among community-onset MRSA infections, are also shown (dotted gray). B: Proportion of CA-MRSA clones among representative isolates from different regions of Argentina in 2007."
