"pone.0014547.g003.png","Fish-centric models of DIA1-family evolution.In both models (A and B), the genome of the hypothetical chordate ancestor encodes two DIA1-family genes: DIA1 and DIA1L. The DIA1L gene has been ‘lost’ in the urochordate/vertebrate lineage, preceding the 1/2R whole genome duplications (WGDs). A duplicated copy of DIA1, which we have called DIA1R, was retained subsequent to the 1/2R WGD event, with both DIA1 and DIA1R identified in lamprey, fish, and tetrapod genomes. In the fish lineage, however, two different models, (A) and (B), could account for our current knowledge of DIA1 family members. In model (A), the DIA1 duplication generating DIA1a and DIA1b coincides with the 3R WGD. Two lineage-specific ‘losses’ of DIA1a have then occurred: the first in the G. morhua lineage, and the second in the Protacanthopterygian/Acathopterygian lineage. There are too few data available to determine whether the channel catfish encodes DIA1a, DIA1b, both, or neither. In model (B), the DIA1 duplication leading to DIA1a and DIA1b in ostariophysans does not coincide with 3R but, instead, is specific to the ostariophysan lineage. Both model (A) and (B) both predict DIA1R gene loss in the acanthopterygian lineage. Proposed rounds of WGD [43], [164], [165] are indicated by filled black spheres: numbering of the WGDs is provide in black boxes: those occurring early in the vertebrate lineage marked as 1R/2R and that in the ray-finned fish lineage marked as 3R. Proposed duplications of DIA1-family genes are indicated by red circles, and ‘loss’ of DIA1-family genes by grey squares. Data for the schematic fish phylogeny were from numerous sources [162], [166]–[169]."
