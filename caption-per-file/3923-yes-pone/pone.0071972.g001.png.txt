Molecular epidemiology of HIV-1 infections in Koforidua, Ghana.HIV-1 subtypes of 101 isolates were determined through the construction of phylogenetic trees, similarity plotting, and boot-scanning analyses. (A) Phylogenetic tree containing our 75 isolates classified into known subtypes and CRFs. (B) Phylogenetic tree containing our 26 URF isolates identified with unknown mosaic patterns of the pol gene. Two clusters of URF isolates are represented by #1 and #2. (C) Summary on the chimeric patterns of 26 URF isolates. The trees were constructed by the neighbor-joining method. Bootstrap values were calculated from 1,000 analyses, and values greater than 70% are shown at tree nodes. Our isolates are represented by colored circles, and subtype reference isolates are represented by their subtype and name. Scale bar represents nucleotide substitutions per site. HIV-1 group O isolate, ANT70, was used as the outgroup. CRF, circulating recombinant form; PR, protease; RT, reverse transcriptase; and URF, unique recombinant form."
