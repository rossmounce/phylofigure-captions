"pone.0036995.g005.png","Dendrogram presentation of the 245 distinct CRISPOL types detected among 2,200 isolates of S. enterica serotype Typhimurium or its monophasic variant of antigenic formula 1,4,[5],12:i:-.Black squares indicate presence of the spacer, as detected by the corresponding probe, whereas white indicates an absence of the spacer. For the determination of CRISPOL types (CTs), each of the 68 spacers was treated as a numerical character indicating absence (0) or presence (1 for all spacers except BraB14, for which an arbitrary value of 10 was assigned) in BioNumerics 6.5 software (Applied Maths, Sint-Martens-Latem, Belgium). Similarities between CTs were assessed by calculating the Pearson product-moment, and a dendrogram was constructed by the unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean (UPGMA). The four SNP-variant spacers targeted by probes 69 to 72 are shown but were excluded from the phylogenetic analysis, as they were not independent. A indicates a group of profiles derived from CT1, the main type of emerging monophasic isolates. B indicates a group of profiles derived from CT21, which is associated with multidrug-resistant DT104 serotype Typhimurium isolates. C indicates a group of serotype Typhimurium isolates of ST36 that may have one or two specific spacers on the leader side of CRISPR1 (BraB14) and CRISPR2 (STMB35)."
