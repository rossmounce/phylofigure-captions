"pone.0014357.g007.png","Phylogenetic comparison of IAPV sequences detected in honeybees and non-Apis hymenopteran pollinators collected near IAPV(+) apiaries.An unrooted maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree of IAPV (based on 771-nt for capsid region) was generated using a region of the structural proteins of the virus. The support for the indicated branching topology was evaluated by using bootstrap re-sampling of the sequences 1,000 times. Nodes supported by bootstrap values over 70 are given. Strains were annotated by genus, species, identification label, country of isolation and year of isolation. Green =  virus from non-Apis hymenopteran pollinators; Black  =  virus sequences from original isolation and honey bees from CCD-affected operations [16]. Non-Apis hymenopteran pollinators collected from same local are indicated by common symbol following sample label."
