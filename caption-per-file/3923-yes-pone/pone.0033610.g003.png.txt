"pone.0033610.g003.png","Maximum likelihood trees based on ITS-1 (A) and COI (B) nucleotide sequences obtained in this study. Trees show phylogenetic analyses of 10 individual midges morphologically identified as C. schultzei complex (BE1-5, NU1-5) and 2 C. imicola (BE6, NU6) collected from two sites together with most related published sequences.GenBank accession numbers are shown for each sequence. Midges were named by collection site (NU - Neve Ur, BE - Beit Elazari) with index numbers. Bootstrap values are shown on the branches."
