Phylogram of concatenated DNA polymerase and DNA topoisomerase I poxvirus sequences.Using published sequences and those from this study, the regions of DNA polymerase and DNA topoisomerase I amplified by PCR (without the primer sequences) were concatenated, aligned and a PhyML phylogram generated. Bootstrap values of branches have been shown if greater than 50. Cetacean samples with 100% nucleotide identity have been shown as one tip. The Chordopoxvirinae genera are shown with the proposed new cetacean genus."
