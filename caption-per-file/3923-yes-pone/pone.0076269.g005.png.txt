Microbiota signature of bacteria associated with intact versus disrupted colonization resistance to Clostridium difficile.(A) Phylogenetic tree display of the bacteria identified from stool samples of 8 vancomycin-treated patients with intact (i.e., C. difficile growth suppressed) or disrupted (i.e., C. difficile growth supported) colonization resistance based on the invitro colonization assay. Clades of bacteria that significantly support or suppress C. difficile growth are highlighted in green or red, respectively. Circle diameter at each phylogenetic level is proportional to the corresponding taxonâ€™s abundance. (B) Histogram of the Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) score of key bacteria abundance in suppressive and supportive groups arranged according to their effect size. Positive (green bars) and negative (red bars) LDA scores represent supportive and suppressive bacteria, respectively."
