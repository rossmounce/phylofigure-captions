"pone.0010785.g002.png","BLASTP result distribution across fosmids 7–14 and 7–25.a) The X-axis indicates genera with at least 10 BLASTP hits throughout the ORFeome of the analyzed fosmids. Using a previously published approach [33] the organism distribution on a genus level was identified for each coding gene, e-values were grouped into ranges, and threshold levels were defined for minimum overall frequency. Genera are phylogenetically sorted. The Y-axis indicates respective e-value ranges. The frequency of hits for each genus in each e-value range (log scale) is shown by color coding and corresponding values are indicated in the figure. All BLASTP hits per genus per ORF were accepted. b) Same as a), except that custom databases of species from phylogenetically defined Clostridium clusters were used."
