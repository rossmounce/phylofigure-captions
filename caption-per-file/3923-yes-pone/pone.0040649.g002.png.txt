Unrooted Neighbor-Joining and Bayesian phylogenetic tree of HES/HEY genes.The trees were inferred by the Neighbor-Joining (NJ) with JTT model (A) and Bayesian (B) based on amino acid sequences of the bHLH and Orange domains. Colors denote different subgroups of HES/HEY, crimson: HEY1/2/L, dark green: V-DEC1/2, deep yellow: HESL, cyaneous: HES1/4, red: HES3, pink: HES6, prasinous: HES2, light blue: HES7, purple: HES5. Some species specific HES clusters including NvHES, DmHES, and BfHES were in black. Numbers in brackets refer to the numbers of the sequences in these species specific clusters. Nv, Dm and Bf are the abbreviations of Nematostella vectensis, Drosophila melanogaster and Branchiostoma floridae."
