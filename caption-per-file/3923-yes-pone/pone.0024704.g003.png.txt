"pone.0024704.g003.png","Contrasting a functional phylogeny built using shared gene families with a 16S gene sequence phylogeny. 1,107 sequenced microbes clustered using (A) the cooccurence of COG orthologous gene families (see Figure 2) or (B) 16S gene sequence similarity (using Muscle and FastTree [35]). Phyla from the NCBI Taxonomy are indicated by color. While overall organismal similarities are maintained at both the functional and sequence levels, the two phylogenies provide distinct perspectives on organismal relatedness. Some clades like the Archaea and Firmicutes form very distinct sub-trees, whereas others like Bacteroidetes/Chlorobi, Actinobacteria and Cyanobacteria show high 16S similarity relative to their functional similarity."
