"pone.0004814.g001.png","Phylogenetic analysis of 67 partial pol sequences of HIV-1 from Caribbean countries: Trinidad and Tobago (TT), Dominican Republic (DO), Haiti (HT) and Jamaica (JM).A neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree was built using the Kimura 2-parameter model and significant parsimony bootstrap values (>70%) were placed next to the nodes. The genetic distance corresponding to the lengths of the branches is shown by the scale below the tree. Reference samples are those named, preceded by the subtype; one of the study samples (the B/C recombinant) is also named."
