The mouse Mup gene cluster.Black arrows indicate direction of coding genes, numbered beneath, in the mouse genome. White arrows indicate direction of pseudogenes. Gaps in the genome are indicated by black triangles. The genes are arranged in two classes based on phylogeny, Class A in open brackets and Class B shaded grey. Genes expressed in male C57BL/6J liver and submaxillary glands indicated by black arrows, by RNA expression analysis."
