"pone.0040050.g008.png","Dating estimates for the origins of cotton leaf curl begomovirus-associated satellites.Dated phylogeny of the Rep (panel-A) and Î²C1 (panel-B) proteins of alphasatellites and betasatellites, respectively, associated with CLCuD. The sequences were selected on the basis of prior information from pairwise comparisons and phylogenetic trees presented in Figures 5 and 6. The trees were automatically rooted through uncorrelated relaxed LogNormal clock model in BEAST program (V1.6). The years of divergence are shown on bases of each node. For panel A the groups as sequences labeled I to IV are discussed in the text. For panel B the cotton species from which betasatellites obtained here were isolated are shown on the right."
