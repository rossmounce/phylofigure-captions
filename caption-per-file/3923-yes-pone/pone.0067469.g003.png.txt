Phylogenetic tree constructed by maximum likelihood method based on the amino acid sequences of c-type lysozymes from invertebrate animals.Numbers at the forks indicate the bootstrap values (in %) out of 100 replicates. The sequences of c-type lysozymes from vertebrate animals (Scophthalmus rhombus, Bos Taurus, Homo sapiens) were used as an out-group. Bootstrap value <50 are not shown. The sequences used to construct phylogeny trees of c-type lysozymes are shown in Table 1."
