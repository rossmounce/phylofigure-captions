"pone.0051172.g001.png","Phylogenetic tree based on spa type of S. aureus IE isolates from 1999 and 2008 surveys.Figure 1. Circular representation of the phylogenetic tree obtained using UPGMA method (http://spa.ridom.de/). The spa types were clustered into CCs (ie, spaCCs) by use of the integrated BURP (Based Upon Repeat Patterns) algorithm. User-definable parameters were set as follows: “cluster spa types into spaCC if cost distances are less than or equal to 4” and “exclude spa types shorter than 5 repeats.” This parameter combination ensures optimal concordance (95.3%) between BURP and e- BURST (http://spa.ridom.de/). Only major spaCC are represented."
