HIV Inter-Host and Human Flu H3N2 Phylogeny Trees.Inferred phylogeny of the HIV-1, subtype B virus at a geographical global scale (Env gene, region C2V5) (Left), and the Human Influenza A Virus (haemagglutinin gene HA), subtype H3N2, at the same scale (Right). Details on the inference method used are reported in the main text. In each phylogenetic tree, we use a color code to visually identify viruses isolated in the same temporal interval. For example, we colored in red all the branches of leaves isolated between 2000 and 2005 for the HIV-1 virus (left), while, for instance, blue is used in the phylogenetic tree of Human Flu (right) to mark all the leaves isolated in the year 2001. In the phylogenetic tree of the Human Flu, leaves isolated in the same temporal interval cluster in the same clade and there is just one evolutionary lineage, the so called “Trunk” (marked in grey), connecting all of them. These patterns are not observed in the phylogenetic tree of the HIV-1 virus. The tree of the Human-Flu H3N2, moreover, is visibly much more imbalanced with the respect to the HIV-1 one. Details on the definition of the imbalance level and its quantification are in the main text."
