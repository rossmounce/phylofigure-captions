"pone.0092107.g004.png","Phylogenetic analysis of ApIV with respect to viruses belonging to Iflaviridae as well as representative viruses from and the Dicistroviridae and the Picornaviridae (outgroup).The phylogeny is based on a concatenated 328 amino acid sequence combining the conserved domains of the helicase, protease and RdRp regions and was inferred by Maximum Likelihood using the JTT matrix-based model [39] as implemented by MEGA5 [40]. The tree with the highest log likelihood is shown. The percentage of trees in which the associated taxa clustered together is shown next to the branches. The full names and GenBank accession numbers of the viruses used are shown in Table S1."
