Neighbor joining phylogenetic tree generated using nucleotide sequences of the HPV-58 L2 gene.Study sequences are labeled in black. Others are standard sequences, including: D90400 (Japan), EU918765, HQ537760 (isolate AS347), HQ537762, HQ537763, HQ537776, HQ537774, and HQ537777. Phylogenetic trees were constructed by the Neighbor-Joining method and the Kimura 2-Parameter model by MEGA package."
