"pone.0094172.g002.png","Neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree of plant HMGR proteins.The tree was constructed based on a complete protein sequence alignment of HMGR genes using neighbor-joining method, and the PpHMGRs and SmHMGR were designated as outgroups. Numbers at the nodes represent bootstrap support (1000 replicates). Bootstrap support higher than 40% is indicated at respective nodes."
