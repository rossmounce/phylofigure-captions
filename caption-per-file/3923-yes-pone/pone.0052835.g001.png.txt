Unrooted phylogram of fimbrial usher proteins identified in Escherichia.A total of 1075 amino acid positions were used to infer the evolutionary relationship of 383 aligned usher proteins. These consist of 379 usher amino acid sequences belonging to intact fimbrial gene clusters and an additional four usher amino acid sequences of disrupted fimbrial gene clusters (Yhc and AAF/II), which lack intact representatives in the genome sequenced strains examined in this dataset. The corresponding 383 fimbrial gene clusters can be classified as 38 types based on the evolutionary phylogeny of usher amino acid sequence and genetic locus position. Fimbrial gene clusters were grouped according to the Nuccio clade system (?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, open circles represent cladistic nodes) [3], and highlighted in colour. The text of fimbrial types located on PAI's or plasmids is highlighted in blue and red, respectively. Bootstrap values (1000) are displayed as percentage on major nodes. The scale represents the number of amino acid substitutions per site."
