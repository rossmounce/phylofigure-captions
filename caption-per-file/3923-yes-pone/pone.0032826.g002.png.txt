Bayesian phylogeny inferred from the 1st and 2nd codon positions of the 13 mitochondrial protein-coding genes. Because most of the maximum likelihood values differed very little from the posterior probabilities, branches are labeled with a single number for reading clarity. Most are maximum likelihood bootstrap proportions (regular text) but are replaced by posterior probabilities (bold italics) for branches with a difference of more than five between the two values. Branches are color-coded based on order-level taxonomic affiliations."
