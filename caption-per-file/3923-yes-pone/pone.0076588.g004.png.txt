Evidence of symbiotic nitrogen-reducing associations between weevils and bacteria.(A) Nitrogen-fixing activity measured by acetylene reduction assay for adult weevils and larvae; rates calculated after blank subtraction of autoclaved samples (one-way ANOVA, F?=?8.61; P<0.001, n?=?16). (B) Amount of ethylene accumulated over time in live weevil larvae compared to autoclaved larvae as a control. (C) Rooted maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree based on nifH sequence analysis of nitrogen-fixing bacteria associated with the weevil Conorhynchus pistor. Scale bar indicates 10% estimated sequence divergence. Azotobacter vinelandiii was used as the outgroup. Values above and below branches indicate likelihood bootstrap support. Only bootstrap values greater than 70% are shown."
