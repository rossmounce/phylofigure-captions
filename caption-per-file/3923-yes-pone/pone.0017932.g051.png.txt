"pone.0017932.g051.png","Single most parsimonious tree resulting from the phylogenetic analysis. Primary analysis included 177 characters evaluated for 18 taxa (Length  =  325 steps; CI  =  0.60; RI  =  0.66; RCI  =  0.39). Bootstrap values >50% are to the left of the nodes; Bremer support values >1 are to the right. The open circle represents Carnosauria; the closed circle represents Allosauroidea. The arrow shows the number of steps needed to remove Acrocanthosaurus from its current position within Carcharodontosauridae and place it as the sister taxon to Allosaurus, a relationship proposed by previous authors (Figure 33)."
