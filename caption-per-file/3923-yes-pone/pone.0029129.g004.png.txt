Phylogenetic analysis of HA gene of Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 strains isolated from Urban (blue) and peri-urban (green) sites from Delhi region, North India in Aug 2009 or 2010. The representative strains from 2009/A/California(H1N1) strain and from other parts of the world and India (Orange) were used to generate the phylogenetic tree. The characteristic amino acids unique to clade 7 (S203T) is shown at the root of the branch."
