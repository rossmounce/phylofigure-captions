"pone.0034440.g003.png","Phylogenetic analysis of NOX5. Phylogenetic analysis of NOX5 gene based on the schematic phylogeny of organisms created using multiple alignments of the putative amino acid sequence of rabbit NOX5 and deduced amino acid sequences retrieved from the GenBank database. The Tree was reconstructed following NCBI BLAST by the neighbor-joining method. Our rabbit NOX5 sequence (JF723383) is shown as the unknown query."
