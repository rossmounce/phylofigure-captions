"pone.0072295.g001.png","Phylogenetic analyses of the SHIVSF162P3 and SHIV-1157ipd3N4 env gene.The unrooted neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree from the full-length envelope gene was built using the MEGA5.1 software, and the numbers at each node represent bootstrap value (1000 replicates). Bootstrap values on branches are shown for the maximum neighbor-joining analyses. Reference samples were obtained from the Los Alamos National laboratory HIV database (http://hiv-web.lanl.gov/)."
