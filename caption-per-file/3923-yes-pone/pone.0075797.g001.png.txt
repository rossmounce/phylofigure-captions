"pone.0075797.g001.png","Maximum likelihood (ML) consensus tree from concatenated (rrs gyrB rpoB rpoD) sequences of nectar-inhabiting Pseudomonas isolates.Bootstrap percentages from ML analysis are shown above lines, and clades with Bayesian posterior probabilities ?0.9 are indicated by thick brown lines. The small phylogram is included to illustrate branch length heterogeneity (scale bar?=?0.1 nucleotide substitutions per site). The geographic origin of isolates is shown on the leaves: Mediterranean, filled squares; South African, empty squares. Plant hosts and their corresponding families are also indicated, with abbreviations for the latter shown in parentheses. Insect pollinators associated to each plant species are listed in Table S4.
