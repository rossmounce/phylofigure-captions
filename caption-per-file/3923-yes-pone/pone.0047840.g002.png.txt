"pone.0047840.g002.png","The four VELVET proteins of B. cinerea.(A) Phylogenetic tree of VELVET proteins of B. cinerea, A. nidulans and F. fujikuroi. Sequence alignment and tree construction were performed using the bioinformatics program at Phylogeny.fr (http://www.phylogeny.fr/). Analysed sequences are: B. cinerea BcVEL1B05.10 (HE977589), BcVEL2B05.10 (HE977591), BcVEL3B05.10 (HE977592), BcVEL4B05.10 (HE977594), A. nidulans VeA (AAD42946), VelB (ABQ17967), VelC (ABQ17968), VosA (ABI51618), F. fujikuroi VEL1 (CBE54373), VEL2 (CBK25977), and VEL3 (L. Studt and B. Tudzynski, unpublished data). The sequence alignment of BcVEL1 with other homologous protein sequences is shown in Fig. S2A. (B) Expression of the four VELVET-like genes during different stages of the life cycle of B. cinerea. Wild-type strain B05.10 was incubated on complete medium covered with cellophane overlays for the indicated time periods in continuous light (LL) and light-dark (LD) for induction of conidiation and in continuous darkness (DD) for induction of sclerotia formation (non-pigmented sclerotia initials were present after 6 d of incubation). Infected plant material (primary leaves of P. vulgaris, harvested 2 dpi and 4 dpi) was used to detect the transcripts in planta (IP). rRNA is shown as loading control. (C) Domain architecture of the four identified VELVET-like proteins of B. cinerea. Putative nuclear localization signals (NLS) are shown as green bars, leucine-rich nuclear export signals (NES) as blue bars, and potential PEST domains (proline (P), glutamate (E), serine (S) and threonine (T)-rich) are indicated as orange bars."
