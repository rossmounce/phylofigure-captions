Single most parsimonious tree (length = 408,192 steps, consistency index = 0.647 and retention index = 0.648) recovered from the phylogenetic analysis of the 358 orthologues across 51 taxa. The topology is identical to the maximum likelihood tree recovered by RAxML. Values above the nodes are standard bootstrap re-sampling and partition bootstrap values, respectively, and below the nodes are likelihood bootstrap values. Solid black circles denote nodes with bootstrap support ≥90% for all three support measures."
