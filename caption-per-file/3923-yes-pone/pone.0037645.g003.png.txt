Realigning serine protease using LoCo.(A) Region of high local covariation and good conservation from alignment BB40047 from the BAliBASE 3 benchmarking dataset [4]. Five highlighted sequences do not show conservation of the disulphide bonded cysteine shown structurally in panel C. (B) Realignment of region from panel A using local covariation as a guide. (C) Structural validation of the alignment from panel B built in Cn3D [39]. Positions homologous to those shown in panels A and B are coloured by identity; the conserved disulphide bond is highlighted in orange. (D) Neighbour joining tree of high local covariation segment shown in panel A. Potentially misaligned sequences (indicated by arrows) cluster in a clade joined to the remainder by a long branch. (E) Neighbour joining tree based on realigned segment in B shows realigned sequences no longer cluster together as expected by the phylogenetic relationship of the organisms."
