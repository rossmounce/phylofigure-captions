New proposed scheme for GapC1 evolution.A. The original GapC1 gene was established in a common ancestor of stramenopiles and alveolates [including dinoflagellates and aplicomplexans plus Chromera (designated as apicomplexans+); ciliates are excluded in this figure] shown by an arrowhead. Photosynthetic stramenopiles and apicomplexans+ possessed the vertically transferred GapC1 genes. The ancestral dinoflagellates replaced the “vertical” GapC1 gene by a laterally acquired homologue from an unknown stramenopile species. We also assume two lateral GapC1 gene transfer events — one between an unknown stramenopile species and the ancestral cryptophyte cells, and the other between an unknown member of apicomplexan+ and the ancestral haptophyte cells. The three LGT events were highlighted by red arrows. Putative replacements of plastid-targeted GAPDH took place after the lateral gene transfers (black arrows). The original type of plastid-targeted GAPDH enzymes in a common ancestor of cryptophytes and haptophytes remains uncertain. The homologues belonging to Clade A in the GapC1 phylogeny (Figure 1) are shown in green, while those belonging to Clade B are shown in orange. The host (or organismal) phylogeny is shown grey shading. In this figure, the host monophyly of haptophytes, cryptophytes, stramenopiles, and alveolates are not assumed. B. The same scheme as shown in A but assuming a host monophyly of haptophytes, cryptophytes, stramenopiles, and alveolates. The original GapC1 gene was established in a common ancestor of the four groups (arrowhead). Under this assumption, a common ancestor of cryptophytes and haptophytes originally utilized the “vertical” GapC1 genes."
