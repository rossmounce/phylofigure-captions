Maximum clade credibility phylogeny of human H1N1 influenza virus HA segment with unadjusted sampling dates.The topologies of (A) a chronogram in which branch lengths represent time and (B) a phylogram in which branch lengths represent nucleotide substitutions are identical. Avian and swine influenza virus lineages were removed for ease of viewing. Arrows indicate the lineage leading to the re-emergent HIN1 clade; boxes designate the re-emergent H1N1 clade."
