Clustering of individual axillary samples analyzed by means of DGGE, where 69% of the subjects clustered into the Staphylococcus cluster and 31% into the Corynebacterium cluster.Right: Subject indices from S1 till S53 (not all subjects were shown); gender of the subject; pyrosequenced samples indicated with MID (multiplex identifiers). Above: Identified band: bands A were identified as Staphylococcus epidermidis (100% identity), bands B were identified as Staphylococcus spp. (99% identity), bands C were identified as Staphylococcus hominis (100% identity), bands D and E were identified as Proteobacteria (from pyrosequencing results), band G was identified as Corynebacterium spp. (99% identity), bands H were identified as Corynebacterium spp. (99% identity), and bands F, I, J and K were identified as Corynebacterium spp. (from pyrosequencing results). Left: Clustering of the samples, based on Pearson correlation and unweighted pair group with mathematical averages dendrogram method. Under: indication of GC% of the bacterial bands. Firmicutes have a low GC%, and bands are generally situated left on the gel; Actinobacteria have a high GC%, with bands situated generally on the right side of the gel."
