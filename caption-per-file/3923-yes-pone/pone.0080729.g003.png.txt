"pone.0080729.g003.png","Phylogenetic tree of mating type transcription factors.Maximum likelihood of amino acid sequences of SexM and SexP analysed with the LG+G+F (with four distinct gamma categories) phylogenetic model of mating type HMG-box proteins. The Rhizophagusspp. sequences are highlighted in blue, mucoralean SexM sequences in green, and SexP in orange. The ascomycotan, basidiomycotan, as well as the human outgroup sequences are in black. The numbers at branches correspond to bootstrap support values generated with 1,000 bootstrap replicates. As previously described [21,56], internal nodes are not statistically supported due to high evolutionary rates of mating type proteins [57], leading to poorly supported topologies. However, the R. irregularis sequences s12765 and mucoralean SexP proteins fall into the same clade, while other Rhizophagusspp. sequences are grouped together in the star-shaped cluster with mucoralean SexM and other fungal domains mating type proteins."
