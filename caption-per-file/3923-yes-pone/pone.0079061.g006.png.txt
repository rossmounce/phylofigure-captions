hylotyping.An unrooted phylogenomic tree based on 287 loci from 1095 sequenced bacterial genomes was made as a skeletal tree on which was placed the lepA and gyrB sequences from 16 bacterial cultures isolated from the digestive system of four different 3rd instar larvae from female parent 2 from the North Carolina population. This analysis placed the isolates sister to (A) Providencia stuartii, (B) Enterobacter cloacae, (C) Pusillimonas, (D) Pedobacter heparinus, and (E) Lysinibacillus sphaericus."
