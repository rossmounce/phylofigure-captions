Phylogenetic relationship among EV71 strains isolated in mainland China and those downloaded from GenBank.The total 562 EV71 strains were isolated in mainland China from 1998 to 2010 and other genogroup A, genogroup B and subgenogroup C1, C2, C3, C5 strains were downloaded from GenBank. The phylogenetic tree was generated by using the neighbor-joining method based on alignment of complete VP1 gene sequences. The bootstrap values of 1000 replicates for major branches are displayed as numbers at the nodes. Strains isolated in Shenzhen from 1998 to 2004 were marked by the sombol â€¢."
