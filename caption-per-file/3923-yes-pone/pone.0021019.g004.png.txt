"pone.0021019.g004.png","Coffea species tree. The tree is shown rooted with the outgroup representative Psilanthus ebracteolatus. The geographic origin of species is shown in the color-coded symbols (African species in red, Madagascan species in blue, Psilanthus in black). Species with filled symbols are self-incompatible (SI; e.g. C. canephora), and species with open symbols are self-compatible (SC; e.g. C. arabica). The phylogenetic relationships presented here are summarized from the results of previously published phylogenetic studies in the genus based on chloroplast and nuclear sequence data [30], [31]."
