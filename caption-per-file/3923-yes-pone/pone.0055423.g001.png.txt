"pone.0055423.g001.png","Neighbour joining tree combining 24 loci MIRU-VNTR and spoligotyping data.Neighbour joining tree (left panel) based on the copy numbers of 24 loci MIRU-VNTR (right panel, spoligotyping results whereby a repeat region's presence or absence is indicated by a black box or white box respectively) of the 73 strains investigated. The tree was calculated using the MIRU-VNTRplus server (Distance Measure: Dc: Cavalli-Sforza and Edwards, 1967: Dc [15]). Seven lineages were identified including 71 out of the 73 strains (97%), while two strains could not be allocated to a strain family. Classification of the strains into the different phylogenetic lineages is visualized by color coding, key on Figure 2."
