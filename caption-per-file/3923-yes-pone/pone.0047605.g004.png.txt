Maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees for two fragments of the 56 out of 57 viral quasispecies for subject 510 as identified by SimPlot analysis. Fig. 4A: In subject 510, the majority (56 of 57) of viral quasispecies were comprised of subtype D (light blue bar) and unclassified regions (back bar). A breakpoint is located at position 7,226 (HXB2 numbering). Bootscanning was performed on the alignment by SimPlot v 3.5.1 using Kimura 2-parameter model with sliding window size 350 bp and step increment 3 bp and Kimura 2-parameter distance model. A bootstrap value ≥80% was considered significant. Bootstrap values are indicated on the y axis and nucleotide positions in the alignment are shown on the x axis. Figs. 4B & 4C: Phylogenetic analysis (ML trees) of two fragments identified by the breakpoint located at position 7,226 (HXB2 numbering). After SimPlot analysis the breakpoint was visualized in the alignment by BioEdit. Fig. 4B is a ML tree of the fragment classified as HIV-1 subtype D and Fig. 4C is a ML tree of the unclassified fragment whose subtype classification was unresolved by bootscan analysis. The unclassified region clustered with none of the HIV-1 reference subtypes from the Los Alamos HIV Sequence Database. The viral quasispecies of subject 510 are shown in light blue, and the legend at the right of the bootscan plot indicates reference HIV-1 subtypes. The aLRT values ≥0.95 were considered significant and are shown by asterisk (*). Selected aLRT values are shown at the branch node of the tree. Scale at the bottom of the Figure corresponds to 0.1 nucleotide substitutions per site."
