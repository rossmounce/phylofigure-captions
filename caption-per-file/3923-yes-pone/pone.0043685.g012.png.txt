Radial phylogenetic tree of AChBP, ACCBP and AChR-LBD.Sequences of gastropod AChBP and ACCBP polypeptides (marked in red) are compared here to sequences of gastropod AChR-LBD polypeptides (marked in black). Sequences from the pearl oyster P. fucata, the polychaete annelid C. telata and the electric ray T. marmorata are also included (marked in blue). Nodes bootstrap-supported above 900 are indicated by a circle, those above 990 are additionally marked by an asterisk (1000 replicas were calculated). Note that the gastropod AChBP complex is clearly separated from the gastropod nAChR-LBD complex. Also note that BgAChBP1 and BgAChBP2 show a clear sister-group relationship, suggesting that they arose from a gene duplication event that occurred within the Planorbidae. The neighbor-joining method implemented in Clustal W was applied. A corresponding identity matrix is shown in Table 2.
