Epitope mapping of LmrCD-specific DARPins by ELISA.(A) Analysis of the LmrCD-specific DARPins by a competition ELISA. Binding of bLmrCDAviC to immobilized Myc-tagged DARPins was competed with an excess of DARPins devoid of Myc-tag. (B) Schematic drawing of the four proposed binding epitopes on LmrCD recognized by the LmrCD-selective DARPins based on the results of the competition ELISA shown in (A). The number of the epitopes follows the numbering in the main text. (C) The phylogenetic tree of the LmrCD-specific DARPins corresponds well with the proposed binding epitopes. The branches of the phylogenetic tree are highlighted with the color code used to label the four suggested binding epitopes in (B)."
