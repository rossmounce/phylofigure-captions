"pone.0015488.g002.png","Maximum likelihood phylogeny of X. fastidiosa showing U.S. X. fastidiosa subsp. fastidiosa sequence types (STs) nested within the Costa Rican STs. The circle encompasses all X. fastidiosa subsp. fastidiosa STs. The other subspecies are named on their ancestral branch. All unique STs are shown from 83 U.S. and 24 Costa Rican (CR) samples of subsp. fastidiosa and 21 US samples of subsp. sandyi. The number of isolates/ST is shown by xN. All CR isolates were from coffee except 3 from grape (designated by “grp”). X. fastidiosa subspp. multiplex and pauca are represented by a sample of sequence types (see Table 1). All bootstrap values >80% are shown and the scale bar defines 1% sequence divergence."
