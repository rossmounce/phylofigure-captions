Bayesian tree of Diptera, inferred from a mitochondrial data set comprising 13 protein-coding genes (without third codon sites) and 2 ribosomal RNA genes.The tree was rooted using the outgroup taxon Spilonota lechriaspis (Lepidoptera). Numbers denote posterior probabilities of nodes. The lengths of very long branches have been reduced to aid viewing. The symbol ?//? indicates a contracted branch, with the value above giving the length of contraction. Red lines indicate the differences among the four phylogenetic trees."
