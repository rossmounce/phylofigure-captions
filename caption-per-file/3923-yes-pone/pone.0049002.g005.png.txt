Bayesian phylogenetic tree showing relationships among H9 influenza A viruses isolated in this study and publicly available sequences from GenBank.The clade including the Portuguese sequences, as well as some well-established H9N2 linages (Korea, G1 and Y280) are indicated. In addition, isolates associated with infections in humans and swine have been indicated by underlining and italics, respectively. The tree is rooted at the midpoint and numbers at nodes indicate posterior probability support. The scale bar indicates substitutions per site."
