"pone.0067085.g003.png","V3-loop haplotypes detected by quantitative deep sequencing are also found in CXCR4-using viruses growing in MT2 assays.Maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees showing that the V3-loop sequence of syncytium-inducing viruses grown in MT-2 assays (diamond) is identical to one of the predominant V3-loop haplotypes detected with quantitative deep sequencing in proviral DNA and/or plasma RNA before antiretroviral therapy initiation (Trees A to E) or after at least 2 years of persistent viremia suppression (trees F to H). Trees include V3-loop haplotypes present at a frequency ≥0.6% in the virus population in plasma (triangles), PBMCs before therapy initiation (circles) and PBMCs after persistent viremia suppression (squares); trees are rooted at the predominant plasma (trees A to E) or PBMC (trees G to H) V3-loop haplotype. Filled symbols represent CXCR4-using viruses; open symbols show R5 viruses. Symbol size increases proportionally to the V3-loop haplotype frequency in the virus population in 10% intervals. Node reliability was tested using 1,000 bootstraps; bootstrap values ≥50% are shown. CXCR4 use was defined by a Geno2Pheno [coreceptor] false positive rate ≤10%."
