Unrooted phylogenetic trees of unique sequences of HVR2s of Beijing HRSV-A (A) and HRSV-B (B) strains and reference sequences of identified genotypes.Trees were constructed using the neighbor-joining method with 1,000 bootstrap replicates by Mega5 software. Only bootstrap values of >70% are shown at the branch nodes. The tree is drawn to scale, with branch lengths in the same units as those of the evolutionary distances used to infer the phylogenetic tree. The evolutionary distances were computed using the p-distance method and are in the units of the number of base differences per site. Beijing strains are colored and indicated by “BJ/”, followed by their isolation numbers. Samples collected from different epidemic seasons are indicated by colored strain names and colored symbols as follows: 2007/2008, ▼; 2008/2009, ◆; 2009/2010, ●; 2010/2011, ■; 2011/2012, ▲. Strain names mentioned in the text are labeled with rectangles to facilitate visualization. New genotype clades are indicated by gray shading The numbers of identical sequences of HVR2 are indicated in parentheses. The genotype assignment is indicated at the right by square brackets. “BA?” refers to HRSV-B strains with a 60 nucleotide duplication that are not assigned to any cluster."
