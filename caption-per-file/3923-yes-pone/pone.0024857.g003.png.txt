Phylogenomic tree of Alphaproteobacteria and the Reclinomonas americana mitochondrion. A. ML and Bayesian tree of nine concatenated proteins whose phylogeny is closest to the Alphaproteobacteria phylogenomic tree. The Rhodobacterales are collapsed. B. Phylogenomic tree of 42 Alphaproteobacteria and the Reclinomonas americana mitochondrion without Odyssella thessalonicensis. The Rhizobiales and Rhodobacterales are collapsed. Both trees are rooted on Escherichia coli. Values near nodes are Bayesian posterior probabilities and ML bootstraps, respectively. Different orders of Alphaproteobacteria are labeled by different colors. Candidatus Pelagibacter ubique and Odyssella thessalonicensis are shown in red."
