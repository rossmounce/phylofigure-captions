"pone.0012637.g003.png","Genetic clustering and Bayesian inferred phylogeny of Leptospira isolates and strains based on MLST analysis.(See supplementary information, tables S1 and S2 for detailed information on all the isolates/strains analyzed.) Clades or embranchment corresponding to different species types have been marked in different colors. Major clades and minor clades have been identified by code names (A to K) which overlap with the designation of similar clades identified by FAFLP technique. Identities of individual isolates need not be comprehensible in the tree itself, but they can be read clearly in the supplementary Table S2. The analysis was performed using BEAST version 1.5.2, the tree was annotated using TreeAnnotator v1.5.2 and was visualized through FigTree v1.2.2."
