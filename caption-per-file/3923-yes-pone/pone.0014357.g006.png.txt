"pone.0014357.g006.png","Phylogenetic comparison of BQCV sequences detected in honey bee foragers, pollen pellets, and non-Apis hymenopteran pollinators.An unrooted maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree of BQCV (based on 687-nt from Capsid/3′UTR) was generated using a region of the structural proteins of the virus. The support for the indicated branching topology was evaluated by using bootstrap re-sampling of the sequences 1,000 times. Nodes supported by bootstrap values over 70 are given. Strains were annotated by genus, species, identification label, country of isolation and year of isolation. Blue =  virus from honey bee, red =  virus from pollen pellet, and green =  virus from non-Apis hymenopteran pollinators. Forager/pollen pellet pairs are indicated by common symbols following the sample label."
