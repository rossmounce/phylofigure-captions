"pone.0053299.g001.png","Phylogenetic analysis of the Calcium binding protein family in zebrafish.A) The phylogenetic tree of all human and zebrafish Calcium binding protein family members based on protein sequence. For all members there exist two paralogs in zebrafish per human paralog. Cabp7 and calneuron (cabp8) form a separate subfamily (brown shading). B) Domain structure of CaBP4b as predicted by ExPasy (www.expasy.org). C) Protein alignment of the two EF domains of the human CaBP4 protein, the known zebrafish ortholog (cabp4a) and its newly discovered paralog (cabp4b). The blue color represents the Blosum62 score; high similarities are in dark blue while lower similarities are indicated in light blue. The first EF-Hand domain shows a higher degree of conservation than the second one."
