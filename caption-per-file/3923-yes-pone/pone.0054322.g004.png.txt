"pone.0054322.g004.png","Phylogeographical tree of pol gene of CRF01_AE, CRF07_BC, B subtype.Ancestral geographic states were constructed using Bayesian phylogeographic inference framework implemented in the BEAST V1.6.2 package. The tree branches are colored according to their respective geographical regions. The time of most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) of clade was indicated in the node labels."
