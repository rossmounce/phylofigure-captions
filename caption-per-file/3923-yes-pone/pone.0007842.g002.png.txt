Y chromosome phylogenetic tree.NRY tree haplogroups observed in Philadelphia and Senegal data with typed SNPs indicated on each branch. Associated with each branch is the number of samples observed for each haplogroup in the pool of African Americans (AA, n = 199), European Americans (EA, n = 190), and Senegalese (Af, n = 33). We have omitted from the NRY tree M148 SNP designating E1b1b1a3a (formerly E3b1a). One EA sample belonging to this haplogroup was added to E1b1b1 (#). One EA sample was 12f2a* (Hg J) but was grouped with J1 (*) because of space constraints. The raw data can be found in File S1."
