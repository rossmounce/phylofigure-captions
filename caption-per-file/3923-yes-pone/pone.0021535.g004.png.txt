"pone.0021535.g004.png","Phylogenetic analysis of the full env sequences. Complete env coding sequences were aligned with HXB2 as the outgroup using the MUSCLE software and phylogenetic trees were constructed using the PhyML software. Main resistance mutations and compensatory mutations are indicated for each clone. Non-infectious clones are marked with a *. Bootstrap values >60% are indicated."
