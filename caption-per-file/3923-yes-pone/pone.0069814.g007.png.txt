"pone.0069814.g007.png","Ancestral State Reconstructions (ASR) for the sub-clades of Saxifraga sect. Trachyphyllum.Only members of sect. Trachyphyllum Clade T2 are shown (not S. aspera or S. bryoides because they were not included in the morphological analyses given their divergent phylogenetic positions). Sub-clades used in the ASR analyses are numbered (from Fig. 5). The first three columns denote the focal clades depicted in the subsequent bar plots (note that the bottom row is for sub-clade 1?=?Trachyphyllum), geographic location (white?=?North America, gray?=?Beringia, black?=?Eurasia), and subsection classification (white?=?Criomorphicae, gray?=?Dentaphyllae, black?=?Xeromorphicae), respectively. These columns are followed by the morphological characters and traits inferred for each sub-clade through the ASR analyses in SIMMAP. Only significant ASR's are shown; the absence of a bar indicates no significant trait was inferred. White and gray shading denote traits within each character as labeled."
