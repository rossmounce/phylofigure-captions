"pone.0094384.g002.png","Phylogenetic delineation of species in the B. burgdorferi complex based on chromosomal sequences.(A) Neighbor-Net network based on chromosomal sequence data that illustrates phylogenetic relationships among sampled and reference strains of Borrelia. The network was constructed with SplitsTree 4 software using the Neighbor-Net method and based on a distance matrix calculated in Paup* 4.0 b10 using a GTR+I+G model. In grey, the percentage of the 1-kb-long contiguous windows obtained from different genetic groups of Borrelia that support their monophyly. Distributions of expected probabilities of monophyly for strains of (B) B. garinii and (C) B. burgdorferi s.s. in the absence of recombination, based on 300 simulations of 1,000,000 genome alignments delineated into 1,000 bp windows. Continuous distributions (in red and green) were obtained using Gaussian kernels."
