"pone.0012511.g001.png","Phylogenetic tree of the replication initiation protein.Phylogenetic tree based on the replication initiation protein RepA of plasmids of genus Listeria and related genera. In the case of pF2-515 and pN1-017 multiple proteins had to be merged due to premature stopcodons. Clustalw [35] was used to create the multiple sequence alignment which was visualized using Dendroscope [60]. The clustering of the replication initiation proteins shows a clear separation into two phylogenetic groups."
