Heatmap of 103 probesets differentially regulated in all tissues.Probesets (≤5% FDR; ≥1.5-fold-change compared to control; and ≥50% present call within at least one condition/time point, across all tissues) are displayed on the vertical axis and designated, when available, by the symbol of the gene to which each is annotated, including duplicates. Tissue and time points are denoted on the horizontal axis. Each probeset has been normalized to its mean value across all times and tissues within one row. Red signifies expression above and green below the mean value within an individual row. As shown, baseline expression of these differentially expressed transcripts tends to decrease from PMBC > Spleen > Lung > Liver > Kidney, Heart. In contrast, all of these genes are induced by staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB) challenge with most reaching their highest levels of expression at 24 h across all tissues. aThree unannotated probesets, identified only by Affymetrix® probeset IDs; bPredicted gene Gm9706 of unknown function; second probeset annotated to Gm9706 is also annotated to the gene symbol Isg15; while these probesets do not cluster together, peak expression for both were seen in PBMCs at 24 h, suggesting that they may interrogate the same gene, but with different efficiencies; cProbably detecting Gbp6 with which it clusters, but this probeset retains its annotation to both Gbp10 and Gbp6 as shown; dProbably detecting Ifi202b with which it clusters, but this probeset retains its annotation to both LOC100044068 and Ifi202b as shown; eProbably detecting Gbp1, but this probeset retains its annotation to both LOC100047734 and Gbp1 as shown."
