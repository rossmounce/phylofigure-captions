Neighbor-joining phylogenetic analysis of 68 worldwide H. pylori isolates using seven concatenated housekeeping gene sequences.The differentiated bacterial populations were recognized and called hpAfrica2, hpAfrica1, hspNEAfrica, hpEurope (hpEurope1 and hpEurope2), hpAsia2, hpEAsia, hpAmerind and hpMaori. The Iranian strains shared ancestral origins with the European counterparts. Each lineage is supported by a higher bootstrap value given at the corresponding branch. The strains were colour-coded according to the origins they were isolated."
