Phylogenetic affiliation of clones within ochrophytes.Maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree constructed with 142 partial and complete ochrophyte 18S rRNA sequences (962 informative positions). Bootstrap values >50% are displayed. Clades within the chrysophytes follow the notation of del Campo and Massana [38]. Sequences indicated by red bars originate from this study; the numbers refer to the found clones in t0 and tend samples, respectively. Sequences from cultured representatives are shown in italics. Environmental clones are highlighted, according to their origin, in blue for marine clones and green for freshwater clones. The scale bar indicates 0.1 substitutions per position."
