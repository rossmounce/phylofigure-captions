The PIZ gene structure and phylogenetic analysis.(A) The phylogenetic tree based on CLUSTALW alignment of protein sequences. *At5g41040, putative feruloyl-CoA transferase [Arabidopsis thaliana] with highest sequence similarity to PIZ. **CrDAT, deacetylvindoline 4-O-acetyltransferase [Catharanthus roseus]. ***DcHCBT1, anthranilate N-hydroxycinnamoyl/benzoyltransferase [Dianthus caryophyllus]. ****BT2 AAX83048, taxadienol acetyl transferase [Ozonium sp. BT2]. *****StFHT, BAHD feruloyl transferase [Solanum tuberosum]. (B) Amino acid sequence alignment of PIZ and its close relatives. Amino acid sequences are aligned using ClustalW. Underlined HxxxDG indicates an acyl transferase active site and dotted line marks the consensus DFGWGKP sequence conserved among these transferases."
