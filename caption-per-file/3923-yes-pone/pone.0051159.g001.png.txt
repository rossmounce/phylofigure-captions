"pone.0051159.g001.png","Phylogeny of bacteria and eukaryotic PEPcase and inter-kingdom HGT candidates.Phylogeny of inter-kingdom HGT candidates and PEPcase sequences from representative taxa in bacteria and eukaryotes were reconstructed. Nine archaea sequences were included as outgroups. HGT candidates confirmed in this phylogeny are in bold letters with red branches. The branches of outgrouparcheae are in grey and all eukaryotic branches are in blue. The bootstrap values of 100 replicates in the three different methods were labeled on each branch in order of maximum likelihood, neighbor joining and maximum parsimony. Ancient HGT events are marked with a triangle on the branch."
