RAxML rapid bootstrap, PhyML aLRT and MrBayes posterior probability branch supports are shown at branches (>50/>0.8/>0.9 are shown as significant; dashes indicate insignificant support). Black dots indicate complete support (100/1/1). Numbers of sequences in collapsed clades are shown in brackets."
