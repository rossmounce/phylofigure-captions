"pone.0063396.g002.png","Summary of Bayesian fin whale phylogenetic tree using full mitogenome sequences (mito dataset).The root leads to divergence of fin whales from humpbacks. Branches with two or more samples in the same ocean basin have been collapsed. Numbers in parentheses are number of samples at each branch tip, except for the single Southern Hemisphere samples in clade 8 (SWFSC Lab ID 91296). Scale at bottom is node age in millions of years. Time to Most Recent Common Ancestor (TMRCA) estimates, 95% Highest Posterior Density (HPD), and posterior probabilities (PP) of each numbered node are given in the inset table. TMRCA values not reported for nodes with PP<0.9. The full annotated tree is available at the Dryad data repository, http://dx.doi.org/10.5061/dryad.084g8."
