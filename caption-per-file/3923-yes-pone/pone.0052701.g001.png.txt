"pone.0052701.g001.png","Phylogenetic analyses of vertebrate dopamine receptors in several species.The tree was routed with somatostatin receptors (drSSTT1: XP_696666.1; drdSTT2: XP_689033.4). A) The evolutionary history was inferred using the Neighbour-Joining method (NJ) [43]. The optimal tree with the sum of branch length?=?2.67314359 is shown. The percentage of replicate trees in which the associated taxa clustered together in the bootstrap test (1000 replicates) is shown next to the branches as percentage values. The tree is drawn to scale, with branch lengths in the same units as those of the evolutionary distances used to infer the phylogenetic tree. Evolutionary distances were computed using the p-distance method. B) The evolutionary history was inferred using the Maximum Likelihood (ML) method [44], which shows the most probable reconstruction and representative phylogeny of the groups. The percentage of replicate trees in which the associated taxa clustered together in the bootstrap test (1000 replicates) is shown next to the branches as percentage values. Gs and Gi represent the subunit of the G protein coupled that is related to dopamine receptors. Evolutionary analyses were conducted using MEGA5 [84].
