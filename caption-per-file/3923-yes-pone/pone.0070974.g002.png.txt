ML phylogenetic trees for Triatoma dimidiata species complex based on cyt b (left) and cyt b+ND4 (right) gene fragments.Bootstrap support values (above 50) are given above branches; Posterior probabilities for the Bayesian analysis are given below branches. Branch color codes indicate each of the four different genetic groups (plus T. hegneri) that comprise the T. dimidiata species complex. The three haplotypes in blue (Nic, Ec3, and Ec5) call attention to the high genetic similarity between specimens from Manabi, in Ecuador, and those from Nicaragua, indicating that T. dimidiata populations from the latter most likely represent the source of insects that were recently introduced into Ecuador."
