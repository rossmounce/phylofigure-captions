"pone.0034592.g002.png","The phylogenetic relationship, nest size, and distance from forest edge are shown for the five focal species.The bold lines in the phylogeny diagram (a) represent highly social spider species (phylogeny redrawn from [33]). The five species that we observed in Serra do Japi, which were used in our analyses, are labeled in this figure. Other species are shown to demonstrate the phylogenetic distances between focal species. These species differ in the median nest size by an order of magnitude, with more social species building larger nests (b). The more social species tend to occur further from the forest edge than the subsocial and nearly solitary species (c) The boxplots show the median and the upper and lower quartiles. The whiskers encompass the 1.5x the interquartile range, and circles represent outliers. Letters show statistically significant differences between species (Dunnett-Tukey-Kramer test for b, posthoc test on Kruskal-Wallis for c)."
