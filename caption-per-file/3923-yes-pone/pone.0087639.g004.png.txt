Phylogenetic analysis of the insect Vg gene amino acid sequences.Phylogenetic analysis of Vg genes from Aphis medicaginis and other species. The phylogenetic tree was constructed based on the amino acid sequences of known insect Vg genes. Full-length amino acid sequences were aligned using the Mega 5.05. A bootstrap analysis was carried out, and the robustness of each cluster was verified with 1000 replicates. Values at the cluster branches indicate the results of the bootstrap analysis. Vg genes were from Acyrthosiphon pisum (XM_003246072), Megachile rotundata (XM_003700846), Apis mellifera (XM_395423), Nasonia vitripennis (XM_001599457), Drosophila virilis (XM_002053179), Drosophila mojavensis (XM_001999625), Anopheles gambiae (XM_321018), Drosophila grimshawi (XM_001994162), Drosophila erecta (XM_001980075), Megachile rotundata (XM_003704272) and Tenebrio molitor (AB037697). The Oscheius tipulae (OSU35449) and Haemaphysalis longicornis (AB359899) genes were used as the outgroups."
