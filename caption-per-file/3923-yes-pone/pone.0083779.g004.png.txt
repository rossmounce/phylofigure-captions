Relationship between the Burkholderia Type 6 secretion systems and arrangement of gene clusters.Clusters were identified with BLASTP against the B. pseudomallei T6SS-2, and a concatenated neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree was generated in MEGA 5.1 using highly divergent protein sequencesâ€“VgrG, Hcp, ClpV, IcmF, and the lysozyme-like protein VC_A0109. The gene arrangements of the cluster were manually verified. Although B. oklahomensis EO147 was found to have five T6SS clusters (Fig. 1), it was excluded from the analysis because the draft quality of the genome sequence did not allow for full reconstruction of the gene arrangement of the operon. The four symbiotic strains emphasized in this study are highlighted in bold. The R. leguminosarum imp region clusters with the T6SS-4 group and is indicated with an asterisk. The T6SSa and TG6SSb clusters are found only in the environmental and symbiotic Burkholderia species."
