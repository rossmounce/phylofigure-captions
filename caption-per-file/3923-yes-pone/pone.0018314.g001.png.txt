Phylogenetic trees showing the wildtype genetic relationship of wildtype and consensus HA genes. Selected full-length H1 HA sequences were downloaded from NCBI and aligned using Clustal W. The 566 amino acid consensus sequences was determined from this alignment. The HA 1â€“5 con gene is shown localized to the central region of the multi-subtype phylogenetic tree (A). The HA1-con gene is shown in the phylogenetic H1 subtype tree (B). Unrooted phylogenetic trees were created using PHYLIP version 3.5c. The boxes represent consensus genes used to create the adenovirus vaccines. Diamonds represent wildtype gene used to create adenovirus vaccines. The circles represent viruses or peptides used to evaluate in vitro immune correlates induced by the vaccines. Dashed lines represent viruses used in lethal challenges."
