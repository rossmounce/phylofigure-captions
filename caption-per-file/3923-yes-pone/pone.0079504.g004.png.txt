Nuclear genes trees of Euparkerella.Bayesian phylogenetic inferences of nuclear haplotypes of four gene fragments (Î²-fibint7, C-myc, RAG-1 and TYR) of Euparkerella. Colors refer to populations and combinations of numbers-letters indicate localities (Figure 2 and Table S1 in File S1) corresponding to haplotypes. Posterior probabilities are indicated left to nodes. Asterisks represents posteriors equal or higher than 0.95."
