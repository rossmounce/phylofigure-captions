The most likely phylogram obtained in a maximum likelihood analysis of the combined dataset.Bootstrap values ≥ 95% (** = 100%, * = 95-99%) were plotted above branches and posterior support values ≥ 0.95 (**=1.00, *=0.95-0.99) below branches. Shown branch lengths correspond to the estimated substitution events (see bar). Vertical bars on the right side of the figure mark specimens that were recovered as part of a single network in statistical parsimony analyses of the combined dataset. The numbers correspond to the number of haplotypes per network. Letters on the right side correspond to molecular operational taxonomical units (MOTUs) discussed in the text. The amplification numbers and region are given for each specimen."
