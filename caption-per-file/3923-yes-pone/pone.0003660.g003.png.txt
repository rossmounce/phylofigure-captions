Positive selection on rrgB.Probability P(dN/dS>1) that a codon is under positive selection in rrgB. The branch-site model was tested separately for the three clades, marked on the phylogenetic tree on the right. From top to bottom: clade I, clade II clade III. The background color of the strain names identifies their MLST classification into clonal complexes. The likelihood ratio test supports the positive selection model only for clades I and II. Sites marked by dark circles are under positive selection with probability exceeding 99%."
