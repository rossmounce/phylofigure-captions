"pone.0044612.g003.png","The FS-H/FS-I/7-Cys family of flea salivary peptides.(A) ClustalW alignment indicating the cysteine residues in black background, the identical Tyr in yellow background, and the conserved amino acids in blue background. The numbers above the sequence indicate the six conserved cysteines. The signal peptide region is not shown. (B) Bootstrapped phylogram of the sequences based on the alignment in (A) after 1,000 iterations. The numbers at the nodes indicate the percent bootstrap support, and the bar at the bottom the amino acid divergence per site. Sequences identified in this work are named Cf- followed by the number of the originating contig from File S1. Sequences derived from GenBank are recognized by the first three letters of their genus name, followed by the first three letters of the species name, followed by the gi| accession number. The cat flea proteins giving the name of the family are indicated by FS-H and FS-I following their accession numbers."
