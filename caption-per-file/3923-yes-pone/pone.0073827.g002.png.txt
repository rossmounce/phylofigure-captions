Maximum likelihood analysis of representative sequences from operational taxonomic unit analysis (OTU) of bacterial 16S rRNA amplicons.Representative sequences from each bacterial OTU were aligned with MEGA 4.0 and phylogenetic analysis using was performed using GARLI 2.0 (500 bootstrap pseudoreplicates and TIM1+I+G evolutionary model). Nodes were collapsed and labeled by taxonomic class. Number of OTUs and percentage of amplicons assigned to each class are labeled. OTUs that could not be assigned to class level by RDP were omitted from the analysis."
