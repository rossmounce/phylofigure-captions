"pone.0093292.g001.png","Simplified phylogeny in related to the Reconstructed Sapiens Reference Sequence (RSRS [52]) and typing scheme of the 26 SNPs targeted in the AmericaPlex26.Sub-haplogroups, which can be unambiguously assigned, are shown in blue (blue). Basal hgs, which cannot be unambiguously assigned, are also shown (black) in order to illustrate the phylogenetic relationship, but also the inherent limitations of our assay. The phylogenetic position of the revised Cambridge Reference Sequence (rCRS [53]) is indicated within macro-hg N. SNPs with a SBE primer in reverse direction targeting the opposite strand are given in Italics."
