Phylogenetic position of the genome-sequenced Polynucleobacter strain. Reconstruction of the phylogenetic position of the genome-sequenced strain P.n. ssp. asymbioticus QLW-P1DMWA-1 and genome characteristics of the strains used for the phylogenetic analysis. The presented tree is based on concatenated alignments of amino acid sequences of proteins encoded by eight housekeeping genes and was constructed using the NJ method. Letters A to H refer to bootstrap values obtained for the respective nodes by three different treeing methods in analyses of nucleotide and amino acid sequence data sets. The bootstrap values are presented in Table S7."
