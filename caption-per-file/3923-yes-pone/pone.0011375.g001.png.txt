"pone.0011375.g001.png","The location of Bermuda, phylogeny of Plestodon, and molecular estimates of divergence times.a., Map showing the location of Bermuda relative to North America. b., Phylogeny of the genus Plestiodon (outgroups not shown; see Brandley et al, 2010). Branch lengths are in units of time and represent the means of the posterior distribution. Numbers above or below the nodes indicate posterior probabilities. Triangles indicate groups for which multiple species were sampled, but are not shown. Taxa in blue are those that inhabit eastern North America. Green bars indicate the 95% credible interval for estimated divergence dates for that node. c., Posterior probability distribution of the age of the divergence between Plestiodon longirostris and its sister lineage. Areas shaded in red are values that exceed the 95% credible interval."
