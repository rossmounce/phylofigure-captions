"pone.0062799.g005.png","Phylogeny of microbial collagenases.Collagenase consensus sequences are coloured in red (Contigs 108, 111â€“113). The actinobacterial clade is highlighted in yellow and subfamilies M09A and B are indicated. The Streptomyces reference sequences from the MEROPS M09 family are shown in green and the family holotypes in blue. MEROPS references displayed with species names and (arbitrary) collagenase copy number. The phylogeny was inferred using the maximum likelihood method. Numbers refer to bootstrap support values higher than 75%."
