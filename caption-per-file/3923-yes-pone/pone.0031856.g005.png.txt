"pone.0031856.g005.png","Bayesian phylogenetic tree of fungal Sgbs. Bayesian tree based on a MAFFT v.6.850 alignment of 59 fungal, one rotifer and one heterolobosan Sgbs, using two bacterial Pgbs as outgroup. Support values at branches represent Bayesian posterior probabilities (>0.5). The sequences are identified by the first three letters of the binary species name, and the full phylum and family names (see Table S1)."
