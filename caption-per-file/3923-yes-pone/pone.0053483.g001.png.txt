"pone.0053483.g001.png","Phylogenetic network analysis of Toxoplasma gondii isolates from humans and animals in China.From the 23 samples, 5 genotypes were identified. Genotype number (ToxoDB PCR-RFLP #) and the representative strains are listed for each taxonomic branch. The representative strains from each genotype were underlined found in this study. The numbers in parentheses indicate the number of isolates from this study belonging to that genotype. The phylogenetic network analysis with EF1, HP2, UPRT1, UPRT7, GRA6 and GRA7 shows a perfect match with PCR-RFLP allele types at 10 multilocus markers used in the present study."
