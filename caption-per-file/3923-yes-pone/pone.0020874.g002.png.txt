Phylogenetic analysis of virus genomes from LAPC4, VCaP and EKVX cell lines. The phylogenetic tree represents known xenotropic MLV sequences. This tree represents only xenotropic MLVs for which the full proviral sequence is known, which is likely only a small portion of all endogenous xenotropic MLVs present in mice."
