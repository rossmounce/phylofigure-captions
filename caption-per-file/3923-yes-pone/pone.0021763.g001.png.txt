"pone.0021763.g001.png","Distance-based neighbour-joining tree. Neighbour-joining phylogenetic reconstruction of nine wasp species using 941 bp sequence generated by concatenating the two gene fragments: 28S nrDNA (484 bp) and COI mtDNA (457 bp). Social complexity and nest type are indicated after the species names; social (Sol), communal aggregator (Com), solitary (Soc), paper nest (P), mud nest (M) and burrower (B). Bootstrap values were obtained using 10000 replicates."
