Phylogenetic tree of the RecA superfamily. All RecA sequences were grouped into clusters using the Lek algorithm. Representatives of each cluster that contained >2 members were then selected and aligned using MUSCLE. A phylogenetic tree was built by from this alignment using PHYML; bootstrap values are based on 100 replicas. The Lek cluster ID precedes each sequence accession ID. Proposed subfamilies in the RecA superfamily are shaded and given a name on the right. Five of the proposed subfamilies contained only GOS sequences at the time of our initial analysis (RecA-like SAR, Phage SAR1, Phage SAR2, Unknown 1 and Unknown 2) and are highlighted by colored shading. As noted on the tree and in the text, sequences from two Archaea that were released after our initial analysis group in the Unknown 2 subfamily."
