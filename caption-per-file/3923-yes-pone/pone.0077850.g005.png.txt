Dendrograms showing phylogenetic relationships between sequenced E30 isolated during the Cuban epidemic of aseptic meningitis in 2001 and the E30 isolate of the GenBank sequence database.The percentage of replicate trees in which the associated taxa clustered together in the bootstrap test (1000 replicates) is shown next to the branches. Strains of E30 known to be highly destructive of primary human insulin producing beta cells are shown in the tree by small black triangles."
