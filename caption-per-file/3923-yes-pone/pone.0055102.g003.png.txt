"pone.0055102.g003.png","RT domain-based phylogeny of group II intron ORFs.To the MSA alignment used for Fig. 2B, representatives of classes B: En.fmI3, B.a.I2, En.fm.I1, E.f.I3, B.me.I1, C.d.I1, G.k.I1, and B.c.I5; CL1A: A.v.I1, P.p.I2, E.c.I5, Th.e.I1, B.t.I1, Sh.sp.I1, Ms.b.I1; CL1B: B.me.I2, and B.a.I1; CL2A: Tr.e.I2, G.v.I1, Ns.p.I4, Cs.p.I1, and C.w.I1; CL2B: C.w.I6, Ns.p.I2, and Ns.p.I1; and ML: Ba.fr.I1, B.t.I2, N.a.I2, and L.l.I1 used by Simon et al. [15] were added (RT 0?7). The corresponding accession numbers can be obtained from the bacterial group II intron database. A consensus unrooted tree is shown and major ORF classes and the new groups are labeled. Bootstrap results (?75%) are given for each node (PhyML). The arrow indicates the common node of the lineage of group II introns with an En domain in their IEPs. The circle indicates the possible node grouping together class F introns."
