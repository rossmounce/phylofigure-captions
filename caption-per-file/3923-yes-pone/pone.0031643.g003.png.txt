Phylogenetic relationships among flp proteins. Relationships are shown as an unrooted maximum likelihood phylogram. The numbers at the nodes indicate maximum likelihood bootstrap support values/maximum parsimony bootstrap support values/Bayesian posterior probabilities. A dash indicates a value less than 60. Nodes without numbers have bootstrap support and Bayesian posterior probabilities of less than 60."
