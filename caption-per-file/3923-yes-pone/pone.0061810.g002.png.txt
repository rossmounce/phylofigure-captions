Sequence analysis of SsCBF1.(A) Amino acid sequence alignment between SsCBF1 and other known CBF1s. The alignment was performed using ClustalX 2.0 and DNAMAN software. Black background indicated conserved residues among all the proteins selected. The AP2 DNA-binding domain and other signature motifs were indicated by solid lines. (B) Phylogenetic relationships between SsCBF1 and other CBFs from various species. The phylogenetic tree was generated by the neighbor-joining method using MEGA 5.0. Organisms were abbreviated as follows: St, Solanum tuberosum; Sc, Solanum commersonii; Sl, Solanum lycopersicum; Ss, Solanum lycopersicoides; Ca, Capsicum annuum; At, Arabidopsis thaliana. GenBank accession numbers of the CBFs are listed as follows: AtCBF1 (AEE85066), AtCBF2 (AEE85064), AtCBF3 (AEE85065), AtCBF4 (ABV27186), SsCBF1 (ACY79412), SlCBF1 (AAS77820), SlCBF2 (AAS77821), SlCBF3 (AAS77819), ScCBF1 (ACB45093), ScCBF2 (ACB45094), ScCBF3 (ACB45092), ScCBF4 (ACB45084), StCBF1 (ABI74671), StCBF2 (ABI94367), StCBF3 (ACB45095), StCBF4 (ACB45083), StCBF5 (ACB45082), CaCBF1 (AAZ22480), CaCBF3 (ADM73296)."
