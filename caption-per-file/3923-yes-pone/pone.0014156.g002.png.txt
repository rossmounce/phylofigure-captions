Maximum Likelihood phylogenetic trees calculated using MrBayes [44]â€“[48] for COI and cyt b.Clades have been collapsed based on Order at nodes where all subsequent branches belong to a particular Order. Full versions of these trees can be found in the Figures S3 and S8. Details of the collapsed orders can be found in Text S2."
