"pone.0011546.g006.png","Phylogenetic analysis of putative catfish paralogues.Highly similar channel catfish sequences (Channel) and one blue catfish sequence (Blue) sharing the same BLAST identity, or two highly similar blue catfish sequences with one channel catfish sequence sharing the same BLAST identity, were subjected to phylogenetic analysis. The phylogenetic tree was drawn by using the neighbor-joining method in MEGA 4.0 package. The topological stability of the tree was evaluated by 1,000 bootstrap replications. Data were analyzed using Poisson correction and gaps were removed by complete deletion."
