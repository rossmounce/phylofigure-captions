"pone.0007614.g003.png","Phylogenetic analysis of protocadherin variable exon sequences.Protein sequences of the EC1-EC3 ectodomain region of anole, human and coelacanth protocadherin variable exons were aligned using ClustalW. The phylogenetic tree was generated by the Maximum likelihood method using PhyML. Protocadherin genes in the same paralog subgroups in different species are indicated by the same color. The robustness of the tree was determined using 100 bootstrap replicates. Bootstrap values for only the major branches are shown. The tree is unrooted."
