Neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree drawn using 1,103 bp COI sequences of 91 individuals of Panulirus penicillatus collected in the Eastern (EP), Central (CP) and Western Pacific (WP). Operational outgroup, Panulirus japonicus (NC_004251) [21] is not shown due to much longer branch than those within P. penicillatus. Bootstrap supports higher than 50% and numbers with branches indicate probability for 1,000 replications. Larval samples are shown in red. Samples carrying asterisk are from Central Pacific."
