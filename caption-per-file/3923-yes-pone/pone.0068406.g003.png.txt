"pone.0068406.g003.png","An ML phylogeny inferred from the nodA data for nodulating species and isolates of Burkholderia.Similar groupings were generated following BI analysis of the data. Statistical support of ? 60% for ML bootstrap (BS) and ? 0.60 BI posterior probability (PP) are indicated at the branches in the order PP/BS. Isolate/strain designations are followed by host name and geographic origin. The names of the indigenous legumes focused on in this study are abbreviated as in Table 1. Beta-rhizobial isolates from South Africa are indicated in green (and those from this study is in bold), while those from other regions appear in red. The scale bar indicates the number of nucleotide substitutions per site."
