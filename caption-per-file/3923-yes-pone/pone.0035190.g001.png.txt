Neighbor-joining (NJ) estimate of phylogenetic relationship for human enteroviruses detected among Thai pediatric children during 2006–2011.The NJ trees were constructed from nucleotide alignments of (A) the 5′UTR/VP2 (612 nt) and (B) partial VP1 region (257 nt) using MEGA software. The genetic distances were calculated according to the Kimura-parameter model. Bootstrap support values with 1000 pseudo-replicates were plotted at the internal branch nodes. EV species A to D were labeled. Period of the sample collection was plotted for each lineage. EV68 and other EVs identified in this study (TH-strain) are indicated in black and white circles, respectively. Virus sequence names or location of isolations shown with GenBank accession numbers were reference strains. Scale bar indicates number of nucleotide substitutions per site."
