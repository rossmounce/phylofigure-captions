"pone.0047861.g002.png","Sequence analysis of BmTGIF.(A) Sequence comparison showed that the homeodomain and adjacent carboxy-terminal region are conserved among the tested species. Vertical line indicates the carboxy-terminal limit of the homeodomain; the TALE amino acids, RYN, which are characteristic of the TGIF families are indicated by a black box; the DNA-binding-determining residue between F and N in WFIN are indicated by a red box. (B) The full amino acid sequences of TGIF were used to construct the phylogenetic tree using a NJ program with bootstrapping using 500 replicates. The bootstrap values are shown on each internal node.
