"pone.0085140.g002.png","Cyanobacterial 16S rRNA phylogeny and hydrocarbon pathway distribution.The 16S rRNA phylogeny of publicly available genome sequenced cyanobacteria (128) and additional strains investigated in this study (14) including G. violaceus PCC 7421 as the outgroup. Blue strain names indicate strains possessing the FAAR/ADO pathway and red indicates those with the OLS pathway. Purple strain names indicate a strain that does not have a genome sequence and therefore pathway presence cannot yet be verified. Cyanobacterial subdivisions are labeled using colored branches following the key in the upper left: (1) Subdivision 1. Uniceullular (Formerly Chroococcales), Subdivision II. Baeocystous (Formerly Pleurocapsales), Subdivision III. Filamentous (Formerly Oscillatoriales), Subdivision IV. Heterocystous (Formerly Nostocales), Subdivision V. Ramified or True Branching (Formerly Stigonematales). The clade indicated as ?A? represents the main clade of cyanobacteria with the OLS pathway while clade ?B? indicates the Moorea strains and clade ?C? indicates the clade containing Leptolyngbya sp. PCC 6404. Baysian posterior probabilities are displayed at nodes (o?=?posterior support<0.5)."
