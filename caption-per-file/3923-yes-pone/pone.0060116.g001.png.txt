"pone.0060116.g001.png","Distribution of all identified htp genes among 38 streptococci in a clear phylogenetic background.A. Phylogenetic analysis of 38 streptococci based on 530 single-copy orthologous proteins. Node labels indicate aLRT SH-like branch support values. Twenty-six species have been used in the previous phylogeny analysis based on 16s rDNA, while 14 species or subspecies were newly added and labeled in bold. Group division was updated based on the phylogenetic relationship. B. Copy numbers of htp genes within each genome are indicated with complete genes plus pseudogenes."
