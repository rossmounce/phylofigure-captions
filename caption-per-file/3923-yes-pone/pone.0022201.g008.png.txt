An example phylogenetic tree . This tree shows the sequence data for five sequences at a single site . The amino acid codes at the tips of the branches (, , , , and ) show the residue identities for the five sequences at this site. The variables at the internal nodes (, , , ) are the amino acid identities at the site for the ancestral sequences, and must be inferred. The numbers next to the nodes are unique identifiers for the nodes. The branch lengths (, ,â€¦) are proportional to the time since the divergence of the sequences."
