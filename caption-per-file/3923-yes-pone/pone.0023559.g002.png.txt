"pone.0023559.g002.png","Best maximum likelihood phylogeny for the Rapunculus clade of the Campanuleae based on concatenated atpB, matK, rbcL, and trnL-F DNA sequences. Outgroups have been removed for clarity. Pie graphs on branches indicate relationships that are well-supported under one or more of the three tree-building methods that we employed. Black-filled segments of the graphs indicate maximum parsimony (upper left) or maximum likelihood (upper right) bootstrap values ≥75, or Bayesian posterior probabilities ≥0.95 (bottom). Gray shading denotes North American species. Subclades Rapunculus 1A, 1B, 2A, 2B, and 2C are discussed in the text."
