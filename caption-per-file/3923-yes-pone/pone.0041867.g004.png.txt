Phylogenetic relationship of barley TCS elements and counterparts of Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza sativa.Phylogenetic trees are based on inferred amino acid sequences from complemented barley 454 contigs (see information in Table 2) and full-length amino acid sequences adopted from different databases (TAIR release 9, Rice Genome Annotation project and NCBI Protein database). Multiple alignments were performed using ClustalW algorithm with BLOSUM protein weight matrix (DNAstar software). Barley sequences are highlighted by blue boxes. Elements from other species are identified by chromosome loci or GenBank accession number. (A) Histidine kinases, colours indicate different subgroups. Arabidopsis PDK was used as outgroup. (B) HPt elements, protein sequences of Zea mays and Triticum aestivum were additionally included in the alignment. Yeast HPt protein YPD1 was used as outgroup. (Câ€“E) Type-A, -B, -C response regulators, amino acid sequences of selected maize response regulators were included in the alignment. For reasons of simplicity not all Arabidopsis and rice elements were included in the phylogenetic trees."
