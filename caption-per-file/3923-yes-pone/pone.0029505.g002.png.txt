"pone.0029505.g002.png","Inferred phylogenetic relationships of SFV pol sequences detected in bushmeat samples. Neighbor-joining (NJ) and maximum-likelihood (ML) analysis gave identical branching orders. New SFV sequences identified in this study are boxed. Clades of sequences from Mandrillus, Cercopithicus, Chlorocebus, Macaca, Pongo, Gorilla, and Pan paniscus are collapsed for presentation. Branch lengths are drawn to scale and only bootstrap values (NJ/ML) greater than 70% are shown."
