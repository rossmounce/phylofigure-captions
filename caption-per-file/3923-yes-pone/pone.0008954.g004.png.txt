Phylogenetic position of Helicosporidium sp. ATCC 50920 as inferred from amino acid sequences derived from the seven protein-encoding genes that are shared between all sequenced chlorophyte mtDNAs.The best ML-tree inferred with PHYML 3.0 under the LG+Î“4+F+I model of amino acid substitutions is shown here (13 taxa, 2362 positions, 1373 phylogenetically informative). The charophyte green algae Mesostigma viride and Chaetosphaeridium globosum were used as outgroups. Bootstrap values over 80% are shown above the corresponding nodes. Branch lenghts are drawn to scale. Pedinomonas minor has not yet been assigned unambiguously to one the four classes of chlorophyte green algae."
