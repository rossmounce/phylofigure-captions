"pone.0037463.g005.png","Phylogenetic tree of the R2R3-MYB proteins from maize (Zm), Arabidopsis (At), and other plant species.The neighbor-joining tree includes 158 R2R3-MYB proteins from maize, 126 R2R3-MYB proteins from Arabidopsis, and a further 52 R2R3-MYB proteins from other plant species. The proteins are clustered into 37 subgroups (triangles), designated with a subgroup number (e.g., G1). Subfamilies are represented as collapsed triangles, with depth and width proportional to sequence divergence and size, respectively. The black triangles indicate that the subgroup includes ZmMYBs and AtMYBs; the hatched and white triangles indicate that the subgroup includes or excludes ZmMYBs, respectively. Bootstrap values "
