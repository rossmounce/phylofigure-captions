Phylogenetic analysis comparison of MLST and WGST data from 22 C. gattii isolates. Maximum parsimony phylogenetic analysis was performed in MEGA4 on 22 C. gattii genomes with MLST (panel A, one of 270 most parsimonious trees shown) and WGST (panel B, one of 190 most parsimonious trees shown) data. The R265 whole genome sequence was used as the reference for SNP discovery. Both trees are rooted on the VGI/VGIII branch. Bootstrap values less than 50% and for intra-VGIIa, VGIIb and VGIIc branches are not shown. The taxa nomenclature includes a four digit unique identifier, the location of origin (BC = British Columbia, CA = California, ID = Idaho, OR = Oregon and WA = Washington state), and the molecular subtype as determined by MLST analysis (I, IIa, IIb, IIc and III). The number of SNPs included in each data set is indicated (number of parsimony-informative SNPs in parentheses), as is the consistency index (CI) as calculated by MEGA4. While WGST analysis found unique genotypes for all isolates, they are not visible on this tree due to the large numbers of SNPs separating the VGII from VGI and VGIII isolates."
