"pone.0065337.g003.png","The phylogenetic tree and the bootscanning plots of near-full-length sequences of HIV-1 strains isolated from Dehong and Myanmar.(A) The phylogenetic tree of near-full-length sequences from IDUs in Dehong (red circles) and Myanmar (black circles).(B)The bootscanning plots of near-full-length sequences from the cluster that included sequences from IDUs both in Dehong and in Myanmar with bootstrap values above 70. In the recombination analyses, a subtype C strain from India (95IN21068) (pink) and a subtype B? strain from Yunnan (RL42) (blue) were used as subtype references, and a CRF01_AE strain from Thailand (CM240) (green) was used as an out-group control."
