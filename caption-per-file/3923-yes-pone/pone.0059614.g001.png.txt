"pone.0059614.g001.png","Phylogenetic analysis of 25 concatenated collagen α1 (I) and α2 (I) sequences taken from the Ensembl Genome Browser.Maximum Likelihood analyses produce a phylogenetic signal in good agreement with previously published genomic data (e.g. [13]–[14]). Branch lengths are reported as the mean number of changes per site, bootstrap support is labelled and chicken (Gallus gallus) used as the outgroup."
