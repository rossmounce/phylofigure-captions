Neighbor Joining phylograms depicting wild and domesticated pigeonpea.Panel A, relationships among wild Cajanus species. Species groups are designated by color: orange, Wild-Scarabaeoides; green, Wild-Australia; black, Wild-India. Panel B, expansion of domesticated lineages from Panel A. The nature of accessions is reflected in their colors: red, wild progenitor; blue, cultivars and genebank accessions; pink, landraces. *** indicates mislabeled accessions annotated as wild species. The two Neighbor-Joining trees are linked to each other at Panel B and Panel A respectively. Bootstrap values of â‰¥50% are shown above their respective branches."
