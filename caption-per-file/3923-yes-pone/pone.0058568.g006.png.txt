"pone.0058568.g006.png","Base-composition distance diagrams of nt123_degen1 and nt123 data sets for the 63 taxa in the Tineoidea test set.Both diagrams are drawn to the same scale, and units are 'per cent ÷ 100'. Bootstrap percentages ≥50% are displayed. Bootstrap percentages are based on analysis of total taxon-specific nucleotide compositions, as described in Materials and Methods. All terminal taxa are identified to genus for nt123 but not for nt123_degen1, due to the reduced compositional heterogeneity in the latter data set. The vertical bars identify those taxa used in a phylogenetic analysis (Figure 5) to test the effect of reduced compositional heterogeneity on the analysis of nt123. The five sets of taxa whose inter-relationships are analyzed in Figure 5 are color- and/or symbol-coded (see key)."
