"pone.0008518.g001.png","Phylogeny of VP4/2 gene sequences amplified from study subjects and comparison with corresponding full length sequences of HRV-C and other samples where 5′UTR groups had been previously assigned [19].Symbols identify HRV-Cc (ie. with species C-like 5′UTR sequences) or HRV-Ca (species A-like) as described in the key. The neighbour-joining tree was constructed using maximum composite likelihood distances estimated between sequences in the amplified region (positions 629–1063 numbered according to the HRV-B14 reference sequence (NC_001490). Data was bootstrap re-sampled 100 times to assess robustness of branches; values of 70% or greater shown. Sequences showing incompatibilities between 5′UTR and phylogenetic grouping in VP4/VP2 suggestive of recombination are arrowed."
