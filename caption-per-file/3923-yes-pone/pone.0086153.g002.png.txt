"pone.0086153.g002.png","Conserved Soybean Cotyledon miRNAs in Divergent Orders of Land Plants.The conservation of soybean cotyledon miRNA families across plant species belonging to 12 orders is presented. The presence of a miRNA family that is conserved with a soybean cotyledon miRNA in at least one plant species in a given order is shown by differently colored cells. Green cells indicate conservation in land plants, brown cells in seed plants, light blue cells in angiosperms, purple cells in core eudicots, tan cells in vitales, red cells in sapindales, blue cells in rosids and yellow cells in fabales. The evolutionary relationship among the 13 orders is illustrated by the phylogenetic tree placed on top of the miRNA table. The number of family members in the soybean genome and the expressed family members in cotyledons, the count of miRNA reads in cotyledons, and the processing precision are shown for each conserved miRNA family."
