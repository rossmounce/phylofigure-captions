Distribution of the predictions across the taxonomy.The center of the tree corresponds to the class level (Î³-Proteobacteria), and the outer levels are in succession: order, family, genus, species. The bacterial lineages were downloaded from NCBI Taxonomy (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/) and the names of the most important clades are reported in green on the figure. The outermost circle displays the single strains in the dataset, labeled with their PID identifier, and colored according to the prediction: Yellow - True Positives, Gray - True Negatives, Red - False Positives, Blue - False Negatives. The figure was produced with the phylogenetic tree viewer Dendroscope [46] with manual annotation of the clade names."
