Overview of the sampling strategy.The circular cladogram represents the Maximum Parsimony strict consensus tree inferred from the mass sampling (MS, D680). Dotted lines (red) indicate accessions sampled for the classification-guided sampling (CS, D088). Asterisks refer to accessions sampled for the phylogeny-guided sampling (PS, D101). Blue dots indicate crown groups for the respective ""Cam"" clades containing at least one accession of Campanula (Cam01 to Cam17; see text). LOBE = Lobelioideae; CYPHI: Cyphioideae; CA-CYA: Campanuloideae-Cyanantheae; CA-WAH: Campanuloideae-Wahlenbergieae."
