Complete mtDNA phylogenetic tree of haplogroup H6.The schematic tree is based on phylogenetic tree presented on Figure S2. Time estimates (in kya) shown for mtDNA subclades are based on the complete genome substitutions [42]. The circle size is proportional to the number of individuals sharing the haplotype. Geographical origin is indicated by different colours: green - central and eastern Europe (Czech Republic, Poland, Russia, Slovakia, Ukraine); yellow ? southern Europe (Italy, Spain); red ? western Europe (Austria, Germany, Netherlands); blue ? northern Europe (Denmark, Finland, Ireland, United Kingdom, Orkney Islands); black ? Near East (Israel, Jordan); grey ? America (Philadelphia); white - unknown origin."
