Hypotheses of “semionotiform” phylogenetic relationships of Cavin [12].A, Strict consensus tree of 71 most parsimonious trees after the first cladistic analysis based on 31 taxa and 42 informative characters. B, strict consensus tree of 26 most parsimonious trees after the third analysis based on 25 taxa (excluding taxa with 35% or more missing data) and 45 informative characters (three multistate characters were split)."
