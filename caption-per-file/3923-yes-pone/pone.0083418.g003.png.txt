Streptococcus phylogenetic tree.Unrooted maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree based on multiple protein sequence alignments (length 5605 residues) of the 450 orthologous groups with exactly one member in 64 Streptococcus genomes. Genomes belonging to the Pyogenic group are highlighted in red, S. bovis species-group in green, S. mutans species-group in blue, S. salivarius species-group in purple, and S. mitis species-group in orange. Small-intestinal Streptococcus strains are highlighted and bulleted. Visualisation of the nodes (i.e. multiple leaves) of the S. pyogenes, S. equi, S. agalactiae, S. mutans, S. pneumoniae, and S. suis genomes were collapsed into triangles. Values in the tree are approximate likelihood ratio test (aLRT scores (SH-like) as calculated by PhyML)."
