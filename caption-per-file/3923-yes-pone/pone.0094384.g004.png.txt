Phylogenies and population structures of B. burgdorferi s.s. and B. garinii.Neighbor-Net networks based on chromosomal data reveal the phylogenetic relationships among sampled and reference strains of (A) B. burgdorferi s.s. and (C) B. garinii. Networks were constructed with SplitsTree 4 software and were based on a distance matrix calculated in Paup* 4.0 b10 using a GTR+I+G model. Strain names are surrounded in function of the main population they were assigned to using Structure; the results of the best run of Structure v2.3.4 are shown for (B) B. burgdorferi s.s. (K = 7) and (D) B. garinii (K = 13). Analyses were based on all polymorphic sites present in at least 90% of strains identified using multiple alignments of chromosomal data, assuming correlations among linked loci and allowing admixture among potential populations."
