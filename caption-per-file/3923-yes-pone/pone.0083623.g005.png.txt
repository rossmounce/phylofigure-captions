"pone.0083623.g005.png","Bayesian phylogenetic analysis and divergence time estimation in BEAST 1.7.1 [45] using the complete mitochondrial DNA cytochrome b gene.We used four independent fossil calibration points (indicated as orange bars). Numbers at nodes represent estimates of divergence times with highest posterior probability, while bars around each divergence time estimate represent 95% highest posterior density of the estimate."
