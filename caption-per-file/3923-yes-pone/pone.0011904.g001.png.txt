Phylogenetic tree and motif distributions of the Tetherin protein sequences from mammals.The phylogenetic tree (left panel) was constructed based on a complete alignment of 33 Tetherin protein-coding sequences using the maximum likelihood methods with 1000 bootstrap replications. Bootstrap percentages are shown at interior nodes. The primate species are shown in purple. The ruminant species are shown in red. The location of identified motifs in Tetherin is shown in the right panel. The domain maps (CD, Cytoplasmic domain; TMD, Transmembrane domain) of the Tetherin protein are predicted using SMART."
