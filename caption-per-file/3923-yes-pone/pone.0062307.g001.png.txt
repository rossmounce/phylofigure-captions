Unconstrained Bayesian phylogenetic tree and species topology.(A) Unconstrained Bayesian phylogenetic tree based on Myo6 gene coding sequences, under the model of TIM3+I+?. Values on the nodes are posterior probabilities. (B) The species tree of 24 mammals based on accepted bat species relationships (see Materials and Methods). Seven branches tested both by the two-ratio model tests and the branch-site model A tests were marked by A, B, C, D, E, F and G, respectively."
