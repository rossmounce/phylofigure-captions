SCaMC-1Like, SCaMC-1L, a new SCaMC paralog emergedby a tandem duplication in mammals.(A) Scheme of the head-to-tail tandem array of mouse SCaMC-1(slc25a24) and 4930443G12Rik/SCaMC-1L genes. SCaMC-1, SCaMC-1Land flanking loci are represented by arrows indicating transcription orientation. SCaMC-1/SCaMC-1Lintron-exon organization is also shown. Exons are indicated by filled boxes(not to scale) and numbered. (B) Alignment of predicted mouseand rat SCaMC-1L protein sequences (Mm_SCaMC-1L and Rn_SCaMC-1L) with thatof mouse SCaMC-1 (slc25a24, Mm_SCaMC-1). Alignment was performed with ClustalWand colored with BOXSHADE 3.21 software. Predicted EF-hand calcium-bindingmotifs are indicated by red boxes. Secondary structure prediction for theregion homologous to mitochondrial carriers, amino acids 181 to end, of Mm_SCaMC-1Lwas obtained using Jpred3 server [69].The predicted transmembrane helices are indicated (H1–H6), matrix loopsare marked in lower case letter and the β-strand region by an arrow. Theresidues proposed as participants in substrate interactions in H2, H4 andH6 [34]are included in boxes and marked with asterisks. (C) Phylogeneticrelationships among SCaMC-1 and SCaMC-1L paralogs. The phylogenetic tree wasconstructed using amino acid sequences derived from exons 2 to 7 with theneighbor-joining method (MEGA 4.0, [70])and PAM distances. Non-mammalian vertebrate SCaMCs were used as outgroups.The scale of branch lengths is indicated (number of substitutions per site).Percentage bootstrap values are shown in each node (500 replicates, only bootstrapvalues of 60% or more are shown). The accession numbers of annotatedSCaMC-1 and SCaMC-1L proteins as well as the amino-acid sequences of manuallyassembled orthologs are compiled in Supplementary Tables S1 and S2. See alignment in Figure S6."
