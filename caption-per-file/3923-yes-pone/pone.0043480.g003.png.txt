Phylogenetic tree constructed using ARB software using neighbor-joining method.A total of 19 representative sequences were randomly selected and used as references for phylogenetic tree construction. The lengths of the branches indicate the relative divergence among the amino acid sequences. Sequences with the same source were clustered together and the numbers of sequences in each soil were listed. The numbers at the nodes indicate bootstrap values based on 1000 replications and bootstrap values (>50) are displayed. The scale bar represents 0.1 amino acid substitution per position."
