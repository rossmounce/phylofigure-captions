Characteristics of life cycles and phylogeny in chlorarachniophyte species. The tree was drew based on a phylogenetic tree of nucleomorph ITS sequences [13]. All information was obtained from [5]–[7], [9], [10], [12], [13], [16]–[19]. Each column shows present or absent of amoeboid, coccoid, and flagellate cells in life cycles. + indicates main stage; , present; −, absent; (+), very rare. Solid arrowheads indicate losses of amoeboid stage in life cycles. Open arrowheads indicate losses of coccoid stage."
