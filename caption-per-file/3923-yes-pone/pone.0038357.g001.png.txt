Bayesian 50% majority rule consensus trees based on different markers (mtMutS, cox1 and 18S) and marker combinations.For mtMutS, the effect of indels on phylogeny inference was tested by removing them with Gblocks. Chrysogorgiidae taxa are either color coded (MCC) or have bolded branches (nonMCC).The MCC clade is evidenced by a gray circle. All trees are rooted to the Pennatulacea, except trees using the entire mtMutS gene (rooted to the Ellisellidae). For sake of clarity, tip labels and node support values were removed, but can be consulted on Figure S1."
