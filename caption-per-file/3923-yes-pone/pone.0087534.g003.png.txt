"pone.0087534.g003.png","Bayesian phylogenetic trees of MHC class II ? exon 3.This tree was constructed using sequences of MHC class II ? among different species of Crocodylia, Aves and Mammalia using the amphibian sequence as an outgroup. Sequences generated in the current study are from two families of Crocodylia: Crocodilidae (pale green colour) and Alligatoridae (pale red colour). Brackets on the left show vertebrate groups to which the MHC class II ? sequences belong, and those on the right show Clades 1 and 2 of the MHC sequences and seven subclades (A?G) for Clade 1. The two clades were defined on the basis of their monophyletic groupings and high posterior probability (PP?=?1.0). TSP5?12 corresponding to particular MHC sequences, which are described above, follow immediately after the sequence name. Support on branches is indicated by bootstrap values (BV) for maximum likelihood (above) and posterior probabilities (PP) for Bayesian analysis (below), as both analyses provide significantly similar trees described in the text."
