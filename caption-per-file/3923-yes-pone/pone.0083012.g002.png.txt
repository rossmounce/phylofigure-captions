Radial phylogram constructed using SNPs and showing clustered samples.The best-scoring maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree was constructed using the set of 6,847 SNP sites. Support values computed from 100 bootstrap replicates provide assessment of confidence for each clade and are shown at the nodes of the tree. SNP variations within the clusters are summarised in Table 3."
