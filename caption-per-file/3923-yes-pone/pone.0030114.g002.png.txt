"pone.0030114.g002.png","Specific activities of heterologously expressed and purified FDR-A and -B enzymes against different substrates. M. smegmatis enzymes characterized previously (red) or herein (blue) and enzymes from the other Actinomycetales species characterized herein (pink) are color-coded and labeled as per Fig. 1 and their phylogenetic relationships are shown on the left (reformatted from Fig. 1). Subclades that have been condensed are labeled ◊. Specific activities are given as means and standard errors of at least three biological replicates. Substrates were tested with 1 µM enzyme except for MSMEG_5998 (0.1 µM) for AFG1 and AFB1 and MSMEG_2027 (0.5 µM) for imperatorin. ND – Not detected."
