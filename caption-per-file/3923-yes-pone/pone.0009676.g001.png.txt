Alignment of D. discoideum BTG with other members of the A-PRO family and their phylogenetic relationship.a, The A-PRO domains of representatives members of the family have been aligned to D. discoideum BTG. Identical residues are in dark grey whereas conserved aminoacids are in light grey. GR (A) and B boxes are indicated with a line above the alignment. b, Phylogenetic relationship among Dd-btg and other APRO members. The alignment in (a) was used to generate the dendrogam."
