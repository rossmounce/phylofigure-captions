Unexpected diversity has been found in the phylum Placozoa.Shown is the 16S Bayesian inference phylogram of different placozoan haplotypes. Presently seven genetically highly different clades (I–VII) have been identified. Haplotypes H18 and H19 have been newly identified in this study (red). Please note that the lineages H5 and H19 differ in just one nucleotide position within a highly variable loop region, which has been removed from the alignment (the result is the shown polytomy). Current knowledge on placozoan biodiversity is still limited and more samples are urgently needed. For details on phylogenetic analyses see Material and Methods and [49]. Numbers beside nodes are from left to right: Bayesian posterior probabilities, Maximum likelihood and Maximum Parsimony bootstrap support. Values below 70% are marked with ‘-’."
