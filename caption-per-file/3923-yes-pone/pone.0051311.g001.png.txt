Detailed maximum parsimony tree of 46 novel complete Native American mtDNA sequences belonging to the novel haplogroups B2i2 and C1b13.These are the first completely sequenced mitogenomes for both B2i2 and C1b13. This tree also includes two previously published sequences of Kayapó individuals from Brazil [19] classified as belonging to sub-clade B2i1. Mutations relative to the L3 node are shown on the branches; they are transitions unless a base is explicitly indicated. The prefix @ indicates reversions while suffixes indicate: transversions (to A, G, C, or T), indels (.1, d), gene locus (∼r, rRNA; ∼t, tRNA), synonymous or non-synonymous changes (s or ns), and non-coding sites outside the control region (nc). The mutations marked by a red @ are reverted only relative to the Revised Sapiens Reference Sequence (RSRS) [24], all other mutations are relative to both rCRS [75] and RSRS. Recurrent mutations within the phylogeny are underlined. The variation in number of cytosines around nps 309 and 16193 was not included in the tree. Additional information regarding each mtDNA is available in Table 1. Coalescence times shown for B2i2 and C1b13 are Maximum-Likelihood (ML) estimates, and have been obtained by including all sequence changes (except 16182C, 16183C, and at np 16519) from the respective root according to Soares et al. [78]."
