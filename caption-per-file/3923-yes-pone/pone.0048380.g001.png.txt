Reduced strict consensus of the parsimony combined phylogenetic analysis of morphological and molecular dataset using TNT.Small yellow circles show the multiple alternative positions in the most parsimonious trees of the late Miocene caviid Allocavia (pruned from the reduced consensus tree). Numbered nodes on the tree indicate the calibration constraints used in the molecular clock estimates (see Calibrated Nodes). The phylogenetic tree is calibrated against geological time based on the first occurrence of fossil taxa in the fossil record. The most relevant South American Land Mammal Ages are highlighted in color."
