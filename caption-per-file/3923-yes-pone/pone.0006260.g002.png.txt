hTectonin gene is widespread across many species.The phylogenetic tree of hTectonin homologues constructed by primary sequence similarity shows its prevalence and conservation among a vast number of different species, right down to the worm, C. elegans. The human hTectonin protein was used as a query sequence in BLAST. Top hits were then compiled and multiple sequence alignment based on a guide tree was done using CLUSTALW [32] and the alignment was edited with Jalview [33]. The tree was constructed using the neighbour joining algorithm of the PHYLIP package. The numbers at the nodes are an indication of the level of confidence for the branches as determined by bootstrap analysis (1000 bootstrap replicates)."
