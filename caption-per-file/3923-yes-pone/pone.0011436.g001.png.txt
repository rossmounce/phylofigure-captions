"pone.0011436.g001.png","Maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees. Trees of nef (A) and vif (B) sequences from six controller patients (black circles) along with references for all known subtypes from the LANL database (labeled branches) are displayed. HXB2_LAI_IIIB_BRU (K03455) HXB2 reference sequence is boxed. The construction of the trees is described in the text. For purposes of clarity, the trees were midpoint rooted. The aLRT values of ≥70% are indicated at nodes. The scale bars represent 0.05 nucleotide substitution per site. Clustering of the six controllers with subtype B is evident in nef and vif trees (aLRT ≥85%)."
