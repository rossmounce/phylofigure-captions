"pone.0031947.g004.png","Phylogenetic analysis of M. ap isolates form different hosts. A dendrogram displaying the relationship between several M. ap isolates based on the sequence of 3 genes (gyrA, gyrB and recF). Isolates with JQ designation were analyzed in this study either from camels (JQ5, JQ6) or sheep (JQS1, JQS2). M. ap S397 is the standard strain for M. ap-S [25], M. ap K10 is the standard strain for M. apâ€“C [23] while the rest of the isolates were genotyped before [18]. All of the known genotyped are included in the figure. The bootstrap values (1000 replicates) are shown next to the branches. The tree is drawn to scale, with branch lengths in the same units as those of the evolutionary distances used to infer the phylogenetic tree. The evolutionary distances were computed using the Maximum Composite Likelihood method and are in the units of the number of base substitutions per site. See Table 2 for the sequence accession numbers used here."
