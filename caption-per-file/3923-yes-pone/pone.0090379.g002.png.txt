Unrooted trees representing the phylogenetic relationships among Inner Mongolia CVB4 strains and other EV-B strains.The phylogenetic trees based on the nucleotide sequences for the P1 (a), P2 (b), and P3 coding sequences (c) were constructed from nucleotide sequence alignment using the neighbor-joining algorithm of MEGA 5.0 software. The numbers at the nodes indicate bootstrap support for that node (percent of 1000 bootstrap pseudoreplicates). The scale bars represent the genetic distance, and all unrooted trees have the same scale."
