"pone.0007666.g001.png","Poxvirus phylogenetic tree inferred from Bayesian analysis of the DNA sequences from 9 conserved genes.Four Metropolis-coupled Markov chain Monte Carlo simulations using the general time reversible (GTR) Î³ I model were run over 5 million generations, with trees and parameters being sampled every 100 generations. The consensus tree was derived from 30,000 of the trees sampled. All but 2 nodes had posterior probabilities of 1.00; these two nodes are labeled in the figure. A close-up of the Orthopoxvirus lineage is presented in the inset. GC-rich genomes are indicated by the yellow box."
