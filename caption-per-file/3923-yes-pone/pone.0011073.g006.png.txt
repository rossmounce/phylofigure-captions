"pone.0011073.g006.png","A phylogenetic perspective of Malagasy primate niche space as defined by rainfall variables (principal component 1).There is a no significant phylogenetic signal in this niche axis for all species comparisons (p = 0.116), or within the Lepilemuridae (p = 0.428), Cheirogaleidae (p = 0.265), or Lemuridae (p = 0.207) families. The Indriidae display the highest level of phylogenetic signal in the rainfall niche axis (p = 0.031). Also note that several distantly related species converge on a similar niche space."
