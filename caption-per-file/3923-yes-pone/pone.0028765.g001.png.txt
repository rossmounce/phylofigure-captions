"pone.0028765.g001.png","Resistance to Hpa compared with overall Arabidopsis phylogeny. The phylogenetic tree on the left represents a reconstruction of the overall genealogy of 72 Arabidopsis accessions derived from 205k genome-wide small nucleotide polymorphism data published previously [13]. Bootstrap values (>70) are displayed on the branches of the tree. The Hpa sporulation data obtained in this study is displayed on the right and color-coded according to the ability of the pathogen to produce sporangiophores: red – no sporulation, orange – sporulation only on cotyledons, but not on true leaves, yellow – sporulation on both cotyledons and true leaves."
