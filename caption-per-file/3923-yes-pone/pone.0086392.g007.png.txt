"pone.0086392.g007.png","Maximum likelihood trees showing phylogenetic comparisons of the nucleotide sequences of the genome segment encoding the VP7(T13) proteins of ORUV, LEBV and CGLV, aligned with those of other Orbivirus species.The nucleic acid sequences were aligned based on the profile of aa alignments generating a codon to codon alignment, showing the three groups of orbiviruses (i-Culicoides?/sandfly-borne, ii- mosquito-borne and iii- tick-borne) as separate clusters. LEBV, ORUV and CGLV all cluster among Culicoides-borne orbiviruses. The scale bar represents the number of substitutions per site."
