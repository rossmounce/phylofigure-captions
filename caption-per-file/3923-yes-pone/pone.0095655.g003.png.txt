Evolutionary relationships of AsV-resistant bacteria (MS-AsV) 16S rRNA sequences.A total of 40 nucleotide sequences and 721 sites were analyzed. The phylogeny was reconstructed by maximum likelihood and TrN+G+F was selected as best fit model. Support values for each node were estimated using the Akaike Likelihood Ratio Test (aLRT). Only support values higher than 70% are shown. Reference sequences retrieved from the non-redundant database of the NCBI are shown in black, bacterial isolates (MS-AsIII and MS-AsV) in green. Different background colors highlight three well-supported clades: Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, and Proteobacteria. Thermodesulfobacteria was used as outgroup."
