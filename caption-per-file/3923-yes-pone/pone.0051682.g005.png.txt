"pone.0051682.g005.png","Phylogenetic analysis of PatAL and HetF homologs in C. raciborskii.Maximum-likelihood phylogenetic trees of (A) PatA, (B) PatL, and (C) HetF. Branches are colored by their support value (Shimodaira-Hasegawa test, low [blue] to high [red]). C. raciborskii and R. brookii sequences are colored in pink for clarity. Clades including the canonical heterocyst differentiation proteins are shaded in green while non-canonical heterocystous clades are shaded in yellow. Scale bar shows expected substitutions per site. In (C), the ?[01]? suffix for Rapb|28289569 indicates that the sequence is a concatenation of two neighboring ORFs (see Information S1 for details)."
