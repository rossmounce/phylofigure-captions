Two alternative hypotheses for the internal syndermatan phylogeny.Alternative hypotheses for the internal syndermatan relationships are (A) the morphology-based Lemniscea hypothesis [45], and (B) the Hemirotifera hypothesis [35], which is mainly based on molecular data. The latter did not specify the sister group of Acanthocephala. Support for a potential sister group relationship of Acanthocephala and Seisonidea (Pararotatoria) comes from morphological data [22], [23] and analyses of partial 18S rRNA sequences [26]."
