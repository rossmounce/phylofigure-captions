"pone.0012637.g001.png","Genetic relatedness among Leptospira isolates based on FAFLP analysis.(See supplementary information, tables S1 and S2 for details.) Clades roughly corresponding to different species types have been marked in different colors. Major clades and minor clades have been identified by code names (A to K) which overlap with the designation of similar clades identified by MLST technique. Identities of individual isolates need not be comprehensible in the tree itself, but they can be read clearly in the supplementary Table S2. The phylogenetic tree was rendered and visualized by MEGA3.0 software."
