Unrooted rectangular cladogram illustrating the phylogenetic relationship between piscidins.The SYM+G model was selected for the Bayesian analysis and the consensus tree was built after burning 1,250 trees from the 5·105 generations. The likelihood phylogeny was obtained with a HKY nucleotide substitution model with a discrete γ distribution (4 categories, γ shape parameter 2.0) and 100 bootstrap data sets. Bayesian posterior probabilities and maximum likelihood bootstrap values are indicated as percentages above and below the tree nodes, respectively."
