"pone.0023526.g002.png","Maximum likelihood (ML) phylogeny of Radiolaria inferred from an 18S rDNA alignment consisting of 158 taxa and 1438 characters. Values at nodes represent bootstrap support values from ML analysis and Bayesian posterior probabilities (pp) (ML/pp). Filled circle indicate maximum support in both analyses. Only values above 70% and 0.85 pp are shown (except at a few backbone nodes) and only at selected nodes due to space constraints. Hyphen indicates values below the threshold. Values in parentheses indicate support values when the analyses were run without Foraminifera (ML/pp) and are only shown for the main groups."
