HPV6 LCR phylogenetic tree from Australia and other geographical regions.A maximum likelihood (ML) tree was inferred from molecular phylogenetic analysis of 105 aligned LCR sequences using MEGA5 based on the Tamura-Nei model with 500 bootstrap replicates [66]. These 105 sequences were derived from Australia (KC300093?KC300140, KC333888), Slovenia (FM876166?FM876210) and South Africa (JN573163?JN573174). Reference sequences are shown in grey for lineage A (X00203), and sublineages B1 (AF092932) and B3 (L41216). The 38 variants are named by the lineage and sublineage they cluster to. Lineage A was comprised of one Australian (A-2), one Slovenian (A-3) and two geographically shared (A-1, A-4) variants. Lineage B, specifically sublineage B1 was comprised of Australian (B1?4, B1?5, B1?9, B1?10, B1?12, B1?13, B1?14, B1?15, B1?16, B1?17, B1?18, B1?20, B1?21, B1?24, B1?25, B1?26, B1?27, B1?28, B1?29), Slovenian (B1?1, B1?3, B1?6, B1?7, B1?11, B1?19, B1?22) and geographically shared (B1?2, B1?8, B1?23 ) variants, and lineage B3 was comprised of Australian (B3?4, B3?5), South African (B3?1, B3?3) and geographically shared (B3?2). In cases where sequences were identical only one sequence from each counrty was use to represent each variant. In six instances variants from different geographical regions were identical; A?1, A?4 and B1?2 (Australia and Slovenia), B3?2 (Slovenia and South Africa), B1?8 and B1?23 (Australia, Slovenia and South Africa)."
