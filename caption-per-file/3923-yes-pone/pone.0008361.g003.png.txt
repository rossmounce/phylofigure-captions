Maximum parsimony analysis of 27 parA proteins.Exclusion of gaps left 166 amino acids for the analysis; 8 amino acids were constant, 2 of the variable amino acids were parsimony uninformative and 156 of the variable amino acids were parsimony informative. Bootstrap analysis involved 1,000 replicates: numbers at selected branches are the NJ (MP/NJ) bootstrap values that were ≥50%. The top two or three blastP hits to rickettsial plasmid parA's with E = >1e−30 were chosen for the analysis. The parA from the Trichoplax adhaerens genome project is likely from a bacterium associated with this simplest of eukaryotes as several contigs have homology to Rickettsiales. The parA proteins from the rickettsial endosymbiont of Ixodes scapularis (REIS) were added to the analysis following PCR and sequencing to confirm the presence of the genes in our REIS isolate (Baldridge et. al., in preparation). Maximum parsimony and neighbor joining (not shown) phylograms were congruent. Genbank references for the proteins found in Text S7."
