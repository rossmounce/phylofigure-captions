Alignment of multiple sequences and phylogenic analysis of microRNA156 pre-miRNAs in date palm.A) Alignment of twelve pre-miRNA sequences of miR156. The box to the right indicates the mature miRNA region. The box to the left indicates the star miRNA region. B) Phylogenic tree (formed by Neighbor Joining) for miRNA in the miR156 family. C) Blast2 results for two pairs of paralogous date palm contigs containing pre-miR156. Squares highlight the location of the pre-miRNAs."
