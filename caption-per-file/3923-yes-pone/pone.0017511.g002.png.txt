Cytochrome-b haplotype network in L. saxatilis across the North Atlantic. Those haplotypes restricted to NWA are coloured white; those haplotypes restricted to NEA are coloured gray; and those haplotypes shared across the North Atlantic are displayed as pie-diagrams showing their frequencies in NWA and NEA. Bold circles indicate haplotypes found in more than one locality; the rest are private and found in only one sample. Large bubbles depict haplotypes with frequencies of 10 or more, and small bubbles depict haplotypes with frequencies below 10. Monophyletic clades from a Bayesian phylogenetic analysis are indicated by rounded rectangles; haplotypes outside these rectangles all belong to clade A."
