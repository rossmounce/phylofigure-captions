"pone.0085343.g003.png","The neighbor-joining phylogenetic analysis of SUMO-1 protein.Phylogenetic tree of aligned amino-acid sequences of sumo-1 from Artemia sinica and 20 other species. A neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree was constructed using sumo-1 sequences from A. sinica and 20 other sequences from GenBank, using the sequence analysis tool MEGA 4.1. The sequences and their accession numbers are indicated in the legend of Fig. 2. A circle (?) indicates sumo-1 from A. sinica."
