Analysis of selected aptamer candidate sequences. A. Motif (phylogeny) tree of sequences with ≥10 counts (108 sequences), in the experiment summarized in Table 2. Motif I at the upper right (blue) binds thrombin, motif II at the lower right (red) binds carbohydrates, while “jump” sequences (black) at the left are PCR-artifacts. B. SPR analysis of top contenders from each motif. Thb1 is the top candidate in motif Ia (close relatives of Thb1) and binds strongly to thrombin (upper SPR trace, blue). The top candidate in motif Ib (distant relatives of Thb1, see Table 3) was counted ∼1,000 times less than Thb1 and binds weakly (green trace). Motif II also binds weakly to thrombin (red trace). The SPR signal, Δ%R, is the change in reflectivity of the chip surface in response to analyte."
