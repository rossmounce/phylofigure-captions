Phylogenetic reconstruction based on partial psbAncr of common Symbiodinium ITS types characterized from locations throughout the Indo-Pacific (see map). Despite originating from geographically remote locations, psbAncr haplotypes of particular ITS types group to form clades separated by considerable sequence divergence from other ITS types. A diverse monophyletic lineage consisting of different ITS2 types associates exclusively with coral species in the genus Montipora. These are divergent from ‘ancestral’ host-generalist lineages C3, C21, and C27. The inset (shaded grey) is a corresponding ITS2 phylogeny showing how, despite minimal sequence divergence, its topology reflects that of the psbAncr tree."
