"pone.0058294.g002.png","Phylogenomic tree showing the evolutionary distance of V. volvacea with different fungal species.Rhizopus oryzae (zygomycete) was used as an outgroup. The topology of the phylogenomic tree was constructed by the neighbor-joining method [85] (bootstrap ?=?1000, JTT matrix). All bootstrap values are 100%. Time scale was showed by MYA (million years ago). The divergence time of species is located on the right side of each node. The average deviation of divergence time for each node time is only 0.23 MYA."
