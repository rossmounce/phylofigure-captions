"pone.0072448.g004.png","ML phylogenetic trees of HIV-1 CRFs_cpx pol (?1000 pb) sequences.A) HIV-1 CRF18_cpx from Cuba (n?=?62), were combined with those isolated in African (n?=?12), American (n?=?1) and European (n?=?2) countries. The tree was rooted using HIV-1 subtype G reference sequences (black branches). B) HIV-1 CRF19_cpx sequences from Cuba (n?=?160) and European countries (n?=?3) were combined with subtype D sequences of African origin (n?=?1,112). Branches are colored according to the origin of each sequence, as indicated at the legend (bottom left). Shaded boxes highlight the position of the major HIV-1 CRF18_cpx (CRF18CU) and CRF19_cpx (CRF19CU) Key nodes with aLRT support values >0.80 (*) and ?0.90 (**) are indicated. The branch lengths are drawn to scale with the bar at the bottom indicating nucleotide substitutions per site."
