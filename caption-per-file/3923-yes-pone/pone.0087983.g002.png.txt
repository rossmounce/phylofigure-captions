"pone.0087983.g002.png","Maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree of all rat MRSA samples.2a: Branch color represents cluster: Green  =  Cluster 1; Pink  =  Cluster 2; Yellow  =  Cluster 3; Orange  =  Cluster 4. Labels give isolate ID and date. MLST, spa type, and presence of PVL shown in right columns. Abbreviations: ST =  Sequence Type; tNew  =  New spa type with 3 repeat insertion from t008. Scale bar represents the average number of substitutions per site. 2b: Maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree of all rat and human MRSA ST8 samples. Labels give isolate ID, sample location and date. Text color represents sample isolation location: Red  =  Rat; Dark blue  =  Human DTES; Pale blue  =  Human other. MLST, spa type and presence of PVL shown in right columns. Abbreviations: DTES =  Downtown East Side; CA =  Community-acquired; HA =  Hospital-acquired; ST =  Sequence Type; tNew =  New spa type with 3 repeat insertion from t008. Scale bar represents the average number of substitutions per site."
