Maximum likelihood phylogenies of the ppGpp synthetase and hydrolase domains. Trees were generated from RaxML analyses of alignments of A) the ppGpp hydrolase (HD) domain-containing dataset (168 amino acid positions, 1535 sequences), and B) the ppGpp synthetase (SYNTH) domain-containing dataset (670 amino acid positions, 1706 sequences). In both trees, subgroups are labeled and shading behind the branches shows the most common domain structure observed for those groups, as per the legend in the inset box. Symbols on branches indicate bootstrap support, as per the inset box. In cases where the whole subgroup carries both the HD and SYNTH domain (Rel, SpoT, RelA, Rsh1-4, RshA-D), bootstrap support comes from the full length long RSH tree (supplementary file SI2). Branch length is proportional to the number of substitutions per site (see scale bar)."
