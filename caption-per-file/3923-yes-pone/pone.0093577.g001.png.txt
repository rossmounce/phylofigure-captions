"pone.0093577.g001.png","Characterization and sequence analysis of GhWRKY40.(A) Alignment of the amino acid sequences of GhWRKY40 and the representative related proteins AtWRKY18 (NP_567882), BnWRKY18 (ACN89257), AtWRKY40 (NP_178199) and BnWRKY40 (ACQ76806). Amino acids with 100% identity are shaded in black. The approximately 60-amino acid WRKY domain and the C and H residues in the zinc-finger motif (C-X4–5-C-X22–23-H-X1-H) are marked by a two-headed arrow and dot, respectively. The highly conserved amino acid sequence WRKYGQK in the WRKY domain is boxed. The putative nuclear localization signals are marked by lines. (B) Phylogenetic relationship between GhWRKY40 and other plant WRKY proteins. A neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree was created using MEGA 4.1 software. GhWRKY40 is boxed. Each gene name is followed by its protein ID. The abbreviations of the gene names are indicated as follows: Gh, Gossypium hirsutum; At, Arabidopsis thaliana; Os, Oryza sativa; Bn, Brassica napus; Cs, Cucumis sativus and Gm, Glycine max."
