"pone.0033010.g002.png","Phylogenetic relationships between the A/mallard/Sweden/7206/2004(H7N7) isolate and representative H7 sequences available in public databases. Bayesian phylogeny of HA amino acid sequences (denoted by GenBank accession number and isolated description) was inferred using the MrBayes 3.1.2 program and the Jones model of substation with gamma-distributed rate variation across sites. Nodes with posterior probability support â‰¥95% are indicated. The Swedish H7 sequence isolated is highlighted in bold face. Scale bar indicates the number of amino acid changes per branch length."
