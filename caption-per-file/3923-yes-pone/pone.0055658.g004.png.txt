Neighbour-joining phylogenetic tree based on 16S rRNA gene sequences of isolates 4.1, 4.2, 9.3 and 11.5, as well as strain 2362 and some other strains belonging to related taxa.The evolutionary distances are based on the Kimura 2-parameter model. Bootstrap values (>50%) based on 1000 replications are shown at branch nodes. Gene Bank accession numbers are given in parentheses. Paenibacillus polymyxa NCDO 1774T was used as outgroup. Phylogenetic analysis was performed using MEGA version 4."
