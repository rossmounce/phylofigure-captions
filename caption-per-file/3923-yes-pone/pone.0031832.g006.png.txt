Phylogenetic and nucleotide composition suggests Varpa_4680 entered the V. paradoxus EPS genome by horizontal transfer. A) Phylogenetic tree based on WbuB amino acid sequences created using ClustalW multiple sequence alignment and subsequent Bayesian inference of phylogeny(Mr. Bayes). B) Phylogenetic tree using the 16s rDNA sequences from the same set of organisms as in (A), using Bayesian inference of phylogeny based on the HKY85 nucleotide substitution model. For both A) and B) Vp EPS = Variovorax paradoxus EPS, Pn = Polaromonas naphthlenivorans CJ2, Bp = Bordatella pertussis Tohama 1, Pao1 = Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1, Cv = Chromobacterium violaceum ATCC 12472, Sd = Sulfurimonas denitrificans DSM 1251 C) G/C analysis of 35 kb region of the V. paradoxus EPS genome including wbuB. Total region spans orfs Varpa_4661-4691. Low G/C region from 18.4 kb to 27.1 kb spans orfs Varpa_4679-4684."
