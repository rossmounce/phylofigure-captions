Phylogenetic analysis of profilin. Neighbor-Joining (NJ) method was used to perform a phylogenetic analysis of the deduced protein sequences of O. europaea L. (blue), B. pendula (magenta), C. avellana (pink), P. pratense (green), and Z. mays (orange) profilin. Reference sequences of profilin from different species previously deposited in the GenBankTM/EMBL database were highlighted by underline."
