"pone.0059361.g001.png","Maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree based on the SSU rRNA gene of select Deltaproteobacteria isolates as well as full-length clones from the Human Oral Microbiome Database [3].The tree was reconstructed using PHYML [84] in the program Geneious? Pro 5.6.5 with a GTR (+ gamma+invariant sites) substitution model. Sequences from the present study are in blue text. Other host-associated sequences are denoted by blue (oral) or green (gut/rumen) boxes. The scale bar indicates 0.08 substitutions per nucleotide position. Numbers given at the nodes represent bootstrap percentages calculated on 100 replicates."
