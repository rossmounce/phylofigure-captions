"pone.0049992.g002.png","Sequence comparisons of J, CQ92, GX4 and SH06 rabies virus isolates.(A) A comparison of the genomic sequence of RABV isolates J, CQ92, GX4 and SH06. Strain CQ92 was used as the query. The y-axis gives the percentage of identity within a sliding window of 300 bp centered on the position plotted, with a step size between plots of 20 bp. The left side of (B), (C) and (D) panels showed the variant sites of CQ92 and its parent lineage representatives GX4 and SH06 in different genomic regions. The identity between CQ92 and its parent lineages is also shown in the middle of each panel. The variant sites identical to GX4 and SH06 are shaded in pink and grey, respectively. The right side of each panel shows the analysis of homology between CQ92 and parental lineages to show the different origins of CQ92. The phylogenetic histories of each region were inferred using the neighbor-joining method with a Tamura 3-parameter model. The robustness of each tree was tested by bootstrapping with 1000 replicates. Bootstrap values are shown beside the branches. (B) Positions 172?616. (C) Positions 1?171 and 617?941. (D) Positions 942?1423."
