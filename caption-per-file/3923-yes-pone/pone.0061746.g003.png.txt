"pone.0061746.g003.png","Diploid structure of Prdm9 ZF domains in equids.Number and sequence of ZF domains are depicted, with individual?s gender shown. Color/letter coded ZF domains correspond to Figure 2. Lineage-specific ZF domains are mapped on the phylogeny of equids according to [33]. Domestic horse individuals showed the same Prdm9 sequence for the last exon, thus only one sequence is depicted. The onager Prdm9 sequence obtained from cDNA is designated by an asterisk."
