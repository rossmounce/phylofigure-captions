Dendrogram describing the dissimilarity (1-similarity) among the sampling sites (A).The groups were clustered using the UPGMA algorithm and the Jaccard similarity coefficient based on the observed richness. The clone libraries are denoted as follows: the letters (d), (e) and (f) correspond to the alkB-targeting primers described in Table 2, and the sampling sites (sI, sR, sY, s3 and sC) are described in the Materials and Methods. (B) and (C) Venn diagrams of all alkB phylotypes detected in each sampling site using a distance level of 97% similarity."
