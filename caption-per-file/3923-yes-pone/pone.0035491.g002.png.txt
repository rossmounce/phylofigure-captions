"pone.0035491.g002.png","HIV-1 subtype C phylogenetic relationship and diversity of HIV non-structural genes is consistent with the multiplicity of HIV-1 infection determined by analysis of the env/gag genes.A maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree was reconstructed using Fastree2 (Price et al., 2010) using the GTR+G model for nucleotide substitution and visualized in Figtree v.1.1.3 [54]. Alternative likelihood ratio tests [55] >0.95 are shown by an asterisk. Subjects infected with multiple viral variants are colored red. Patient B and D subtrees (individual trees on grey background) show branching topology of earliest sampling (0â€“90 days p/s) and represent examples of single (subject B) and multiple (subject D) HIV-1 transmission."
