Molecular phylogeny of siphonophores from Dunn et(fig. 6[10]).Consensus tree of all trees for the Bayesian analysis of the combined data set (from an initial 20 million trees). The left score above the branch is the Bayesian posterior probability (%), the right score above the branch is the ML bootstrap support value (%), and the score below the branch is the MP bootstrap support value (%). The bars to the right of the species names indicate clades and grade taxa. Abbreviations: Atl – Atlantic; Med – Mediterranean; Pac – Pacific. For full details of analyses and consensus tree computations refer to Dunn et al. [10]."
