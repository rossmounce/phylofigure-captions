Phylogenetic tree of EctC- and EctD-type proteins.The shown phylogenetic tree is based on the alignment of EctC amino acid sequences identified by a BLAST search at the JGI Web-server that were then aligned using ClustalW. These compiled amino acid sequences were then used to assess the phylogenetic distribution of the EctC protein using the iTOL Web-server. Evolutionary distances are not given. The color code indicates the distribution of EctC among members of the Bacteria and Archaea. The presence of an ectD gene in a given microbial species possessing ectC is indicated by black (ectD is part of the ect gene cluster) or red circles (ectD is located outside of the ect gene cluster). Purple circles are indicating the presence of an ask_ect gene associated with the ect gene cluster, whereas the presence of an ectR regulatory gene is indicted by green circles. If different strains of the same species were sequenced, only one representative symbolizes them. For instance, there are genomic data of 139 strain of Vibrio cholerae available in the database, each of which possesses an ectABC gene cluster, but only one of these sequences was used for the phylogenetic analysis."
