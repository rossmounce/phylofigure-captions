"pone.0022420.g001.png","Phylogenetic tree of A. actinomycetemcomitans and related species based on housekeeping genes. The phylogenetic relationships of A. actinomycetemcomitans, A. aphrophilus, Haemophilus spp. and M. haemolytica strains were examined with 25 housekeeping gene (a total length of 17,840 bp) sequences. Bootstrap values (100 replicates) are given at branch points. Bar represents substitutions per site. M. haemolytica strain PHL213 was used to root the tree. Serotype information is given for all A. actinomycetemcomitans strains. The phylogenetic tree was constructed and drawn using PHYLIP version 3.6."
