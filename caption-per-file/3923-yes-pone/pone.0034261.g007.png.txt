"pone.0034261.g007.png","Comparison of Topology and Resampling Statistics for Various Tree Construction Methods.Collapsed unrooted phylogenetic trees for DANGER superfamily generated using (A) PHYRN-NJ, (B) MUSCLE-MrBayes, (C) MUSCLE-PhyML, (D) MUSCLE-NJ, (E) CLUSTAL-NJ and (F) TCOFFEE-NJ. For PHYRN trees the statistics are represented by two numbers with Bootstrap listed first followed by Jacknife statistics. Statistics for panel A were calculated from resampling results from 3000 replicates. Bootstrap statistics for panels B-F were calculated from resampling results from 1000 replicates."
