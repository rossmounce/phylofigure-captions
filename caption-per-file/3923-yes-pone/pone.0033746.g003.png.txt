"pone.0033746.g003.png","Venn diagrams showing overlaps in protein coding capacities between known euglenid plastid genomes and the plastid genome of Pyramimonas parkeae. The schematic representation of genome relationships is indicated in the left. Arrows indicate the probable fate of the genes absent from euglenid genomes. The genes are colour coded in respect to the functional group of their products: housekeeping proteins (black), proteins involved in photosynthesis (green), maturases of introns (red) and genes with unknown function (gray). Maturases of introns included in the phylogenetic tree of maturases (Figure S1) are marked by asterisks."
