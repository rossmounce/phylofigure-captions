"pone.0035314.g003.png","Phylogenetic composition of Verrucomicrobia SAGs.(A) Maximum likelihood phylogenetic analysis of the SSU rRNA gene sequences. Bootstrap (1000 replicates) values ≥50 are displayed. Each phylotype, indicated in red (coastal) or blue (freshwater) is formed by SAGs with ≥99% SSU rRNA gene sequence similarity. Five SAGs from the most abundant putative polysaccharide degrader phylotype in the coastal sample were selected for whole genome sequencing (red star). (B) Phylotype relative abundances in SAG libraries generated using various fluorescent probes. (nd) = not detected in a SAG library."
