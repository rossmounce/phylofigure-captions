"pone.0063098.g001.png","Maximum likelihood phylogenetic reconstruction of NS1-coding RNA sequences using db415 (415 cluster-representative sequences).A GTR+I+?4 model was used to estimate evolutionary rate differences among sites with a bootstrap value of 500. The tree with the highest likelihood was visualized using FigTree 1.3.1 (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/). Darker and thicker lines correlate with higher bootstrap values in branches (>50%). Nodes with the lowest bootstrap values (0.1 or less) were intentionally left white to emphasize uncertainty. The H1N1 A/Brevig Mission/1918 sequence fitted closer to the (A3, A4) node. A1(EQ1) and A2(Gull) share many sequence features with A5(Avian), but their long branches and distances (Table 2) granted them recognition as different A subtypes."
