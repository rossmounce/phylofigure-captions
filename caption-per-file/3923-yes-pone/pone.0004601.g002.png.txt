Phylogenetic analysis of the PBS light-harvesting gene family.A maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree of the PBS alpha subunit N-terminal amino-acid sequences greater than 80 amino acids in length. (a) Phylogenetic analysis of subunit peptides (CpcA, CpeA and ApcA) obtained at the GOS stations. Shading indicates the environmental location of recovered sequences as coastal (dark blue) or open-ocean (light blue). Only one Prochlorococcus cpeA gene (associated with CpeA_9303) is found in the GOS dataset. The tree was rooted from the middle point. Four groups are resolved. The bar corresponds to the average substitution per site. Bootstrapping support numbers are shown. The pie chart (b) represents the metagenomic profile of LH genes identified at open-ocean or coastal locations. Referred sequences (unshaded): CpeA_7803, C-phycoerythrin class I alpha chain of Synechococcus sp. WH7803 (YP_001224209); CpeA 8102, C-phycoerythrin class II alpha chain of Synechococcus sp. WH8102 (NP_898100); CpeA_9303, Phycoerythrin alpha chain of Prochlorococcus marinus str. MIT9303 (YP_001018237); rpc_8103, R-phycocyanin alpha chain of Synechococcus sp. WH8103 (P11394); CpcA_9917, Phycocyanin alpha chain of Synechococcus sp. RS9917 (ZP_01080760); ApcA_6301, allophycocyanin alpha chain of Synechococcus elongatus PCC 6301 (YP_171896)."
