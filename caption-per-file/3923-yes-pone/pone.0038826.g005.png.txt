"pone.0038826.g005.png","Maximum likelihood tree of K+ channel acid sequences from phycodnaviruses and host cells C. variabilis and E. siliculosus.Alignment was constructed with the use of MUSCLE [45]. The phylogenetic tree was constructed using PhyML [47] available at Phylogeny.fr [48] using WAG matrix and gamma distribution. Branch labels indicate bootstrap percentages (â‰¥50%) after 100 replicates. The tree is essentially an unrooted tree. Viral K+ channels are indicated in blue, channels from green algae C. variabilis and C. reinhardtii in red. The channels from viruses, which replicate in C. variabilis or E. siliculosus are highlighted by a grey or yellow background respectively."
