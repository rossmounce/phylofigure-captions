Phylogenetic Analyses. An aligned data set of 61 protein-coding genes from 15 taxa of the order Poales was used for phylogenetic analyses. The evolutionary history was inferred using the Maximum Parsimony (A) and Maximum Likelihood (B) methods. The percentage of replicate trees in which the associated taxa clustered together in the bootstrap tests (500 replicates) are shown next to the branches. There were a total of 41,397 positions in the final dataset. Evolutionary analyses were conducted in MEGA5 [67]. All positions containing gaps and missing data were eliminated. Subfamily groupings are indicated by solid lines on the right margin."
