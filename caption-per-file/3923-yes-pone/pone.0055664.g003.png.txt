"pone.0055664.g003.png","Maximum Likelihood phylogenetic tree for SxtF/SxtM and its homologues in Nostoc sp. and Vibrio cholerae.The dendrogram was inferred with a JTT amino acid substitution model, uniform rate and a bootstrap of 1000 replications (only values over 60% are shown) (MEGA version 5). The subdivisions of the tree correspond to the two different types of transporters, whose amino acid sequence in the two specific recognition motifs (Cation and Toxin), are given in the right part of the figure. The cyanobacterial branch is marked in green. SxtM recognition motifs are shown in a pink rectangle and SxtF motifs in a yellow rectangle. The toxin recognition motif of SxtM2 from L. wollei contains a non- expected amino acid sequence (orange rectangle), corresponding to an amino acid mixture: in position 399 there is a V (Valine) similar to SxtF toxin motif, and in position 402 there is a Q (Glutamine), similar to SxtM. CR: C. raciborskii; Raph: Raphidiopsis; Apha: Aphanizomenon; AC: A. circinalis; LW: L. wollei ? PmC: Peltigera membranacea cyanobiont; VC: Vibrio cholerae."
