Phylogenetic analysis of the RCAN3 exons in vertebrates.The human RCAN3 genomic sequences corresponding to first exons (exon 1, 2 and 3) and to exon 4 untranslated regions (5? UTR), coding region (exon 4, 5, 6 and 7) and exon 7 untranslated region (3? UTR) were compared with the sequences of several vertebrate RCAN3 orthologs. DNA sequences for the different species were retrieved from the Ensembl database [32] and used for subsequent phylogenetic analysis, as described in the Material and Methods section. All primate genomic sequences appear as very closely related sequences, while rodent sequences (Mus musculus, Rattus norvegicus and Cavia porcellus) are the most divergent of all the mammals in all cases, except for exon 2, exon 3 and the short 5?UTR sequence on exon 4. The species studied and the genome sequence versions used were: Homo sapiens (v.GRCh37.p7 Feb 2009), Pan troglodites (panTro, Chimpanzee; v.2.1.4 Feb 2011), Gorilla gorilla (gorGor, v.3.1 Dec 2009), Pongo abelii (ponAbe, Orangutan; v.2 Sep 2007), Macaca mulatta (rheMac; v.1.0 Feb 2006), Callithrix jacchus (calJac, Marmoset; v.3.2.1 Jan 2010), Cavia porcellus (cavPor, Guinea Pig; v.3 Mar 2008), Sus scorfa (susSco, Pig; v. 10.2_Aug 2011), Mus musculus (musMus, Mouse; v.37 Apr 2007), Rattus norvegicus (rarNor, Rat; v.3.4 Dec 2004), Oryctolagus cuniculus (oryCun, Rabbit; v.2 Nov 2009), Ailuropoda melanoleuca (ailMel, Panda; v.1 Jul 2009), Canis lupus familiaris (canFam, Dog; v.2.0 May 2006), Bos taurus (bosTau, Cow; v.3.1 Nov 2009), Tursiops truncates (turTru, Dolphin; v.1 Jul 2008), Loxodonta africana (loxAfr, Elephant; v.3.0 Jul 2009), Myotis lucifugus (myoLuc, Microbat; v.2.0 Sep 2010). Numbers at the tree nodes correspond to bootstrap values. The scale bar in the bottom refers to the branch lengths and the number indicates substitutions per site."
