"pone.0059001.g005.png","Maximum likelihood phylogeny of 160 concatenated red algal plastid genes.Major lineages are shaded and named to the right (Cya Cyaninidiales; Por Porphyridiales; Ban Bangiales; Flo florideophytes). The phylogeny is fully supported except for the node uniting G. lanceola and G. tenuistipitata, for which RAxML rapid boostrap (left) and PhyML SH-aLRT supports (right) are shown for trees both including Cyanidiales (above) and excluding them (below)."
