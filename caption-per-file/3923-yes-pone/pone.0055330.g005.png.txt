"pone.0055330.g005.png","Unrooted phylogenetic tree of insect OBP proteins.The phylogenetic reconstruction was generated with MEGA version 4.0.2 software [35]. In red is shown the Tc OBP up-regulated upon Cry3Ba and Cry23Aa/Cry37Aa treatment challenge and in green, homologous Tc OBPs identified searching the BeetleBase protein database. Depicted in blue are other coleopteran OBPs, in grey lepidopteran OBPs, in yellow dipteran OBPs and in pink hymenopteran OBPs, which were identified to show homology to Tc OBP by searching the NCBI protein database."
