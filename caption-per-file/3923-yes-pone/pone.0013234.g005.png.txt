"pone.0013234.g005.png","Two types of cyanobacterial Psb28 proteins.A Maximum parsimony phylogenetic tree based on cyanobacterial and eukaryotic Psb28 protein sequences (long branches excluded). The protein shows an occurrence of two basic sequential types (marked I and II). Numbers above branches indicate bootstrap supports as computed by Maximum parsimony (1000 replicates)/AsaturA (1000 replicates)/Maximum likelihood (500 replicates, WAG+I+Î“ with all parameters estimated form the dataset). B The two types show low mutual similarity (identity of amino acids do not overcome 32%). The type I Psb28 contains specific insertions indicated by black star."
