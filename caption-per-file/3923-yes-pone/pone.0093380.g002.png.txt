"pone.0093380.g002.png","Molecular phylogenetic analysis of vasa products by neighbor-joining method.The bootstrap consensus tree (1,000 replicates) represented the evolutionary history of the analyzed taxa. The evolutionary distances were computed using the Poisson correction method. The bootstrap value (%) of 1,000 replicates was shown next to the branches. Branches corresponding to partitions reproduced in less than 50% of the bootstrap replicates were collapsed. The GenBank accession numbers were shown in brackets after each species. Vas-l was clustered in the VASA subfamily in the teleost branch with the Vasa homologue from S. senegalensis (Soleoidei)."
