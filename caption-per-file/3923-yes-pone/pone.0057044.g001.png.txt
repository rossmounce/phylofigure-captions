The phylogenetic tree and gene structure analysis of the MdLBD proteins.The amino acid sequences of the LBD proteins were aligned with ClustalX, and the phylogenetic tree was constructed using the neighbor-joining method of MEGA 5.0 software. Each node is represented by a number that indicates the bootstrap value for 1000 replicates. The scale bar represents 0.1 substitutions per sequence position (left). The right side illustrates the exon-intron organization of the corresponding LBD genes. The exons and introns are represented by the green boxes and black lines, respectively. The numbers indicate the length of the exons or introns. The scale bar represents 1000 bp (right)."
