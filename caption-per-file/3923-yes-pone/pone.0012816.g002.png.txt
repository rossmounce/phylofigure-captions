"pone.0012816.g002.png","Phylogeny of alpha-HPVs and degradation of p53 by HPV E6 ORFs.HPV E6 activity on HA-p53 steady state levels were determined by Western blot using the assay shown in Figure 1A. The phylogenetic tree at the left was constructed using the combined early gene sequences as previously reported [35]. Epidemiological carcinogenicity was extrapolated from recent reviews [23], [24] and is indicated in the column labeled “carcinogenic risk”: +, highly oncogenic; , oncogenic; /−, probably oncogenic; −, not significantly associated with cervix cancer; NA, insufficient data. The p53 levels after co-transfection with E6 from each type indicated on the left are shown in the far right column labeled, “p53” (with and without MG132) and the results are summarized in the column labeled“↓p53”. Endogenous β-tubulin (far right column) represents a loading control. The alpha-HPV species groups are indicated by brackets with a number to the right. The empty vector control, pQCXIN is shown at the bottom."
