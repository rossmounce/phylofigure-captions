"pone.0052373.g001.png","Maximum clade credibility trees of the HIV-1 CRF07_BC sequences.Ancestral geographic states were constructed using Bayesian phylogeographic inference framework implemented in the BEAST V1.6.2 package. The tree branches are colored according to their respective geographical regions. The root on the trees represents the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of CRF07_BC. (A) The MCC tree constructed with the full-length gag sequences from 5 provinces; (B) The MCC tree constructed with the partial gag gene sequences (HXB2 2102?2601 nt) from 8 provinces; (C) The MCC tree constructed with the env C2V3 fragment (HXB2 7095?7328 nt) of subtype C from 9 provinces; (D) The MCC tree constructed on the env C2V3 fragment of subtype C from 8 provinces after the removal of sequences from Yunnan province."
