"pone.0017501.g001.png","Neighbour-joining phylogenetic tree constructed based on the nucleotide sequences of the noncoding region of TTSuV genomes. Bootstrap values are indicated above major branches. AB076001 and AY823990 are reference sequences for TTSuV1 and AY823991 is the reference strains for TTSuV2. Small letters (−a,−b,−c) after names refer to different sequences identified in a particular cell lineage (or trypsin batch)."
