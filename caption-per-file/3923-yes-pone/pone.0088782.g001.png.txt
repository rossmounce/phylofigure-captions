"pone.0088782.g001.png","The phylogenetic relationships of polymerase segments.The evolutionary phases of the PB2 (A), PB1 (B), and PA (C) segments of the swPL01 virus were inferred with those of NCBI-registered reference sequences by the ML method using MEGA5 [22]. The sequences with more than 95% bootstrap scores among the evolution branches of the swTx/98 virus and those of reference were used for the final ML tree evaluation. Virus subtypes were indicated inside parenthesis along with the respective abbreviation of hosts. Lineage definitions were indicated as: CS, classical swine; EA, Eurasian avian-like; and pH1N1, 2009 pandemic influenza A H1N1. The colors represent the following viruses: pink, A/swine/Texas/4199-2/1998 (swTx/98); green, Korean swine H3N2; red, A/swine/Korea/PL01/2012 (swPL01); and blue, 2009 pandemic influenza H1N1 viruses."
