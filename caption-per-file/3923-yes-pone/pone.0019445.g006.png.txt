Infrared spectra of mosasaur and Varanus fibrous tissues, collagen and various microbial structures. (A) Absorbance spectra of biofilms of Enterococcus faecalis and Propionibacterium acnes, isolated cells of the two bacteria, a collagen-like protein produced by Streptococcus pyogenes (SclB, as a fusion to GST), type I collagen, and fibrous tissues of Prognathodon (IRSNB 1624) and Varanus (LO 10298). Spectra from four different regions were co-added to produce the spectra for the microbial biofilms and planktonic cells (note, however, that the spectrum for P. acnes cells only includes three co-added spectra). The GST-ScIB spectrum consists of nine co-added spectra. Different numbers of spectra were used to obtain comparable signal-to-noise ratios. (B) Cluster analysis based on the spectral regions 1200–1800 and 2785–3730 cm−1 (peptide bond and lipid interval, respectively). Note that this is not a phylogeny. (C) Cluster analysis based on six arbitrary spatial regions from two samples of Prognathodon fibrous tissues (all having the same spectral resolution, 4 cm−1, and a similar signal-to-noise ratio) and six arbitrary spatial regions from two samples of Varanus osteoid."
