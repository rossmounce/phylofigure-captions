Phylogenetic relationships of partial sequences (nucleotides 346 to 866) of the HA1 coding fragment for A(H3N2) viruses isolated between 2002 and 2008 in the UK. The annotated box indicates the reference colours for viruses isolated in different influenza seasons, between 2002–2003 and 2007–2008. Genetic groups I and II, within the Fujian/411 clade, are indicated with brackets. Viruses from fatal cases are highlighted with #. Sequences from reference viruses A/Panama/2007/99 and A/Fujian/411/2002 were included in the phylogeny. The ML tree was rooted using A/Panama/2007/99 as an outgroup. Branch lengths are drawn to scale. Bootstrap values (>50%) and signature amino acid substitutions seen in viruses from 2003–2004 and 2004–05 are annotated on the nodes."
