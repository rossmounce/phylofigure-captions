GP-based phylogenetic tree. The members of the various Orders formed monophyletic clusters and showed good correspondence to the phenotype-based tree (i.e., the classical tree). Species that belong to the same Order are shown in the same color. Non-correspondences between the classical tree and the GP-based tree are indicated by lines which show the possible realignments necessary to make the two classifications match completely. The superscript star symbol indicates species that are present in Fig 2, panel C."
