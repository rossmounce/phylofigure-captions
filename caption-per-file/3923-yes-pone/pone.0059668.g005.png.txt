"pone.0059668.g005.png","Body size evolution in Lagomorpha.The phylogenetic structure was based on Bayesian inferences. The body lengths of terminal taxa were mainly from PanTHERIA [68] or calculated basing on museum collections. Body length of each node was inferred by parsimony methods. Colors on the branches show the change of body size. The units of body length are millimeters."
