Phylogenetic analysis of FTLSV strains isolated from Henan Province during 2011 and 2012, compared with other bunyaviruses.The phylogenetic tree was constructed by using the maximum likelihood method with the MEGA5 software. The reliability values indicated at the branch nodes were determined using 1,000 bootstrap replications. Isolated FTLSV strains in 2011 and 2012 from Henan Province were labeled by black solid triangles. Phylogenetic relationship of FTLSV with other bunyaviruses, based on the complete L, M, S segment sequences, are shown in panel A, B, C, respectively."
