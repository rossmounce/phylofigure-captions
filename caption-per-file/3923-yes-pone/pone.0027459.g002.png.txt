Maximum Likelihood (ML) consensus tree of the Envelope protein gene of DENV-2. A) The phylogenetic relationships between members of all DENV-2 genotypes based on the sequences of the Envelope protein gene. DENV-2 genotypes (Sylvatic, American, Asian I and II, Cosmopolitan and American/Asian) are identified. B) ML tree showing in details the relationships between Central American and Mexican isolates collected between 1999 and 2009. Similar sequences at the top of clades 2a and 2b are shown collapsed. A red circle and a yellow star denote strains GU/FDA-GUA09/2009 and GU/F07-030/2007, respectively. Consensus trees were generated by ML and Bayesian methods. Bootstrap support values of 1,000 replicates using the ML model of evolution and Bayesian posterior probability values are shown above and below each node. Only bootstrapping values >80 are shown. Branch lengths are proportional to the bar and represent the number of nucleotide substitutions between the analyzed viruses."
