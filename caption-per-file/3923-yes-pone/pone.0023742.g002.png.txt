"pone.0023742.g002.png","Maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree showing the diversity, geographic distribution and sub-clade groupings of the Polaromonas monophyletic clade. Tree is rooted with sequences of Rhodoferrax and Variovorax. Nodes with annotations are well supported by both Baysian and maximum-likelihood trees (posterior probability values above 60%, bootstrap support above 60%, respectively). Sequence names or accession numbers are color-coded by geographic regions. Guide sequences of well-described Polaromonas species and strains are shown to confirm that the clade depicted is equivalent to the genus Polaromonas."
