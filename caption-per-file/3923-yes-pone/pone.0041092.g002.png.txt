Phylogenetic analysis of vSOCS and SOCS family proteins from various species.The phylogenetic tree was constructed by bootstrap N-J method using MEGA 4.0. Bootstrap value was indicated at the node. Homologous vSOCS protein sequences from the three sequenced members of the genus Megalocytivirus (ISKNV, OSGIV, RBIV), mandarin fish (Siniperca chuatsi), stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus), medaka (Oryzias latipes), tetraodon (Tetraodon nigroviridis), fuge (Takifugu rubripes), zebrafish (Danio rerio), chicken (Gallus gallu), x.tropicalis (Xenopus tropicalis), bovine (Bos taurus), pig (Sus scrofa), dog (Canis familiaris), mouse (Mus musculus), rat (Rattus norvegicus), and human (Homo sapiens) were retrieved from the GenBank or the Ensemble database (the accession numbers indicated) and analyzed."
