Alignment and phylogenetic analysis of Ca-HMGB amino acid sequences with other animal HMGBs and DSP1s.(A) Multiple alignments. Conserved amino acids were shaded and each shade represents a degree of conservation (black, 100%, grey, 70%). The alignment was taken by ClustalX program. (B) Phylogenetic analysis was performed by MEGA (version 3.1) program. The phylogenetic tree was constructed using neighbor-joining method and bootstrap 1000. The Bombyx mori HMGA protein was taken as out-group root. (C) Sequences used in multiple alignments and phylogenic tree analysis together with their identity in amino acid sequences."
