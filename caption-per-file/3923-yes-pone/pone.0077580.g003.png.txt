"pone.0077580.g003.png","Phylogenetic reconstruction of androgen receptor sequences.Phylogenetic analysis of vertebrate androgen receptors using PhyML (upper values) and MrBayes (lower values). For analysis the coding regions of androgen receptor (ar) cDNAs were used. The position of the X. hellerii ara and arb orthologs within the phylogeny is highlighted (grey box)."
