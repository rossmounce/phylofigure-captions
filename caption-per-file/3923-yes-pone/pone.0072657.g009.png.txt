Genome size and chromosome number in apicomplexan species.Number of nuclear chromosomes and genome size are shown in panel on the right. Piroplasma taxa shown in dark color; B. microti stripped. Schematic of phylogenetic relationships among species shown on the left. Resolution of the interior node in the piroplasma clade marked with ?*? resolved according to [34], based on study with 150 nuclear genes. Resolution differs from that obtained with mitochondrial sequences (Fig. 8) and the 18S rDNA gene [6]."
