Phylogenetic and amino acid comparisons of the MSRBs.(A) Phylogenetic tree of the MSRBs from Arabidopsis thaliana (AtMSRB1: NP_564640, AtMSRB2: NP_567639, AtMSRB3: NP_567271, AtMSRB4: NP_192390, AtMSRB5: NP_192392, AtMSRB6: NP_192393, AtMSRB7: NP_567637, AtMSRB8: NP_193915, AtMSRB9: NP_567638), Oryza sativa (OsMSRB1.1: AK063588, OsMSRB1.2: AK111486, OsMSRB3: AK071730, OsMSRB5: AK068764), and Capsicum annuum (CaMSRB2: EF144171, CaMSRB1: EF144174, CaMSRB3: EF144173). The phylogenetic tree was constructed by ClustalW and Phylip package (Neighbor-joining method) with full-length sequences including transit peptides and visualized using TreeView. (B) The amino acid sequence alignment of the conserved SelR domain of the MSRBs from Arabidopsis thaliana, Oryza sativa, and Capsicum annuum was constructed using ClustalW (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/clustalo/). Four putative MSRB signature motifs are boxed, and two conserved Cys residues are indicated with arrows."
