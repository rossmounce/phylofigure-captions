"pone.0003667.g001.png","Evolution of the IR family.Maximum likelihood phylogeny of the IR family ectodomain inferred from amino acid sequences. The tree shown was the best one found (lnL = −30836.65814) amongst 41 independent tree searches (see Materials and Methods) for 55 vertebrate and 3 invertebrate IR family ectodomain homologues. The numbers on the bipartitions indicate the ML SH-like P values/Bayesian posterior probability support values. Only significant (P≥0.95) values are shown. An asterisk (*) indicates that the bipartition was not significantly supported (P[103] used to compute bipartition robustness under the ML criterion, or by the more liberal Bayesian posterior probabilities. NCBI taxonomic ranks are provided for some clades. The scale indicates the number of expected substitutions per site under the best fitting JTT+G model (shape parameter α = 0.865), which had a posterior probability of 1."
