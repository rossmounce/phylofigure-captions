"pone.0053134.g002.png","Molecular species circumscriptions and relationships in the Racomitrium canescens species complex.Single optimal maximum likelihood tree of 73 specimens based on combined plastid rps4-trnT-trnL and nrITS sequences. Racomitrium fasciculare and R. laevigatum were used as outgroup representatives. Thick lines indicate bootstrap support (BS) values from respective maximum parsimony and significant posterior probabilities (PP) from respective Bayesian analysis: BS>95% and PP>95 (black), BS>70% and PP>95 (dark grey), BS>70% or PP>95 (light grey). Asterisks indicate specimens whose identification was revised according to their position in the molecular phylogenetic reconstructions."
