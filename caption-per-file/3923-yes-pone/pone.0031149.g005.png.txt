"pone.0031149.g005.png","Phylogenetic relationship of HD-ZIP IV subfamily from eight plant species. Enlarged view of the phylogeny of HD-ZIP IV members from Figure 1A. The numbers at the nodes represent the bootstrap values (>50%) from 100 replicates. Scale bar indicates the estimated number of amino acid substitutions per site. Filled circles represent HD-ZIP proteins from different plant species. Colors correspond to plant taxa as indicated in Figure 1."
