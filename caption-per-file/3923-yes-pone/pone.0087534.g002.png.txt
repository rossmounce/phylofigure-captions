"pone.0087534.g002.png","Bayesian phylogenetic trees of (A) MHC class II ? exon 2, and (B) exon 3.Sequences of MHC class II ? among different species of Crocodylia, Aves and Mammalia are analysed using the shark Gici sequences as an outgroup. Brackets in the middle show vertebrate groups to which the MHC class II ? sequences belong. Sequences generated in the current study are from two families of Crocodylia: Crocodilidae (pale green colour) and Alligatoridae (pale red colour). TSPs associated with these sequences are described immediately after the sequence names. Support on branches is indicated by bootstrap values (BV) for maximum likelihood (above) and posterior probabilities (PP) for Bayesian analysis (below), as both analyses provide significantly similar trees described in the text. Branches with posterior probabilities below 0.5 are collapsed."
