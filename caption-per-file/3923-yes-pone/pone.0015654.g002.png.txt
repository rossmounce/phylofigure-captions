"pone.0015654.g002.png","Evolutionary history of ISWpi1 insertion and inversion at the wMel#2 locus. The phylogenetic tree of Wolbachia strain relationships is from [20]. Wolbachia strains are identified by the name of the host species from which they were isolated, except for the published genome sequences (“reference genomes”). Wolbachia strains with the ISWpi1 insertion at the wMel#2 locus are shown in a light-grey box and strains with the inverted ISWpi1 insertion are shown in a dark-grey box. All other strains lack the ISWpi1 insertion."
