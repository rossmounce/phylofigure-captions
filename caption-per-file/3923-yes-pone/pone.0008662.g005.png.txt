Phylogenetic tree based on 58 intB sequences.The phylogenetic tree is based on a neighbor-joining algorithm and 10,000 bootstrap iterations with Mega4.0 on intB sequences, showing the relationships among the 58 intB sequences included in this study. The scale bar represents a 1% difference in nucleotide sequence. Red: ECC isolates with identical intB sequences and otherwise genotyped as the EHOS. The tree is divided into three separate branches with high bootstrap values except for Klebsiella pneumoniae ICEkp1, which demonstrated low bootstrap values with other isolates, suggesting it is a separate cluster."
