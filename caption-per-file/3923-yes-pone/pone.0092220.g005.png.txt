Maintenance of a conserved Class 2 B1 receptor gene environment across metazoans.Metazoan Class 2 B1 receptors are annotated in bold and are colored according to the phylogenetic clustering obtained from Figure 2. Only genes common to all species are represented. Double bars within the chromosome lines represent interruption in the sequence and the length of the genomic region analyzed (Mb) is indicated within brackets. Colored blocks represent genes and when available gene symbols are given. The relative position of the gene on the chromosome is shown. For detailed information please see Table S7."
