"pone.0050984.g001.png","Relationship of the ASK gene family in Arabidopsis.The phylogenetic grouping of ASK genes based on their deduced primary amino acid sequence was calculated using the NJ method described. The genes are grouped into seven distinct clades as denoted by the vertical lines. Numbers at the branches represents percentage bootstrap support calculated for a 1000 replicates. All tree branches are scaled to the number of amino acid substations per site."
