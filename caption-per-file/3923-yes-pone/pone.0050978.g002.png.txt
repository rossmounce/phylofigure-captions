"pone.0050978.g002.png","Maximum likelihood phylogeny of LTR sequences from the Ty3/Ty3p super-family within Saccharomyces sensu stricto.The phylogeny was created from 983 aligned nucleotide positions. The branches are colour-coded based on the species labelled on the phylogeny. Individual sequence names have been omitted. Branches are drawn to scale and the bar represents the number of nucleotide substitutions per site. A ?*? denotes branches with both mlBP ?70% and biPP ?0.95 support."
