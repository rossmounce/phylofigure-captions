Bootstrap phylogenetic tree of DUF3233 with Va and Vb family proteins. 51 Va family (red), 25 Vb family (blue) translocation unit and 3 DUF3233 (green) representative sequences were used to generate a 1000 replicate bootstrap phylogenetic tree. Eukaryotic Vb sequences representing clusters 1 and 2 were not considered in the analysis. Sequences of each family are grouped into previously reported clusters (C 1 to 11 and C 1 to 4); DUF3233 sequences form a new cluster of the autotransporter family. Numbers at the node indicate neighbour-joining bootstrap percentages. Phylogenetic analyses were conducted in MEGA4."
