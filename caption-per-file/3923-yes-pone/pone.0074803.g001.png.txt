TCP ECE gene phylogeny in eudicots, rooted on monocot sequences.Phylogeny was inferred by ML analysis of the nucleotide sequences of the TCP, ECE and R domains (249 characters). Clades with â‰¥75% Shimodaira-Hasegawa (SH)-like support are shown; SH values are given below each branch; posterior probabilities (PPs) from the Bayesian analysis of the same dataset are given after. Sequence names of basal eudicots are in blue, and of Gunneratinctoria in red."
