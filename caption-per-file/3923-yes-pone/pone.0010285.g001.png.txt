Complete mtDNA phylogenetic tree of haplogroup U5.This schematic tree is based on two phylogenetic trees (for U5a and U5b) presented in Figures S1 and S2, respectively. Nomenclature of hg U5 subclusters was applied in accordance with the classification described in the Table S1. Some unnamed tips are singular haplotypes (e.g. U5a1*) aggregated for the purposes of illustration. Time estimates (in ky) shown for mtDNA subclusters are based on the complete mitochondrial genome clock [3]. The size of each circle is proportional to the number of individuals sharing the corresponding haplotype, with the smallest size corresponding to one individual. Geographical origins are indicated by different colors: eastern European – in blue, central European – in yellow, Mediterranean and western European – in fuchsia, and others (i.e. of unknown population origin) – in white. More detailed information on the origin of population samples can be found in Figures S1 and S2."
