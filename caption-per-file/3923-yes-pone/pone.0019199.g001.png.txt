"pone.0019199.g001.png","Phylogeny of the Australian rodents and reconstructed ancestry on key nodes in the phylogeny (labeled as nodes A–G). Bayesian posterior probabilities indicated at the nodes. Nodes supported by 1.00 are marked with “*”. Shapes beside terminal taxa designate species in the three Australian colonization stages (star = old endemics, circle = new endemics, and square = introduced species). All other rodent species are non-Australian and are presented for reference. Melomys rufescens and Pogonomys macrourus were used only for positioning these two genera on the phylogenetic tree, and served as a phylogenetic reference for the Australian species Melomys cervinipes and Pogonomys mollipilosus for which we had no genetic sequences. Line graphs on the right side of the figure show the values of the ancestral breeding parameter states. They are drawn for both the old endemics (gray line, nodes A, B, C, and D) and the new endemics (black line, nodes A, E, F, and G), starting at node A and increasing toward more recent nodes."
