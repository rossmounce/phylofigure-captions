Identification of the DOR gene family. Panel A. Phylogenetic tree showing the two well supported clusters corresponding to DOR and Tp53inp1 vertebrate sequences and indicating a duplication of the ancestral DOR gene in the common ancestor of vertebrates around 450–510 Mya [38]. The Maximum Likelihood tree was generated using the WAG model in RaxML. Jackknife and bootstrap values were computed and are shown on each node. The top circle represents the Jackknife Support value using the Gonnett scoring matrix in parsimony. The middle circle at each node represents the Jackknife Support value with all characters set as unordered. The bottom circle refers to the bootstrap support computed using likelihood (WAG model). The final ML Optimization Likelihood was −10910.664029. Panel B. Diagram depicting the absence of an alternative exon 2 internal splicing signal in Tp53inp1 genes. Exons shown correspond to the coding exons of the human genes. An alternative splicing signal present in exon 2 of DOR and absent in Tp53inp1 genes from bony fish to mammals suggests DOR is the ancestral gene. The phylogenetic tree is based on our recent understanding of relationships of major taxonomic groups."
