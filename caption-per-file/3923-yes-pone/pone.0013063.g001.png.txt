"pone.0013063.g001.png","Phylogenetic trees for HA (A), NA (B), M (C) and NS (D) genes of the H9N2 influenza viruses analyzed.Trees were generated by the neighbor-joining method with the MEGA program (version 4.1). Nucleotides 80–1090 (1011 bp, HA), 20–1420 (1401 bp, NA), 26–984 (959 bp, M) and 41–859 (819 bp, NS) were used for phylogenetic analysis. The HA phylogenetic tree is rooted to A/Duck/Alberta/60/76(H12N5), and the trees of NA, M, and NS are rooted to A/Equine/Praque/1/56(H7N7). The length of the horizontal lines is proportional to the minimum number of nucleotide differences required to join nodes. Vertical lines are for spacing and labeling. Viruses characterized in this study are highlighted in bold, representative H9N2 viruses are in red, viruses isolated from swine and human are in green, and H5N1 influenza viruses are highlighted with asterisk.
