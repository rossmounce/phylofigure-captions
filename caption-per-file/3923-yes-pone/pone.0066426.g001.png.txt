A rooted maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree of basdiomycete laccases perfectio sensu stricto.Laccases of L. edodes are in red, whereas others are individually colored. Numbers at nodes are bootstrap percentages (?50%) from 100 replicates. Branch lengths here did not represent evolutionary changes. The tree was rooted by using two ascomycetous sequences [Chaetomium globosum (Cg) and Neurospora crassa (Nc)]. Cc: Coprinopsis cinerea; Fm: Fomitiporia mediterranea; Sc: Schizophyllum commune; Ha: Heterobasidion annosum; Sh: Stereum hirsutum; Po: Pleurotus ostreatus; Gs: Ganoderma spp.; Ds: Dichomitus squalens; Tv: Trametes versicolor; Cs: Ceriporiopsis subvermispora; Ps: Punctularia strigosozonata. Numbers following the abbreviations refer to JGI protein IDs in the respective fungal genome."
