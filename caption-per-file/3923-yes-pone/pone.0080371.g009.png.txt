"pone.0080371.g009.png","Structure-based phylogenetic tree of MononegaviralesP proteins.The tree was built by aligning the experimentally determined structures of Sendai virus (SeV) (PDB ID: 1EZJ), Measles virus (MeV) (PDB ID: 3ZDO), Mumps virus (MuV) (PDB ID: 4EIJ), Rabies Virus (RV) (PDB ID: 3L32), Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) (PDB ID: 2FQM) and HMPV P oligomerization domains using SHP [43]. The obtained evolutionary distances were used to draw a tree in PHYLIP [77]."
