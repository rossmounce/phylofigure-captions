"pone.0028695.g001.png","Unrooted phylogenetic tree of Wolbachia 16S rRNA gene sequences. Strains are designated with the names of their host species, followed by the collection site and the sample name. Bayesian posterior probabilities (bottom number) and ML bootstrap values based on 1000 replicates are given. Wolbachia supergroups are shown to the right of the host species names. New supergroups are shaded while aphid Wolbachia strains that belong to supergroup A or B are boxed."
