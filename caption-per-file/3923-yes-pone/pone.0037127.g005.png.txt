Identification of Tomato necrotic stunt virus (ToNSV) in the Mexican sample (MX) and its relationship with other viruses in the family of Potyviridae.A. Relative placement of de novo assembled siRNA contigs onto a general potyvirus genome. B. Distribution of siRNAs along the ToNSV genome in both (+) and (âˆ’) polarities. C. Phylogenetic relationship of the newly identified ToNSV genome in relationship to other viruses in the family of Potyviridae. The full name of potyviruses and their respective GenBank accession numbers are: ToNSV-MX9354: JQ314463; PTMV, Peru tomato mosaic virus: AJ516010; PVY-O, Potato virus Y: HQ912914; PeSMV, Pepper severe mosaic virus: AM181350; PeMoV, Pepper mottle virus: EU586135; PVV, Potato virus V: NC_004010; PepYMV, Pepper yellow mosaic virus: NC_014327; BiMoV, Bidens mottle virus: EU250214; WMV, Watermelon mosaic virus: DQ399708; PVMV, Pepper veinal mottle virus: FM202327; TVBMV, Tobacco vein-banding mosaic virus: EF219408; TVMV, Tobacco vein mottling virus: X04083; and TEV, Tobacco etch virus: EF470242. SPMMV, Sweet potato mild mottle virus: NC_003739, genus Ipomovirus, was used as an outgroup sequence to anchor the phylogenetic tree."
