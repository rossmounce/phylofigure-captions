Phylogenetic relationships and subgroup designations in R2R3MYB proteins from cucumber (Cs), Arabidopsis (At), grape (Vv), rice (Os), poplar (Pt) and Soybean (Gm).The neighbor-joining tree includes 55 R2R3MYB proteins from cucumber, 126 from Arabidopsis, 117 from Vitis, 102 from rice, 197 from poplar and 244 from soybean. The bootstrap values lower than 50 are not shown in the phylogenetic tree. The proteins are clustered into 90 subgroups (triangles), designated with a subgroup number (e.g. C1). Forty eight proteins did not fit well into subgroups (lines). The membership of each subgroup is described in the table at right. Several subgroups are highlighted. 12 subgroups (yellow) are shared in all the 6 species. 5 subgroups (red) are shared among other 5 speices but not with cucumber. The uncompressed tree with full taxa names is available as Figure S2."
