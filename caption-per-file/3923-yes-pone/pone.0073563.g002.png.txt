The neighbor-joining phylogenetic analysis and modular structures of WAP domain-containing proteins.(A) Unrooted neighbor-joining phylogenetic analysis of the Es-DWD1 (black triangle) amino acid sequences with WAP domain-containing proteins showing high similarity from a BLASTp homology search. The branches of E. sinensis DWD1 sequences are in bold. The tree was produced with MEGA 5.0 software. Three thousand bootstraps were carried out to check the repeatability of the results. Abbreviations: Lv, L. vannamei; Pm, P. monodon; Fc, F. chinensis; Es, E. sinensis; Mj. M. japonicas; Ls. Litopenaeus setiferus; Fb, Farfantepenaeus brasiliensis; Fp, Farfantepenaeus paulensis; Fs, Farfantepenaeus subtilis.(B) The positions of the WAP domain (blue) and other regions (Cys-rich region, Gly-rich region and Proâ€“Arg region; see color key within the figure) are indicted for each type of proteins. All proteins contain a signal peptide (yellow)."
