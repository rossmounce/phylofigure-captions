Phylogenetic Relationship of the Cobalamin Binding Proteins TC, HC, and IF.The phylogenetic tree is constructed from nucleotide search using the NCBI- and UCSC genome browser websites in registered vertebrates. Species are colored recording to the findings of one (predicted to be TC-like) (red), two (TC and IF) (green), or three (TC, IF, and HC) (blue) cobalamin binders in the databases. The accessions numbers for the sequences are listed in the supplementary data (Table S1)."
