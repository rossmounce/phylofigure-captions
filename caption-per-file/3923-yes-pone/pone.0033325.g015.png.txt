Morphological characters mapped on phylogenetic topology of XMAS clade and Prionopelta as an outgroup. Characters plotted on the topology of the XMAS presented in Brady et al. [13]. Numbers in each box correspond to character in Table 1; numbers under the box represent character states; boxes filled in gray indicate those characters are unique to each genus or clade; dashed line is hypothetical."
