Phylogenetic analysis of human parechovirus strains identified in this study based on the partial VP1 region.The reference strains and closest match isolates detected through BLAST are given for genetic comparison. The phylogenetic tree with 1000 bootstrap replicates was reconstructed using neighbor joining method and the K-2P model through MEGA 4.0. Taxa with arrow head indicate the prototype strains within each serotype. Black circles indicate the strains found under this study in Pakistan. HPeV-12 and HPeV-7 previously reported from Pakistan are highlighted."
