Haplotype network and phylogenetic tree resulting from the analysis of the cytb dataset.The haplotype network reconstruction takes into account missing data and gap so the inferred number of haplotype I higher than the one presented in Table 4. Red values on nodes indicate the inferred number of mutation steps between haplotypes or ancestral haplotypes (symbolized by a red node). The absence of value means that the number of steps is inferior to 10. The phylogenetic tree corresponds to the results of a Bayesian inference analysis (see text for details); posterior probabilities (PP) are indicated for major nodes (values below<0.50 are not figured). On the right side, the general origin of Arvicanthis niloticus specimens is figured using circles filled with different colours that directly refer to the map presented in Figure 1."
