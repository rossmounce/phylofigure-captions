Evolution of Fap Systems.Comparison of phylogenetic trees based on the FapA, FapD and FapF protein sequences and corresponding 16S rRNA genes. The phylogenetic trees were estimated using the neighbor-joining method. Full-length 16S rRNA gene sequences could not be obtained for all Fap containing strains due to gaps in genome sequences. The phylogenetic tree is colored according to taxonomy. Betaproteobacteria (blue), Gammaproteobacteria (brown), and Deltaproteobacteria (red). Nonparametric bootstrap values are shown for each node. No bootstrap value represent 100% bootstrap support."
