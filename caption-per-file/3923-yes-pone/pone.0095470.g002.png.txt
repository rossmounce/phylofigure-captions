"pone.0095470.g002.png","Neighbor joining phylogenetic tree based on the N-450 sequences from selected genotype D4 viruses and reference strains.Bootstrap values of at least 70% are shown. The scale bar shows the number of expected substitutions per site. Red dots indicate viruses sequenced in this study that share the indel in the M-F UTR; blue dots indicate viruses sequenced in this study that do not have the indel in the M-F UTR. Black triangles indicated named lineages in MeaNS."
