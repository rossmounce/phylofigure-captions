"pone.0024670.g004.png","Complete chloroplast genome phylogeny of Lemnoideae. The phylogram was drawn by Maximum Parsimony with 1000 replicates of bootstrap test. The tree was rooted by Phoenix dactylifera as an outgroup. Support from bootstrap value was shown at the nodes. The GenBank accessions used for the analyses are JN160603 (S. polyrhiza), DQ400350 (L. minor), JN160604 (W. lingulata), JN160605 (W. australiana) and GU811709 (P. dactylifera). The whole genome sequences were aligned by Multi-LAGAN and MEGA 5 was used to draw the tree."
