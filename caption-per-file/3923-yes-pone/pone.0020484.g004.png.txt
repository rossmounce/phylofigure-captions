Mycoplasma tmRNA stem D1 length mapped on rRNA phylogenetic tree. A) rRNA phylogenetic tree for Mycoplasma for the sequences of tmRNA under study; tmRNA stem D1 values mapped on the rRNA tree; other legend symbols are similar to figure 2A. B) Underlying sequences of the species present in the tree shown in figure 4A; the small letter in the sequences indicate those bases which are mutated in such a way that they are not able to pair any more. The ‘-’ indicates the absence of base."
