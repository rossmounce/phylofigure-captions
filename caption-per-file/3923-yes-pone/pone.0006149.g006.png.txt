"pone.0006149.g006.png","Maximum-likelihood phylogenetic trees, based on the 1,140-nucleotide cytochrome b region of mitochondrial DNA sequences of mammals in the Orders Rodentia and Soricomorpha.The phylogenetic position of the hantavirus-positive Talpa europaea (FJ715340) is shown in relationship to other Talpa europaea cytochrome b sequences from GenBank (AB037601, AB076829), as well as to other members of the Family Talpidae, as well as rodents and shrews. Mustela putorius (EF987746) and Mustela strigidorsa (EF987748) were used for the outgroup. The GenBank number and the country where each animal was captured are provided. Numbers at nodes are posterior node probabilities based on 30,000 trees: two replicate Markov Chain Monte Carlo runs consisting of four chains of two million generations each sampled every 100 generations with a burn-in of 5,000 (25%). The scale bar indicates nucleotide substitutions per site."
