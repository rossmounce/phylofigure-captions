Phylogenetic tree constructed from partial 16S rRNA molecule that contains the highly variable Î³-region.The evolutionary history was inferred using the Neighbor-Joining method [62]. The optimal tree with the sum of branch length = 0.86861675 is shown. The percentages of replicate trees in which the associated taxa clustered together in the bootstrap test (2000 replicates) are shown next to the branches with values higher than 50%. Streptomyces aureofaciens (AY207608) served as an outgroup. The tree is drawn to scale, with branch lengths in the same units as those of the evolutionary distances used to infer the phylogenetic tree. The evolutionary distances were computed using the Jukes-Cantor method [63] and are in the units of the number of base substitutions per site. All positions containing gaps and missing data were eliminated. There were a total of 115 positions in the final dataset. Evolutionary analyses were conducted in MEGA5 [64]. The scale bar represents 0.02 substitutions per nucleotide position. GS, Georgia Strait; IA, Indian Arm; BF, Bamfield; HS, Howe Sound. Streptomyces strains that were chemically analyzed are highlighted in bold and those that may represent new species are underlined. National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) accession numbers are given next to the strain name."
