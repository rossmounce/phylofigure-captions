"pone.0020929.g004.png","A phylogenic tree showing the similarity between Sika deer Ercc6l protein amino acid sequences and those of cattle, panda, dog, horse, fowl, human, monkey, mouse, pongo, rat, xenopus and marmoset. The number at each node indicates the percentage of bootstrapping after 1000 replications. The bar at the bottom indicates 5% amino acid divergence in the sequences. These proteins are highly conserved throughout evolution; high similarity matches exist between Ercc6l sequences across species."
