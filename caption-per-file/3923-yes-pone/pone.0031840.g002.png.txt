Phylogenetic analyses of the combined 13-locus dataset. All topologies are rooted with the Fernwren Oreoscopus gutturalis (not shown for brevity). Support values in form of Bayesian posterior probabilities (BPP) and Maximum Likelihood bootstrap (MLBV) are given above and below each node, respectively, with dark circles and bold font emphasizing strong support (>95% BPP and >80 MLBV). Regular font and open circle halves depict support values below these thresholds. A double dash depicts support values below 50% BPP and 50 MLBV. The concatenated phylogenetic hypothesis in the left panel is based on analyses of the entire dataset under a single, concatenated partition. The center panel represents the topology derived from an analysis of the entire dataset partitioned by locus and codon position for the two mitochondrial protein coding genes. The topology in the right panel illustrates the species tree obtained under the BEST algorithm. Mangrove specialists are highlighted in bold. Geographic range is given alongside taxa of the species tree."
