Phylogeny of genes linked to the MAT locus of C. neoformans.Two of the genes from F. depauperata, STE20 and MYO2, hypothesized to be ancestrally acquired in the pheromone/pheromone receptor locus of the pathogenic Cryptococcus species, clustered with the STE20a and MYO2a alleles of C. gattii and C. neoformans. The remaining genes from F. depauperata exhibit a species-specific phylogeny. Genes from the MATa alleles are shown in green, and genes from the MATα allele are shown in blue. (α) indicates strains with the MATα locus, and (a) indicates strains with the MATa locus. The tree was constructed using Maximum Parsimony, and numbers indicate total changes in the branches. Statistical support was calculated from 1,000 bootstrap replicates. Bootstrap values were >70% in all branches (values not shown). Unrooted trees for Maximum Parsimony and Maximum likelihood are shown in supporting File S1."
