Embedding of the phylogeny of the TIR domain of the adaptor molecules into the phylogeny of the TIR domain of the TLRs for mouse and human shows that early gene duplication gave rise to extant adaptor families and paralleled the diversification of TLRs.Open circles indicate cospeciation events. Closed circles indicate duplication events. Wavy lines indicate failure to diverge and dashed lines indicate loss. Lines with arrows denote ""host"" switching- the co-option of an adaptor by a different TLR. These data are consistent with the vertebrate MyD88 begin recruited from an earlier invertebrate-like MyD88 that was likely associated with TLR9-like TLRs."
