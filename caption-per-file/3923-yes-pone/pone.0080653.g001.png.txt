Phylogeny and diversity of bacterial isolates from marine sponges H. perlevis (HM), P. penicillus (PL) and O. papilla (OP).(A) Maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree of nearly full length 16S rRNA gene sequences (ca. 1400 bp) using Prochlorococcus marinus as an outgroup. Sponge-derived bacterial isolates obtained from this study are highlighted in bold. The closest relatives retrieved through the BLAST search (Table S1) with their GenBank accession numbers are represented. Dashed box delimit the sponge-associated bacterial groups (i.e. the grouping of bacteria retrieved from this study with the previously reported microbes from other sponges). Bootstrap node support values >50% are represented. (B) Stacked histogram showing the relative abundance of 16S rRNA diversity recovered from the sponge sources."
