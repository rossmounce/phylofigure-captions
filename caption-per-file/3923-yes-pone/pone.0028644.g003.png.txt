Selective pressure variation of both TRPA1 and TRPV1 along branches of the tetrapod phylogeny. The tree topology is inferred with ML for each gene. Branch lengths are drawn proportionally to the estimated numbers of nonsynonymous substitutions per codon. The trees are rooted by the frog sequence (not shown). The selective pressures of branches are assigned to dN/dS categories (tick marks along heat scale) by the GA-Branch method implemented in HyPhy. Branches assigned to a given dN/dS category share the same color. Deeper blue indicates a strong purifying selection, whereas hotter colors indicate elevated dN/dS ratios. For branches with letters along them, dN/dS values are re-estimated in PAML and subjected to a positive selection test by LRT."
