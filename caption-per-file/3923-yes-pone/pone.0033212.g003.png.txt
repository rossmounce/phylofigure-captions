Computational analysis of the penton base gene. (A) Bootscan analysis of the HAdV-D59 penton base gene with fully sequenced penton genes in species HAdV-D using a window size of 250 bp and step size of 50 bp. (B) Phylogenetic analysis of the hypervariable loop 1 penton base gene sequences in species HAdV-D. (C) Phylogenetic analysis of the RGD motif and surrounding variable region of sequences in species HAdV-D. The phylogenetic trees were generated from aligned sequences using MEGA, via the neighbor-joining method and a bootstrap test of phylogeny."
