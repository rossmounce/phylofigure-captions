Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of mandible shape, squirrel phylogeny and dietary preferences.(a) Size-corrected PCA of covariance matrix among species means with phylogenetic tree [18] projected onto the shape space defined by the first two principal components. Black mandible outlines along the axes represent shape changes associated with each principal component; grey outlines represent the consensus configuration; (b) Squirrel phylogeny used [18]. Subfamily colours correspond to colour pattern used in the PCA. Colours of terminal points indicate dietary preferences (also used in PCA and CVA, see Fig. 4, Figs. S1â€“S4). Right part of the figure shows morphometric changes along the tree starting from the reconstructed ancestral shape at node 1 and from that of the oldest-known squirrel, Douglassciurus jeffersoni (grey outlines). Black mandible outlines show the reconstructed ancestral shape for each squirrel subfamily (node 2: Sciurinae; node 3: Xerinae; node 4: Callosciurinae)."
