"pone.0055105.g008.png","Phylogenetic relationships between predicted L. hesperus heat shock protein(Hsps) sequences and Hsps from various insect species. Sequences were aligned using MAFFT with default settings. The phylogenetic tree was constructed using the maximum parsimony method implemented in MEGA 5 [72] with default settings. Percentage bootstrap support values above 50%, based on 1000 replicates, are shown. Analyses were performed using only sequences predicted to encode complete ORFs. Non-L. hesperus sequences are indicted by accession numbers with the respective genus and species shown in parentheses. L. hesperus sequences are indicated by the corresponding isogroup identifier. Sequence-confirmed L. hesperus Hsps are shown in bold with the respective accession number in parentheses. Sequences clustered into the six major Hsp protein families (brackets). Asterisk (*) indicates isogroups generated from multiple identical isotig sequences: isogroup00528 = 9 isotigs, isogroup00422 = 9 isotigs, isogroup01416 = 2 isotigs, isogroup03066 = 2 isotigs, isogroup00127 = 12 isotigs, isogroup00701 = 5 isotigs, isogroup01249 = 4 isotigs, and isogroup02441 = 2 isotigs."
