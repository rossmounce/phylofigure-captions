HPV33 variant tree topologies and pairwise comparisons of individual complete genomes. The phylogenetic tree was constructed as described in Figure 2. Distinct variant lineages (i.e., termed A and B) are classified according to the topology and nucleotide sequence differences from >1% to 0.5% to Figure 2."
