"pone.0080272.g006.png","Small scale validation of the chromosome 1AS physical map using information from the previously published Pm3 powdery mildew resistance locus.Two assembled physical contigs (ltc132 and ltc5245) were linked together using a previously published 178 kb sequence from chromosome 1AS (cv. Chinese Spring) covering the the Pm3 locus (Wicker et al. 2007). Approximate locations of NimbleGen transcriptome hybridisation probes are shown in blue. The Pm3 and the low molecular weight (LMW) glutenin loci are known to be closely linked (Wicker et al. 2003; Wang et al. 2010). The inset shows a phylogenetic analysis that compares glutenin UniGene sequences with previously published glutenin genes from 1AS (TmGluA3, green), 1BS (TaGluB) and 1DS (TaGluD)."
