"pone.0084781.g003.png","Conserved motif analysis of Brachypodium MADS-box proteins according to the phylogenetic relationship.Each motif is represented by a number in a colored box. Motif 1 is the MADS-box domain; 2 and 3 are two different components of the K domain; 4 and 20 are I domains; 6 is a 129 amino acid MADS-box domain; 8 is a structure; 5, 7 and 9?19 are unidentified regions. Box length corresponds to motif length. Specific lengths, locations and p-values of each motif can be found in Table S4 in File S1."
