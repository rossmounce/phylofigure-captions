"pone.0028119.g004.png","MARK1, 2 and 3 inhibit TRESK, BRSK1 is a possible regulator, whereas the other tested AMPK-related kinases do not influence the recovery of the K+ current. A. Multiple alignment and phylogenetic tree of mouse full-length AMPK-related kinases was created with Clustal W2 and TreeView. The enzymes, which have been cloned and functionally tested on TRESK, are shown in colors different from gray. The MARK kinases, which efficiently inhibit TRESK, are indicated with an orange ellipse. B. Time-dependent recovery of background K+ currents after the ionomycin stimulation (Iono., 0.5 µM, as indicated by the horizontal black bar) is shown for the groups of oocytes coexpressing the different AMPK-related kinases with mouse TRESK. Color code is the same as in panel A. Rapid recovery of K+ current in the MARK1, 2 and 3 groups is indicated with an orange ellipse. C. Average recoveries at the end of the measurement are shown for the different groups. The number in the columns indicates the sample size. SIK1 construct (SIK1#) contained amino acids 1–343, which included the kinase domain. The recovery in the MARK1, 2 and 3 groups was significantly different from that of the control cells (one-way ANOVA, followed by Tukey HSD test, *pD. Oocytes coexpressing BRSK1 and mouse TRESK (BRSK1, ferruginous curve, n = 16) or expressing only the channel (control, black curve, n = 15) were stimulated with ionomycin as in the case of the other AMPK-related kinases in panels A, B and C. Note that ionomycin did not activate TRESK current in the cells, which coexpressed BRSK1 with the channel. E. Representative photograph of a control oocyte expressing TRESK channels. Appearance is not different from a non-injected cell (not shown). F. Representative photograph of an oocyte coexpressing TRESK with MARK2 kinase. Note the reduced pigmentation on the animal pole, and the peculiar dark dots on the vegetative hemisphere following a more or less hexagonal arrangement."
