Chimeric structure of the two GalileoN copies (GalileoN-4 and GalileoN-5) observed at the breakpoints of inversion 2z3.GalileoN-1 and GalileoN-2 were found in a previous study [60]. Top: Nucleotides present in the four GalileoN copies at 53 variable sites are shown. Bottom: Neighbor-joining phylogenetic trees of the GalileoN sequences built separately for the two portions of the sequence: sites 1–824 (left) and sites 966–1567 (right)."
