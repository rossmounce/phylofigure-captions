"pone.0021504.g003.png","Phylogenetic relationships of FGF receptor genes. D. melanogaster has two FGF receptors, Htl and Btl. A Neighbor-Joining tree of Htl and Btl proteins among mosquito and Drosophila species is shown. The gene ID and the species name (5 letters) are indicated for the orthologs. The optimal tree (the sum of branch length = 2.022) is shown. The percentage values of replicate trees in which the associated taxa clustered together in the bootstrap test (1000 replicates) are shown next to the branches. The tree is drawn to scale (shown below the tree), with branch lengths in the same units as those of the evolutionary distances used to infer the phylogeny. The distance scale is in units of the number of amino acid substitutions per site. The results of these analyses indicate that mosquito FGF receptors are htl orthologs, and mosquitoes lack btl."
