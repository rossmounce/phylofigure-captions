"pone.0088837.g001.png","Phylogeny of Prochlorococcus and marine Synechococcus with genome sizes and protein-coding gene counts.The phylogenetic relationship of 12 Prochlorococcus and 5 marine Synechococcus is reconstructed from concatenation of 100 conserved protein alignments using a maximum likelihood analysis with Tree-PUZZLE implemented in PHYLIP 3.6a. The branch length is defined as the expected number of amino acid substitutions per site. Support for the internal branches of the quartet puzzling tree topology is shown as a percentage. Genome size and gene count are reported beside each genome."
