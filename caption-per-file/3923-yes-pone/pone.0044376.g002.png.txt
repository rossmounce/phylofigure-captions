The phylogenetic tree constructed by the concatenated sequences of SSU and LSU rRNA based on GTR+G model.Numbers indicate the bootstrap scores for ML (left) and Bayesian posterior probabilities for Bayesian (right) that supported the indicated node. Taxon names are color coded according to the taxonomic order designation at NCBI. (A)Animal. Green: chordata, blue: arthropoda, red: nematoda, black: outgroup. (B) Î³-proteobacteria. Green: virionales, blue: enterobacteriales, red: alteromonadales, violet: pseudomonadales, black: outgroup."
