Phylogenetic and structural analysis of WD40 proteins.(A) An amino acid sequence based phylogenetic tree of WD40 proteins from various organisms. The phylogenetic tree was generated by the MEGA 5 software using the neighbour-joining algorithm, and bootstrap values based on 1000 replications are represented at the branch points. The relative amount of change is represented by the scale bar. (B) Deduced amino acid sequence alignment of WD40 repeat proteins from dicot species was generated by ClustalW2. WD40 repeats are shown in boxes. Sequences from other species that extended beyond Linum sequence at the 3`end and did not contain any WD40 domains were trimmed."
