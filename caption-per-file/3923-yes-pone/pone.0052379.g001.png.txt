Multimarker-based phylogenetic analysis of the pathogenic flagellate.(A) A MEGAN tree, based on the output of BLASTX against the NCBI-nr database (E-value <10−3), is shown. Transcripts lacking BLAST matches are assigned to the special node “no hits,” and those not assigned for reasons associated with the algorithm are denoted as “unassigned.” Bacteria are presented to the superkingdom level and Eukaryota are aligned at the kingdom to class level, except for Kinetoplastida, where the highest matching at the subclass level is shown. (B) Phylogenetic tree constructed upon a concatenation of three conserved proteins (α-tubulin, heat shock protein 70 and heat shock protein 90) consisting of 1,184 amino acids using the BEAST software. Elongation factor-1 (EF-1) was excluded due to its partial nature. The distance scale is given under the tree. (C) List of putative proteins with regions conserved across species. The respective sequencing reads have been deposited in GenBank (Accession numbers JU062373 through JU062376)."
