"pone.0023122.g002.png","The maximum-likelihood (ML) estimate of Ant phylogeny supports an ancient origin of Ant4. (A) Large scale phylogeny of animal Ant homologs obtained by ML analysis of amino acid sequences using the LG+Γ+F model of evolution. Support based upon 500 bootstrap replicates is shown as a percentage adjacent to the relevant branches when it exceeds 50%. This phylogeny included a fungal (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) outgroup, and the root of the tree was assumed to lie between fungi and the animal-choanoflagellate clade (the latter group is represented by Monosiga brevicollis). This phylogeny suggests a number of ancient gene duplications, one of which led to a “core group” that includes the vertebrate Ant homologs. (B) Phylogeney of the “core group” obtained using the same model. Support based upon 500 bootstrap replicates is shown as a percentage adjacent to the relevant branches when it exceeds 50%; support for some clades within well-supported groups (e.g. branches within teleost fish) was omitted in the interest of simplicity. Analyses using this more limited taxon sample were conducted to test the possibility that the position of Ant4 was influenced by the inclusion of divergent sequences. The position of Ant4 was robust to the taxon set analyzed; in fact, the bootstrap support for an ancient origin (the Ant4-tunicate clade) increased for the smaller taxon sample."
