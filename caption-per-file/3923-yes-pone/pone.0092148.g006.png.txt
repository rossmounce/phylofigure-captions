"pone.0092148.g006.png","Molecular clock estimates for the evolution of the Globigerinella siphonifera lineages.Molecular phylogeny of G. siphonifera and Beella digitata based on a MAFFT alignment with time estimate ranges from the uncorrelated lognormal (blue) and exponential (red) molecular clocks. Numbers at nodes indicate the divergence ages shown with their 95% confidence intervals. Number in brackets indicates fixed age for the split of G. siphonifera and B. digitata. Green triangles and numbers show ages calculated in de Vargas et al.[23], except for one terminal node which seems too young. Black arrow indicates the starting point from where the presence of a certain trait had a significant effect on the speciation rate, based on a covariates generalized linear model approach."
