Phylogenetic analysis of APEHSs and APEH-3Ss proteins in the archaeal kingdom.The cladogram shown in A (APEHSs) includes 43 archaeal organisms, while in the tree shown in B (APEH-3Ss) only 15 species were retrieved, all belonging to Crenarchaeota phylum. The organisms in both trees are color coded according to the NCBI taxonomy. The trees were constructed by running Blast Explorer [41], in order to identify public similar sequences. For each run, proteins corresponding to hits pertaining to the Archaea, with BLAST e-value lower than 1E-20 and covering at least 50% of query sequence, were selected and fed to the “One Click Mode Phylogeny analysis” pipeline available on www.phylogeny.fr."
