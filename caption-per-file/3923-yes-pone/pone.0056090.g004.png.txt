Bayesian tree depicting phylogenetic relationships of putative drug exporting RND superfamily transporters identified within the genomes of sequenced Acinetobacter spp.(as determined using TransAAP). Also included are previously characterized transporters classified within the Hydrophobe/Amphiphile Efflux-1 family of the RND superfamily, as listed in the Transporter Classification Database (www.tcdb.org). The protein sequence of the A. baumannii ATCC 17978 RND efflux transporter from the Heavy Metal Efflux family, CzcA (A1S_2932), was used as an out-group. Branch lengths are proportional to phylogenetic distance and the confidence of each node is indicated by posterior probabilities. Proteins othologous to the major RND drug efflux systems encoded in Acinetobacter, AdeB, AdeJ and AdeG are indicated. Gray shaded boxes denote clades that include orthologs from both A. baumannii and A. baylyi."
