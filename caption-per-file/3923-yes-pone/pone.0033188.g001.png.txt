"pone.0033188.g001.png","Phylogenetic tree of LAB in bee crops. Phylogenetic tree based on a distance matrix of positions 56–1470 (Escherichia coli numbering) in the 16S rRNA gene of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium spp. bacteria from Apis species (red) and the stingless bees Melipona beechii (turquoise), Meliponula bocandeii (green) and Trigona sp (blue). Previously characterized bacterial phylotypes from Apis mellifera are in bold print (red). Bacterial type strains are in bold characters (black). Phylotypes in the framework (right) represent different clusters belonging to a characterised or possibly novel species. Bifidobacterium group is the out-group. Bar: 5 base pair changes. 16S rRNA gene sequences deposited in GenBank HM534742–HM534842 (in parenthesis)."
