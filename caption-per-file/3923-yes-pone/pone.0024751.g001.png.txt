"pone.0024751.g001.png","Identification and analysis of B7-H3 isoforms in different species. (A)phylogenetic analysis of the B7-H3 gene in vertebrates. The tree was constructed from CLUSTAL generated amino acid alignments using the neighbor-joining method. Tree topography was evaluated by bootstrapping 500 times with percentages shown at nodes. The species with duplication event were underlined and the species with only 2IgB7-H3 were labeling with VC after the name. (B) PCR analysis of different RNA samples using B7-H3-specific primer. A product of about 1200 bp corresponds to a 4IgB7-H3 molecule, whereas a 500 bp would represent the 2IgB7-H3 gene. (C) Sequence alignment of deduced translated cow, guinea pig, macaque and dog B7-H3 products. Dark bars or dotted lines above sequence alignment denote exon domains demarcated by genomic sequences."
