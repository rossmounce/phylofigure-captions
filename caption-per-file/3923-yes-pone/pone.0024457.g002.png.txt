The taxonomic sampling of Alphaproteobacteria is enhanced by the addition of GOS sequences. A phylogenetic analysis of 1641 GOS RPS2 homologs reveals that the taxonomic sampling is increased for most major bacterial clades, and specifically for the Alphaproteobacteria. The vast majority (82.5%) of the extracted RPS2 homologs that are placed in the Alphaproteobacteria is associated with the SAR11 clade, which includes Ca. Pelagibacter ubique. Rhodobacterales, Rhodospirillales, Rhizobiales and Rickettsiales are associated with 9.3, 7.4, 0.6 and 0.2% of the GOS sequences, respectively. The sequence data covered by the GOS dataset greatly increases the previous sampling of the SAR11-clade, as well as of other oceanic bacteria that lack sequenced representatives, thereby representing a rich source of sequences useful for examining the placement of mitochondria in relation to bacteria adapted to the upper surface waters of the oceans. For clarity, all GOS clades have been collapsed. Annotation of collapsed GOS clades is as follows: l and n represent the total branch length and the number of GOS sequences within collapsed GOS clades, respectively, and shading is according to the total branch length of the clade as indicated."
