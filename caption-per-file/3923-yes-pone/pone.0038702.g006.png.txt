Bayesian phylogram of the analysis of all accessions of sections Virgata and Urvilleana, using only the B genome of knotted1; topology is that presented in Supplemental Figure S1 for the Virgata-Urvilleana clade, but with sequence names replaced by colored ovals.The pink oval with the letter c indicates sequences from P. virgatum var. cubense. Unlabeled ovals represent sequences from tetraploids. Ovals labeled with 6x or 8x indicate hexaploid or octoploid plants, respectively, from which only one sequence type was recovered. Slender lines connect sequences from the same plant. Vertices labeled 6x or 8x indicate hexaploid or octoploid plants respectively; unlabeled vertices indicate tetraploids. Numbers above branches are Bayesian posterior probabilities."
