Neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree of plasma and gut-derived nef quasispecies.234 full-length nef sequences were aligned with consensus B and NL4-3. A neighbor-joining tree was constructed, rooted on consensus B, and evaluated with 1000 bootstrap replicates. Clusters of sequences from each subject all had 100% bootstrap support and other significant bootstrap values >70% within each subject cluster are indicated on the tree. Sequences from plasma are indicated with grey triangles; gut, black circles. Filled circles are sequences from biopsy #1 and open circles, from biopsy #2."
