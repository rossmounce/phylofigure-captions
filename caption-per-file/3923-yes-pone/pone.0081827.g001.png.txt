"pone.0081827.g001.png","Bayesian molecular phylogeny of nerve growth factors (NGF).Branches with the Bayesian posterior probability (B.P.P) of less than 0.85 are highlighted in grey (remaining in colours). Site model 8 (M8) computed ω values for respective lineages are presented. The number of positively selected sites (PP ≥ 0.95) detected by M8’s Bayes-Empirical Bayes (BEB) approach in Elapidae lineage is also indicated. Elapid sequences representing putative duplicate genes are indicated with red labels [NFF: “non-front-fanged” advanced snakes; SCI: Scinciformata]."
