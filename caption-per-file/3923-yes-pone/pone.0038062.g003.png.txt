"pone.0038062.g003.png","Bacterial phylogenies generated from MLST marker sequence alignments.A–D, F: Bacterial ML phylogenies generated from hypervariability filtered ftsY (A), gidA (B), rpsA (C), and sucB (D) gene sequences or a concatenation of these (F). Terminal branches are labelled by genus and species, pathotype and/or strain designations, GenBank accession numbers, and pairwise nucleotide sequence identity percentages respect to the ‘Rickettsiella ixodidis’ GSU sequence as calculated from a p-distance matrix with. Numbers on internal branches indicate bootstrap support values; branches that do not receive >90% bootstrap support are represented by dashed lines. Trees were rooted using Escherichia coli as outgroup. The size bar corresponds to 5% sequence divergence. E: Extended majority rule consensus tree topology generated from 24 phylogenies reconstructed by the ML, ME, or NJ method from hypervariability filtered nucleotide or deduced amino acid sequence alignments of the ftsY, gidA, rpsA, or sucB marker. For compatibility with the other markers, specimens ‘R. agriotidis’, ‘R. pyronotae’ and ‘Diplorickettsia massiliensis’ were removed from the ftsY data sets prior to single phylogeny reconstruction. Terminal branches are labelled by genus and species, pathotype and/or strain designations. Internal branches collapsing under the strict consensus criterion are represented by dashed lines; the frequency of occurrence across the aggregated set of phylogenies is indicated as a percentage value on top of the respective branch."
