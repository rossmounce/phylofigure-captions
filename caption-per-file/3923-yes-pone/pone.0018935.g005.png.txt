"pone.0018935.g005.png","TFIIB (transcription factor II B) phylogenetic tree (82 sequences, 97 positions) constructed using a Bayesian approach. Bayesian posterior probabilities are mentioned near branches and are used as confidence values of tree branches. A color code was used to represent taxonomic groups, Archaea in green, Eukarya in blue, NCLDVs in red, and environmental sequences in black. For details on evolutionary models and phylogenetic methods, see Materials and Methods."
