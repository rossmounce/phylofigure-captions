"pone.0054275.g017.png","Strict consensus of 194 most parsimonious cladograms of 679 steps, showing the phylogenetic relationships of Maledictosuchus riclaensis gen. et sp. nov. within Metriorhynchidae with forty ordered characters (see methods section for complete list of ordered characters).Ensemble consistency index, CI = 0.473; ensemble retention index, RI = 0.860; rescaled consistency index, RC = 0.407. Numbers over lines represent Bremer support values. Numbers under lines represent bootstrap values (only values over 50% represented). Ordering forty multistate characters (see methods) resulted in a loss of resolution among non-metriorhynchids, but significantly improved the resolution within Rhacheosaurini. Maledictosuchus riclaensis gen. et sp. nov. is recovered as the basal-most member of this tribe."
