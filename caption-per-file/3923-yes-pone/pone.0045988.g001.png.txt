Sequence analyses of the full-length cDNA corresponding to CvPrx.(A) The phylogenetic tree was constructed with the full-length deduced amino acid sequences of Prx genes from Arabidopsis and Chlorella using the Clustal W program with bootstrapping, and was made visible with the TreeView program. Bar, 0.1 amino acid substitutions per site. (B) The amino acid sequence deduced from CvPrx was compared with the sequences deduced from Arabidopsis Prx cDNAs. The arrows indicate two conserved cysteine residues found in 2-Cys Prx. The asterisks indicate the N-terminal sequence of predicted Chlorella Prx described previously [13]."
