Schematic drawing of the evolution of the clusters of MXEs within eumetazoan Mhc genes.The only Ctenophora sequenced, Mnemiopsis leidyi, contains a cluster of MXEs that does not correspond to any other known cluster and has therefore been named cluster-0. The tree is shown as schematic tree representing known phylogenetic relationships to which MXE cluster loss and gain events were plotted. MXE clusters were regarded as gained in the last common ancestor of the branch, which contains species encoding these clusters. According to this scheme, five clusters have evolved in the last common ancestor of the Protostomia, and a set of three clusters later at the onset of the arthropods. There are many branches and species that completely lost all clusters of MXEs in their Mhc genes. Coloured boxes represent MXE cluster gain events (tree view, left side) and their presence within a certain branch (table, right side). Crossed boxes denote MXE cluster loss events. MXEs in light-colour symbolize clusters of MXEs that were supposed to be present but could not be approved because of genome assembly gaps (Figure S2)."
