"pone.0024344.g001.png","Maximum-likelihood phylogeny reconstructed using the D1â€“D5 region of the 28S rRNA gene. The DNA substitution model parameters estimated by RAxML were; f(A) 0.24, f(C) 0.24, f(G) 0.33, f(T) 0.19; R(AC) 0.53, R(AG) 1.73, R(AAT) 1.0, R(CG) 0.52, R(CT) 5.71, R(GT) 1.0; alpha 0.52; pinvar 0.43. Sequences produced during this study are in bold. Sampling locations for each taxon are given in Table S1. Other sequences were downloaded from Genbank (A. queenslandica, EF654518, Haplosclerina sp., AY561860). Taxon labels showing an * are those comprised of sequences from two specimens, in each case the D3 sequence was downloaded from Genbank (C. multiformis, AF441344 C. plicifera, AF441345; H. toxius, AF441342; H. vansoesti, AF441346; N. olemda, AF441353 and H. xena, AY319327). Numbers on the branches represent bootstrap proportions/posterior probabilities."
