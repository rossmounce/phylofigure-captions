"pone.0088090.g001.png","Phylogenetic analysis of M. tuberculosis PpiA and PpiB.Fig. 1A: The phylogram of mycobacterial cyclophilins revealed two distinct clades of PpiA and PpiB. Fig. 1B: M. tuberculosis PpiA (MTBPPIA) aligned with human cyclophilins (initials ?HPP?) instead of clustering with other mycobacterial cyclophilins (initial ?M?). In both Fig. 1A and B, M. tuberculosis PpiA and PpiB are labeled red and green, respectively."
