"pone.0035947.g002.png","Molecular phylogenetic analysis of selected AcuI polypeptides.Strains, clades, and protein identification numbers of a selection of the AcuI polypeptides in are shown. Strains in which MDR012-type polypeptides are encoded by acuI genes that are close to dmdA or to the various ddd genes are highlighted in yellow and the two MDR028 gene products near dddQ in green. Those cases where the cloned acuI genes were shown experimentally to correct the acrylate sensitivity of the E. coli YhdH− mutant are underlined. Other examples illustrate the wide taxonomic range of bacteria that harbour AcuI homologues, several of which are closely related to those encoded by genes linked to ddd or dmdA, and include some genera (Xanthomonas, Streptomyces, Geobacter) in which only some strains contain AcuI homologues. (C./V. = Chlamydiae/Verrucomicrobia; α-, β-, δ-, γ-, ε- refer to the corresponding sub-phylum of Proteobacteria). Three strains have two separate AcuI homologues, as indicated for Dechloromonas aromatica, Alkalilimnicola ehrlichii and Psychrobacter cryohalolentis. The tree with the highest log likelihoood is shown. The percentage of trees in which the associated taxa clustered together is shown next to the branches. Initial tree(s) for the heuristic search were obtained automatically using maximum parsimony method or by the BIONJ method with MCL distance matrix. The tree is drawn to scale, with branch lengths measured in the number of substitutions per site."
