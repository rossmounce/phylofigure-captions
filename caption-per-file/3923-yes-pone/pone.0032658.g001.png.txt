"pone.0032658.g001.png","Evolutionary relationship among ERD4 homologs. Evolutionary relationship was inferred using the Neighbor-Joining method in MEGA4 software. The percentage of replicate trees in which the associated taxa clustered together in the bootstrap test (100 replicates) is shown next to the branches. The tree is drawn to scale with branch lengths in the same units as those of the evolutionary distances used to infer the phylogenetic tree. The evolutionary distances are in the units of the number of amino acid substitutions per site. Also shown in brackets are the pair-wise percentage identity between B. juncea ERD4 and other plant proteins, including green algae."
