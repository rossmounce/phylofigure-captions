"pone.0028525.g004.png","Phylogram of the phosphatidylethanolamine binding protein (PEBP) family of selected arthropods. The bootstrapped phylogram (1,000 iterations) was obtained from the alignment of deducted Amblyomma maculatum proteins with homologs found in the non-redundant protein database of the NCBI. The Am. maculatum protein names start with Am- and the remaining proteins are named by the first three letters of the genus name followed by the first three letters of the species name followed by their NCBI gi| accession number. The number at the nodes indicates the bootstrap support, and the bar at the bottom indicates 10% amino acid divergence. Two tick clades are indicated by Roman numerals."
