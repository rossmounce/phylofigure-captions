"pone.0017293.g004.png","Phylogenetic trees are reconstructed by using the maximum likelihood (ML) alignment method with Jukes-Cantor model, the neighbor-joining (NJ) method with the Kimura 2 parameter model and with the Jukes-Cantor model. It is clear that swine flu viruses are not clustered correctly using the ML method (figure 4(a)). The NJ method with the Kimura and Jukes-Cantor models yields totally different phylogenetic trees. The Kimura model fails to distinguish the origin of A H1N1 virus since A H1N1 genomes are all very far away from other genomes (figure 4(b)), while the Jukes-Cantor model fails to cluster swine flu viruses correctly(figure 4(c)). The data is described in Supporting Information S1."
