"pone.0004859.g002.png","Phylogenetic position of Rungwecebus in relation to Papio and other members of the Papionini - mitochondrial DNA phylogeny.The phylogram is based on the neighbor-joining algorithm and by applying the TrN+I+G model of sequence evolution. Marked * nodes yielded bootstrap values of ≥85% (for MP, NJ and ML) or posterior probability values of ≥0.95 (Bayesian). Red = P. papio, green = P. anubis, grey = P. hamadryas, yellow = P. cynocephalus, brown = P. ursinus. Bars on the right side of the phylogram denote respective baboon clades and are discussed in the text."
