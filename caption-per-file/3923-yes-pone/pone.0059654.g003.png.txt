Neighbor-Joining phylogenetic trees of the haplotypes of the diamondback moth from China based on the combined genes of cox1, atp8, atp6 and nad5 (A), and globally based on the cox1 gene (B).When the haplotype was unique to one individual, the population name with a number was used as the haplotype name; When the haplotype was unique to individuals from the same population, the population name with a letter was used as the haplotype name; When the haplotype was shared by different populations from China, the ?Hap? with a number was used as the haplotype name; When the haplotype was found in other countries, the country name was added/used in the haplotype name."
