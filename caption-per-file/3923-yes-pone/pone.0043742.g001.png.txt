"pone.0043742.g001.png","Full-genome pH1N1 phylogenetic analysis of Reunion Island viruses.a. Full-genome derived phylogenetic tree of concatenated sequences from 15 Reunion Island viruses and 101 representative sequences of the 7 world clades. Bayesian analyses were used to fix tree topologies. Branches are colored by global clade, as defined by Nelson et al. [5]. Phylogenetic clusters containing Reunion Island and Australian sequences are outlined. b. Enlarged representation of Clade RUN. “H” indicates viral sequences derived from the same Household. Throughout, Posterior Probabilities are represented in bold (PP>0.95), and where nodes coincided Maximum Likelihood bootstrap values are represented in italic (MLbp>70). Scale bar indicates the number of nucleotide substitution per site."
