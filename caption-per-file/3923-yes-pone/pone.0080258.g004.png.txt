"pone.0080258.g004.png","Distribution of the REP modules analyzed in this study in the Paracoccus spp. genomes.A specific DNA probe (fragment of a rep gene amplified by PCR and DIG-labeled) was prepared for each analyzed REP module and used in dot blot hybridization analysis with total DNA isolated from 20 strains of Paracoccus spp. The results are presented as a matrix. The relatedness of the tested Paracoccus strains is shown beneath by a phylogenetic tree based on their 16S rDNA sequences. The tree was constructed by the neighbor-joining algorithm with Kimura corrected distances. The statistical support for the internal nodes was determined by 1000 bootstrap replicates and values of >50% are shown. The Paracoccus strains from which the plasmids were isolated are denoted by red text."
