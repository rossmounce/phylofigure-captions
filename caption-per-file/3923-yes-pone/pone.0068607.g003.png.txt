Phylogenetic analyses of aqua- and orthoreovirus structural proteins.(A) Maximum-likelihood (PhyML 3.0) unrooted phylogram of concatenated aqua- and orthoreovirus core proteins (core RdRp, core NTPase, and core turret). Homologous proteins from representative members of other genera in subfamily Spinareovirinae were included as outgroups. Program-estimated values for invariant proportion and gamma shape parameter were 0.011 and 1.781, respectively. Branches with support values ?90% are not labeled, and those with support values <50% are collapsed into polytomies. (B) Maximum-likelihood (PhyML 3.0) phylogram of concatenated aqua- and orthoreovirus outer-capsid proteins (outer shell [T?=?13] and outer clamp). Program-estimated values for invariant proportion and gamma shape parameter were 0.011 and 1.539, respectively. Branches with support values ?90% are not labeled, and those with support values <50% are collapsed into polytomies. Symbols near virus names highlight fish viruses, FAST-protein-encoding fusogenic viruses (circular clusters representing multinucleated syncytia), and fiber-protein-encoding viruses (lollipops). Darker gray shading encompasses approved species in each genus; lighter gray shading extends to encompass tentative species in each genus. The boundary between 11- and 10-segmented viruses is indicated. Darker arrowheads suggest putative points of FAST protein gain during evolution; lighter arrowheads suggest putative points of fiber protein loss during evolution. Scale bars indicate the number of substitutions per aligned aa position giving rise to the phylogram."
