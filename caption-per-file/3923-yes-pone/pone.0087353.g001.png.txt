Phylogenomic tree based on a concatenated alignment of up to 83 genes illustrating the phylogenetic position of the candidate phylum Poribacteria.Bootstrap value (100 resamplings) are shown on tree nodes where support â‰¥50%. Number of genomes per group is displayed in group boxes. Outgroup consists of several species of Spirochaetes and Gammaproteobacteria. The scale bar represents 10% sequence divergence."
