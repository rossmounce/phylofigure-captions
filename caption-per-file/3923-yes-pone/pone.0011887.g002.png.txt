Congruent Bayesian/ML phylogenetic tree showing the placement of Strepsiptera in Coleoptera and interrelationships of other holometabolous insects based on the combined analysis of DNA sequence data from 9 genes.Bayesian PP's ≥0.50 and ML BS values ≥50% are shown above branches (BPP/BS). Note the relatively long branches subtending Diptera and Strepsiptera (see inset), consistent with previous studies [e.g., 28,29,40]. Images of insect exemplars are not to scale. Images of Raphidioptera and Megaloptera copyright Ainsley Seago, other insect images copyright Australian Museum. * Halictophagidae/Myrmecolacidae"
