Phylogenomic analysis of V. inaequalis.Maximum Likelihood based phylogenetic analysis using RAxML tool, on three different super-alignments of V. inaequalis and that of other nine selected fungal pathogens, were used to establish phylogenomic relationship. A, B, C represents phylogenetic tree from super-alignment constructed by Gblocks-con, Gblocks-lib and remgaps, respectively using Hal pipeline."
