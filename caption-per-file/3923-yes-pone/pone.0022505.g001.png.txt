A reconstruction of the phylogenetic relationship of the 35 concatenated COX1 and NADH1 haplotype sequences from Schistocephalus collected from two different stickleback hosts and across three geographic regions. The tree is rooted using Spirometra erinaceieuropaei sequence as an outgroup, which is the closest cestode relative for which there was sufficient mtDNA sequence. The tree was reconstructed using Parsimony, Maximum Likelihood, and Bayesian approaches, and all gave qualitatively similar results (Maximum Likelihood topology is shown). In particular, the deepest division is between sequences from P. pungitius hosts (top) and G. aculeatus host (bottom), with these sequences being different, on average, at nearly 20% of the sites in the sequence (substitution rate above branch). This division is highly supported regardless of being measured by Bayesian Posterior Probability, Bootstrap, or Likelihood Ratio (support below branch). The next supported division is between Schistocephalus from Wales as compared to Oregon and Alaska, but with a sequence divergence less than 5%. The final strongly supported division are Schistocephalus from Oregon as compared to Alaska, but with a sequence divergence of less than 1%. Black dots represented Schistocephalus samples collected from either threespine or ninespine hosts from within Mud Lake, Alaska."
