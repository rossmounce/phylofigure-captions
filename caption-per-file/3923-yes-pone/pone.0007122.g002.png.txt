"pone.0007122.g002.png","Maximum likelihood phylogenetic analyses of HIV-1 sequences corresponding to the C2-V5 region of env. Phylograms of blood and genital tract RNA and DNA sequences, derived by single-genome-amplification, are shown. Mixing of genital tract and blood sequences was noted in phylograms of most subjects. Subjects 5 and 6 were studied during “failing” (>400 copies/mL) ART. Subjects 7 and 8 were studied while not receiving ART. HIV-1 sequences from plasma (gray stars); PBMC (gray circles), cell-free cervical RNA (black stars) and cell-associated cervical DNA (black circles) are shown. Bootstrap values of >70% are indicated in each tree. Phylograms were rooted using representative sequences, indicated with the letter B, for the corresponding subtype from GenBank (Clade B: B.US.83.RF, B.US.90.WEAU160, B.FR.83.HXB2, B.US.86.JRFL). The scale bar (horizontal line) indicates the horizontal branch length corresponding to 1 substitution per 100 sites."
