"pone.0011168.g001.png","Genomic organization, phylogeny, and expression of the An. gambiae OXR1 gene.(A) Genomic organization of AgOXR1 gene and splice forms transcript B, C, and I. (B) Phylogenetic tree based on the sequence alignment of the deduced amino acid sequence of members of the OXR1 family from different species. (Hs  =  Homo sapiens, Mm =  Mus musculus, Dm  =  Drosophila melanogaster, Ae  =  Aedes aegypti, Ag  =  Anopheles gambiae, At  =  Arabidopsis thaliana and Sc  =  Saccharomyces cerevisiae). The sequence alignment used to build the dendrogram is shown in Figure S1. (C) Changes in Catalase, Glutathione peroxidase, JNK and OXR1 (TLDc domain region) mRNA levels 6 h after H2O2 injection (T) compared with water-injected control mosquitoes (C) in A. gambiae. Values were normalized using An. gambiae ribosomal protein S7 mRNA levels as an internal reference. Mean ± SEM. (D) Changes in mRNAs levels of specific OXR-1 isoforms (OXR1-C, OXR1-I and OXR1-E18) and of all OXR1 transcripts (OXR1-all, in which primers from the shared TLDc domain were used) were determined 6 h after injection of H2O2 (T  =  treated group) or water control (C  =  control group) in An. gambiae (G3 strain). Values were normalized using An. gambiae ribosomal protein S7 mRNA levels as an internal reference. Mean ± SEM. * indicates significant differences (p"
