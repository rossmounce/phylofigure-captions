"pone.0068867.g001.png","Species topologies of bats showing information on bat phylogeny, gene pseudogenization and echolocation call type.(A) The species topology of 35 bats. Branches leading to rhinolophids, vespertilionid bats, Miniopterus fuliginosus and Desmodus rotundus which were tested by branch model tests and TestBranchDNDS tests are colored with red, purple, yellow and blue, respectively. (B) The species topology of 18 bats. Branches leading to rhinolophids, Pteronotus and Pipistrellus abramus which were tested by branch model tests and TestBranchDNDS tests are colored with red, blue and yellow, respectively. Both species topologies are based on accepted bat species relationships (see Materials and Methods for references)."
