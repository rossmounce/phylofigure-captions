Maximum parsimony phylogeny of 35 MST genotypes for Coxiella burnetii. This phylogenetic tree has a homoplasy index of 0.0909 and was drawn as described in the methods and results using the 112 polymorphisms listed in Table S1. The 34 MST genotypes and their positions on the phylogeny are given along with a novel MST genotype derived from in silico analysis of the whole genome sequence Dugway 5J108â€“111. The remaining six whole genome sequences are shown in blue text alongside their corresponding MST genotype as determined by in silico analysis, however analyses of MSU Goat and African Q revealed alleles at only 9 of 10 loci, therefore they are assigned to their most likely MST genotype. Our alignments showed no differences between MST genotypes 14 and 15. Stars indicate the 14 branches that were targeted for assay development. Our predicted genomic groups based on Hendrix et al. [10] are highlighted along with the total number of samples (n) from our study that genotyped into these groups."
