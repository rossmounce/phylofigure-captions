"pone.0092233.g002.png","Time-calibrated intraspecific phylogeny of Plestiodon latiscutatus.Colors refer to separate islands and to island colors used in Fig. 1. Numbers after sample names indicate the number of sampled individuals that share that haplotype. Values above or below the nodes indicate Bayesian posterior probabilities calculated from 8000 trees in the posterior distribution. Grey bars indicate the 95% credible set of ages. Pie charts indicate the relative probability that the ancestral population of a clade inhabited specific Izu Islands indicated by each color."
