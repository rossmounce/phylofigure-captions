"pone.0051315.g001.png","Alignment and phylogenetic tree of CENH3s.(A) Amino acid sequence alignment of CENH3s of A. fistulosum (AfiCENH3), A. cepa (AceCENH3), A. sativum (AsaCENH3), A. tuberosum (AtuCENH3) and Oryza sativa (OsCENH3), and a canonical histone H3 of O. sativa (OsHistoneH3). Identical, similar and weakly similar amino acids are indicated by asterisks, colons and dots, respectively. A red box indicates the amino acid residues used for the generation of antibody against AfiCENH3. Blue boxes correspond to helices in a histone fold domain. (B) Phylogenetic tree based on CENH3 amino acid sequences of plant species. A canonical histone H3 from O. sativa was used as an outgroup. Bootstrap values in 1000 tests are indicated on the branches."
