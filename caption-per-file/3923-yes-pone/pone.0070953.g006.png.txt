Sandelia lineage diversity.(a) Eight lineages with strong geographic affinities recovered with Maximum Likelihood phylogenetic analysis of mitochondrial cyt b haplotypes (1?30) identified in Sandelia from the south-western CFR. Bayesian posterior probabilities are given on the branches. The colours denote lineages and their distribution ranges are presented in Figure S3 in Appendix S2. (b) TCS network of cyt b haplotypes (1?30) from individuals of Sandelia from the south-western CFR. The sizes of circles are proportional to haplotype frequency, and the colours indicate the river system (s) where the haplotype occurred. Black dots represent missing haplotypes in the network. Each branch represents one mutation step."
