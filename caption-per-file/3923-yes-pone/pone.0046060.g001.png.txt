"pone.0046060.g001.png","ITS tree showing the phylogenetic relationship among the Tremellomycetes, with emphasis on the Bandoniozyma clade, obtained by neighbor-joining analysis using Mega 5.0.Most species belong to the order Tremellales, with the exception of Cystofilobasidium capitatum (Cystofilobasidiales), Cryptococcus albidus (Filobasidiales), Trichosporum cutaneum (Trichosporonales), and the outgroup Farysizyma itapuensis (Ustilaginales). The numbers given on the branches are the frequencies with which a given branch appeared in 10,000 bootstrap replications. Bar, substitutions per nucleotide position."
