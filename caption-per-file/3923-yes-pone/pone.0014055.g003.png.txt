"pone.0014055.g003.png","Bayesian inference of the amino acid sequence of pin-c alleles and related proteins shows three independent duplication events.Numbers indicate support for nodes based on posterior probability (Bayesian inference). Sequences of pin-c (NCU03494) proteins are in bold and in color, reflecting allelic specificity. Circles on branches indicate possible gene duplication events. An expanded phylogeny is provided as Figure S1."
