"pone.0060048.g002.png","Phylogenetic analysis of representative vertebrate species based on nucleic acid and amino acid alignments of tsIFN-?3.Unrooted phylogenetic trees were constructed using the full-length nucleic acid and amino acid sequences with the neighbor-joining method within MEGA5 and bootstrapped 10,000 times. The tsIFN-?3 is highlighted in bold. The accession number of IFN-? protein used in this tree can be founded in Material and Method. *indicate proteins that have been characterized; all other sequences are predicated based on whole-genome sequences."
