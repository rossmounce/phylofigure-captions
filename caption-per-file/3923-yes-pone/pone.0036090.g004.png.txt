Tree construction and evolutionary distances were carried out as described in the Figure 2 legend. The analysis involved 32 nucleotide sequences. All positions containing gaps and missing data were eliminated. There were a total of 513 positions in the final dataset. The methodology used for the evolutionary analysis, tree construction and other details are described in the Figure 3 legend."
