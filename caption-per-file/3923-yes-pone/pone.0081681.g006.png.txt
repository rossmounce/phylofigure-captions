Distribution and phylogeny of deduced H. vitripennis Dicer proteins.The evolutionary relationship of H. vitripennis Dicer protein with other insect Dicer proteins is shown. The bootstrap consensus tree inferred from 500 replicates is taken to represent the evolutionary history of the taxa analyzed. Branches corresponding to partitions reproduced in less than 50% bootstrap replicates are collapsed."
