"pone.0071383.g002.png","Neighbor-Joining phylogenetic analysis of the sdAb gene sequences isolated through phage display from na?ve llama library.35 strong positive clones (from a total of 1000 clones) were screened for amino acid homology in the complementary determining regions (CDRs) of the sdAb gene. Out of them, 16 sequences could be efficiently cloned and expressed in E.coli expression system. The shaded clones depict the sdAb genes investigated in our study. Combodies, 26424 and 26434, were derived from BR0042 and BR0043 respectively; whereas the monomer, BR 2.3, was derived from BR0002. The tree topology with bootstrap values for 100 replicates is constructed using CLC Sequence Viewer 6."
