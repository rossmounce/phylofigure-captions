"pone.0014519.g005.png","Identification of Methanoculleus variants.Partial view (A) of pyrosequencing reads aligned to the 16S rRNA sequence of Methanoculleus bourgensis (Genbank accession AY196674). Colored bases indicate differences between reads and the reference (shown in the bottom line). In the depicted part, two of the seven different variants are visible. To characterize the variants, a phylogenetic tree (B) was constructed together with various reference sequences. Most variants show close relationship to M. bourgensis; only variant VAR2 was placed in another branch formed by M. marisnigri, M. palmolei, M. chikugoensis and M. thermophilus. Several 16S rRNA sequences from the genus Methanoculleus were used: M. olentangyi (AF095270), M. bourgensis (AY196674), M. palmaeoli (Y16382), M. thermophilus (AB065297), M. chikugoensis MG62 (AB038795) and M. marisnigri JR1 (CP000562 (Memar_R0043)). Additional sequences in increasing taxonomic distance were included as outgroups: Methanosarcina mazeii (MMU20151), Methanococcus vannielii SB (CP000742 (Mevan_R0025)), Clavibacter michiganensis ssp. michiganensis NCPPB 382 (AM711867 (CMM_RNA_0001)) and two sequences from Escherichia coli K12 DH10B (NC_010473 (ECDH10B_3945 and ECDH10B_2759))."
