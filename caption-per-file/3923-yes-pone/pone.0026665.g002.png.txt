"pone.0026665.g002.png","Phylogenetic analysis of Globoconella inflata. ITS-based evolutionary relationships between 135 clones of G. inflata from 41 localities in the world oceans (see Table 1 and Figure 1 for station names and locations). This Maximum Likelihood inference shows the relationships between the two phylotypes (Type I in red and Type II in blue). The bootstrap scores (500 replicates) greater than 80% are given next to branches for each dataset following a CleITS/CloITS/LarITS/ComITS-dataset order. The scale and branch lengths are given in % of nucleotide substitution per site. The colors associated to leaf labels indicate geographic area of collection: blue = subpolar Indian Ocean; light blue = subpolar South Atlantic; Pink = South Atlantic north of the Subpolar Front; Yellow = Indian Ocean north of the Subpolar Front; red = North Atlantic; green = South Pacific; Orange = North Pacific. Circles, stars and squares associated to specific colors indicate clones sequenced from the same individuals."
