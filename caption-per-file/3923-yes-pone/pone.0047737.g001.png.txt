STING sequences through vertebrate evolution.A.Multiple alignment of STING sequences from zebrafish and other vertebrates. Identical positions are boxed in black, conservative positions in grey and block of similar residues in light grey. The residues of the 5 putative transmembrane (TM) regions and the putative RXR ER retention motifs found in zebrafish STING sequence are boxed. Zebrafish (HE856619, this study), Danio rerio; human (NP_938023), Homo sapiens; mouse (NP_082537), Mus musculus; chicken (E1C7U0), Gallus gallus; xenopus (NP_001106445), Xenopus tropicalis. B.NJ phylogenetic tree of vertebrate STING. The tree was based on multiple alignments of full-length and partial STING amino-acid sequences from fish and other vertebrates. The tree is drawn to scale. Full-length sequence accession numbers are the following: EPC (HE856620, this study), Pimephales promelas; goldfish (JF970229), Carassius auratus, the others are listed above and partial STING amino-acid sequences were deduced from the following EST sequences: salmon (GE786872), Salmo salar; weather loach (BJ827384), Misgurnus anguillicandatus. C.Conserved synteny around the TMEM173 gene in zebrafish, mouse and human. The location of the different markers and the chromosomes involved are indicated for the different species."
