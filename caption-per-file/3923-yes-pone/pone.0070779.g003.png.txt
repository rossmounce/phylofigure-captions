Unrooted neighbour-joining for orbivirus polymerase VP1(Pol) proteins.An unrooted NJ phylogenetic tree for orbivirus VP1(Pol) proteins was constructed using a p-distance algorithm and pairwise deletion parameters, as indicated in Figure 1. The CORV-MRM1 isolate characterised in this study is indicated in red font in amber coloured circle. Full names of virus isolates and accession numbers of polymerase sequences used for comparative analysis are listed in Table S1 (supplementary data). ?e? and ?w? after serotype number indicate eastern and western topotype strains, respectively."
