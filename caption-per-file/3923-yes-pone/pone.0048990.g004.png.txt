Consensus vertebrate phylogeny.Consensus phylogeny from datasets with the 10% most putatively biased sites removed. (A) Turtles are either the sister group to Crocodilians or Archosauria. (B) Lissamphibia: salamanders (Caudata) and caecilians (Gymnophiona) are sister groups, and this group is either the sister group to frogs (Procera hypothesis) or Amniota (rendering Lissamphibia paraphyletic). RAxML bootstrap values are at nodes, with ?*? representing support ?95."
