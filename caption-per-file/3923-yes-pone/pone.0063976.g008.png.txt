Simplified consensus tree based on tatC+atp6 molecular phylogenies.All robust nodes (BP>50+ PP>0.5) were conserved. Polytomy was prioritized for weakly-supported nodes (BP<50 or PP<0.5). Molecular and non-molecular characters that are synapomorphies/diagnostic characters of the clades are indicated on the corresponding nodes. The absence of vacuolar cells (1) is diagnostic of A. The presence of cortex (2), leuconoid aquiferous system (3) and diplodal chambers (4) are specific characters of Oscarella jarrei. The presence of vacuolar cells in O. balibaloi is a reversal character (5) The two new species names are indicated in bold in the tree. In light grey are specimen/species for which uncertainties remain (new species or not). Schemas of morphological characters are modified from [60] or are new."
