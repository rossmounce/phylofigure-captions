pol gene ML phylogenetic tree of non-B HIV-1 Panamanian sequences and 50 highly similar (nucleotide similarity > 94%) sequences from other countries selected with Blastn analyses.(A) BC recombinant. (B) BF1 recombinant. (C) BG recombinant. (D) subtype F1 (E) subtype C. Panamanian non-B sequences are shown in highlighted red color. The tree was rooted using reference subtype sequences. The numbers along branches correspond to aLRT values. Bar is in nucleotide substitutions per site. The pie chart shows the proportion of countries represented by the Blastn analysis. Countries correspond with defined colors which are specified in each pie chart."
