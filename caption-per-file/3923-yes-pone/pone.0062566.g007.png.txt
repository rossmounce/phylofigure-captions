"pone.0062566.g007.png","Summary of patterns of geographic dispersal, sepal evolution, and reticulate speciation in Clermontia inferred from ISSR, plastid, and combined molecular data and morphological variation.Cladogram illustrates phylogenetic relationships among non-reticulate taxa based on MP. Branch color represents inferred ancestral distribution under parsimony; presence/absence of dashed line represents presence/absence of petaloid sepals. Curved arrows, colors, and dashed lines leading to the right represent apparent hybrid/introgressive origins of five reticulate taxa and the distribution of parental taxa. Superscript 's on the latter indicate the presence of petaloid sepals. Curved arrow leading to the left represents apparent introgression of petaloid sepals into Cl. persicifolia from Cl. oblongifolia (and, ultimately, from Cl. grandiflora). The basal split of Cyanea into orange- and purple-fruited clades is shown, together with the particular species of Cyanea thought to be involved in the origins of Cl. pyrularia and Cl. tuberculata based on morphology and/or geographic distribution."
