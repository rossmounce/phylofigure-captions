"pone.0088905.g009.png","Cladogram of basal Theropoda and phylogenetic position of Torvosaurus gurneyi.Strict consensus cladogram from 71 most parsimonious trees after pruning Magnosaurus, Poekilopleuron, Streptospondylus and Xuanhanosaurus from the full set of most parsimonious trees. Initial analysis used New Technology Search using TNT v.1.1 of a data matrix comprising 353 characters for two outgroup (Eoraptor and Herrerasaurus) and 60 nonavian theropod taxa. Tree length = 1022 steps; CI = 0.414, RI = 0.685. Bremer support values are in regular and bootstrap values are in bold.
