Neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree.The tree, which uses the Jukes-Cantor model of evolution, is based on 16S rRNA gene sequences (>1,200 bp) showing the relationships between isolates GOS-2, GOS-3a, TGOS-10 and representatives of related taxa. These isolates clustered together with several other EPS-producing halomonads that are marked with an asterisk. Filled circles indicate nodes with bootstrap values (1,000 bootstrap replications) greater than 90%; open circles indicate bootstrap values greater than 60%. Pyrosequence phylotypes with >97% sequence identity to any one or more of the Halomonas isolates were added using the ARB maximum parsimony quick-add feature (dashed branches). GenBank accession numbers are shown in parentheses. Zymobacter palmae (D14555) was used as an outgroup. Bar, 5 substitutions per 100 nucleotide positions."
