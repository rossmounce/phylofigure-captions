"pone.0032486.g003.png","A phylogenetic tree inferred from 16S rDNA sequences of novel bacterial phylotypes. These novel phylotypes exhibited sequence similarities of less than 98% to known bacteria available in the GenBank database, and they were classified in silico using “Classifier” program. Phylotypes are reported according to their genus or by the last possible classification determined by the program. When possible, phylotypes with the same classification are clustered together. The frequency of phylotypes in each cohort is shown on the right.. Bacteroidetes are shown in purple, Firmicutes in red, Proteobacteria in blue, Actinobacteria in yellow, Acidobacteria in orange and Spirochaetes in green. CAP, community-acquired pneumonia; VAP, ventilator-associated pneumonia; NV ICU-P, non-ventilator ICU pneumonia; AP, aspiration pneumonia; and CS, control subjects."
