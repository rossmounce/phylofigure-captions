An ultrametric phylogeny on which the Fitch method does not have monotonic accuracy.When the Fitch method is used, the accuracies of reconstructing the root state from taxa a, i, b, e and from all taxa are 0.921926 and 0.915298 in the two-state Jukes-Cantor model, respectively. The Newick format of the tree is ((g:2.1553,d:2.1553):47.8447,(((f:0.8271, a:0.8271):14.1190, (h:5.2352,i:5.2352):9.7109):10.0613,(e:21.7263,(c:4.2160,b:4.2160):17.5103):3.2811):24.9926), where the branch lengths are scaled 100 times. The conservation probability on a branch of length is , where is set to 0.25."
