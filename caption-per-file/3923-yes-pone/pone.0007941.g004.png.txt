Amino acid sequence alignments and phylogram.(a) Alignment of amino acid sequences from eight lipoprotein-1 genes. The ClustalW2 program was used. The color code and symbols shown in the figure are as described in Figure 3b. Homologs of lipoprotein-1 gene BBU29805_E23 were found by a protein blast search of B. burgdorferi 29805 strains using the blastp algorithm, protein-protein BLAST (website http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi). The aa sequence of BBU29805_E23 was used in the search to find paralogous genes. The four full-length homologs have an identity of 99–100% relative to BBU29805_E23. The identity of the four truncated paralogs relative to BBJ_02 is 97%. The identity between BBU29805_E23 and BBJ_02 is 73% with E = 3e−25. (b) Phylogram of the eight lipoprotein_1 amino acid sequences. Phylogram shown is as determined by the ClustalW2 program. The branch lengths of the tree are proportional to the degree of evolutionary change."
