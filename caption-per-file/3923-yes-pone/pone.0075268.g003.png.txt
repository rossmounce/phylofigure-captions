"pone.0075268.g003.png","Phylogenetic analysis of functionally characterized plant glycosyltransferases and sequence comparison of zeatin specific binding site.Phylogenetic analysis was conducted in MEGA5 [56] using the Neighbor-Joining method [57]. Accession numbers, references and details regarding substrate acceptors, donors and products for the UGTâ€™s used in phylogenetic analysis are provided in Table S1. Taxon names include abbreviation of species and UGT systematic name (or alternative name if nomenclature name is not available). The amino acid sequences were aligned using MUSCLE program [58]. The bootstrap consensus tree inferred from 1000 replicates [59] represents the evolutionary relationship of the UGTs. Branches corresponding to partitions reproduced in less than 50% bootstrap replicates are collapsed. The percentage of replicate trees in which the associated UGT clustered together in the bootstrap test (1000 replicates) is shown next to the branches. The tree is drawn to scale with branch lengths in the same units as those of the evolutionary distances used to infer the phylogenetic tree. The evolutionary distances were computed using the Poisson correction method [60] and are in the units of the number of amino acid substitutions per site. The analysis involved 41 amino acid sequences. All positions containing gaps and missing data were eliminated. There were a total of 337 positions in the final dataset. Nodes representing different UGT families are labeled by empty diamonds. Classes of substrate acceptors are shown from right."
