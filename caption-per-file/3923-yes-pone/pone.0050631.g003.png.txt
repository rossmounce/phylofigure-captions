‘Gene’ trees.Twelve 70% BS consensus trees summarised from parsimony and maximum likelihood phylogenetic analyses of individual non-recombinant regions (presented on two pages; A and B). Differences in topologies with respect to the positions of recombinant taxa are highlighted and the corresponding recombination events indicated. The trees are presented with the major groupings (PVYC/NONPOT, PVYO and PVYN-North America, and PVYN-Europe), between which the recombinants switch, ordered consistently from top to bottom; these are also indicated by red, yellow, light blue and dark blue bars respectively. Where resolution of particular trees is too limited to retrieve these clades their membership – give or take recombinants – is assumed to be consistent with previous or subsequent trees."
