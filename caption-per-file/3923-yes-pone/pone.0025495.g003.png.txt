"pone.0025495.g003.png","Network and phylogeny for ANT. a) Median-joining allele network for Styela plicata using ANT results. Area of circles is proportional to the number of individuals found for each allele. Partitions inside the circles represent the proportion of each population within each allele. Small circles represent missing alleles. Lines between circles represent one mutational step and non-synonymous substitutions are indicated with an asterisk; b) Phylogeny of partial ANT gene sequences using Bayesian inference. The congeneric species Styela gibbsii was used as an outgroup. Posterior probabilities are indicated when >0.5. The dot line mark the clade corresponding to sequences with a 22 amino acid deletion."
