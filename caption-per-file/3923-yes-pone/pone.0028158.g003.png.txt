"pone.0028158.g003.png","Amoebae found in the hay infusion enrichment are closely related to Naegleria spp. The evolutionary relationships of the rDNA sequences from the hay infusion were determined by bootstrap analysis using RAxML and are presented in A (only bootstrap values ≥50% are shown above the branches). Accession numbers follow the species name and sequences identified in this study are represented by the name “hay” followed by the accession number (A). The eukaryotic rRNA-targeted FISH (C) overlaid with the phalloidin (actin) stain (D) links phylotype with amoeboflagellate morphology in the hay infusion enrichment (B–E). The image overlay (also see 3D stack in Video S3) shows the eukaryote ssu rRNA probe (green), phalloidin stain (red), and DAPI nucleic acid stain (blue) (E). Scale bar = 10 µm."
