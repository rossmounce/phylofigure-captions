Maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree showing the position of different OTUs identified in PDP1 drillcore and control (laboratory, drilling fluid, sawing fluid) samples.The tree was constructed including the closest possible cultivated members to our sequences. The number of phylotype counts in SSU rDNA libraries from different samples is given on the right. Phylotypes are color-coded attending to their classification along a gradient going from indigenous and potentially indigenous to laboratory contaminants. Clones considered indigenous or potentially indigenous were found exclusively in PDP1 drillcores, having no close relatives (>95% identical) in control contaminant libraries or in the sawing fluid-associated library. Only bootstrap values above 50% are given at nodes."
