Comparative genomic analysis of GH family 5 EGs among fungal species.(A) Maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree of catalytic domains of GH family 5 EGs in P. decumbens (in green color), T. reesei (Tr), P. chrysogenum (Pc), A. niger (Ag) and A. oryzae (AO). Two EGs in A. oryzae (AO090003001342 and AO090005000423) showing sequence identity with cluster III members were not included in the analysis for possible incorrect protein prediction. (B) Syntenic analysis of the genomic region around the PDE_00507 gene among P. decumbens (scaffold_1?1,391,035-1,411,127), P. chrysogenum (contig Pc00c16?3,512,265-3,508,864) and A. fumigatus (chromosome_1?4,317,818-4,314,645). Suffixes of gene IDs or GenBank accession numbers (PDE_005** for P. decumbens, XP_0025617** for P. chrysogenum and Afu1g159** for A. fumigatus) are shown in panel B."
