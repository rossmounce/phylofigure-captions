Phylogeny of PPP catalytic subunits in insects. The phylogeny of 287 insect PPP catalytic subunits is presented. Enzyme subfamilies are labeled in line with the D. melanogaster nomenclature (see Table 1). The color codes for the non-Drosophila species are given in the lower right corner, species abbreviations are listed in Table 2. The scale indicates 0.2 amino acid substitutions per site in the primary structure. Uncertain branching points are circled and labeled with the appropriate bootstrap value. The following 8 short, partial polypeptide sequences were excluded from the comparisons: Dsim flw, Dana Pp1-Y1, Dsec Pp1-Y2, Dwil PpN58A, Dyak Pp2B-14D, Dvir Pp2B-14D, Dsim CanA-14F, Dsim rdgC."
