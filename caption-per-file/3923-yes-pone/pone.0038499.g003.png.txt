"pone.0038499.g003.png","Phylogenic tree of L1 nucleotide sequences.Bayesian phylogeny (using the Tamura-Nei model TN93 with gamma distribution and invariant sites) of the main alpha, beta, gamma, mu and nu papillomaviruses infecting human inferred from their L1 nucleotide sequences (the list of the taxa included all sequences available from the PAVE database and are available at: http://pave.niaid.nih.gov/#prototypes?type=human). The new sequences (red branches) and species reported here belongs to the Gammapapillomavirus genus only, therefore, Alphapapillomavirus and Betapapillomavirus subtrees have been collapsed for clarity reasons. The tree is rooted by a bird Etapapillomavirus: the Fringilla coelebs Papillomavirus (FCPV). The added animal papillomaviruses to the phylogeny are the Roussetus aegyptiacus papillomavirus type 1 (RAP), the Bovine papillomavirus 8 (BPV8) and the Ovine papillomavirus (OPV) type 3. Posterior probabilities are reported for each node and sequences obtained during this study are depicted by grey/red branches. Each Human papillomavirus is noted HPV followed by the number of the species and by its Genbank accession number."
