Teleost Hsp90 phylogenetic analysis.Neighbour-Joining (A) and Maximum Likelihood (B) trees showing phylogenetic relationships between cytosolic Hsp90s from different teleost species. Branches containing Atlantic salmon Hsp90α paralogues are highlighted in red and those with Hsp90β in blue. Phylogenetic trees were constructed from a highly confidence alignment of 37 sequences. Trees were constructed using JJT+G as best fitted evolutionary model. Resulting trees were constructed using MEGA5 with 500 bootstrap repetitions. Bootstrap-posterior values are indicated on the node of each branch."
