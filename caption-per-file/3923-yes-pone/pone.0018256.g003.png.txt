Congruence analysis between MIRU-VNTR typing, deligotyping and spoligotyping. A selection of 137 isolates was used, representing the diversity of the different lineages and subgroups predicted based on MIRU-VNTR typing, spoligotyping and the MIRU-VNTRPlus database (see text, Table 3 and Fig. 1). A. A MIRU-VNTR-based dendrogram was generated using the neighbor-joining algorithm and rooted using a M. prototuberculosis C/D genotype (alias M. canettii) as outgroup. Solid coloured circles on tree nodes indicate MIRU-VNTR groupings that are monophyletic when compared to LSP-based (deligotyping) and/or (when deligotyping was not informative) spoligotyping-based groupings. Partially monophyletic groupings are indicated by coloured rings. B. MIRU-VNTR-based minimum spanning tree. The same isolates were used as in the neighbor-joining tree. Colours and grouping names correspond to those of panel A. Distances between circles are proportional to the number of allele differences between MIRU-VNTR genotypes; circle sizes are proportional to the numbers of isolates sharing an identical genotype. Del, deligotyping probe; RD, region of difference (reference LSP, see Table 1); spol, spoligotyping spacer; LAMu, unclassified LAM isolate. Color codes of phylogenetic groups (see text for further description): yellow, Indo-Oceanic (LSP)/EAI (spoligotyping); grey, S; light purple, X; red, Haarlem; blue, Brazil 1; dark purple; Brazil 2; pink, LAM II; khaki, LAM I; green, LAM III."
