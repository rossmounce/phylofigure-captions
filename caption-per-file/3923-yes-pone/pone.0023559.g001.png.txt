Best maximum likelihood phylogeny for the Campanulaceae based on concatenated atpB, matK, and rbcL DNA sequences. Outgroups have been removed for clarity. Pie graphs on branches indicate relationships that are well-supported under one or more of the three tree-building methods that we employed. Black-filled segments of the graphs indicate maximum parsimony (upper left) or maximum likelihood (upper right) bootstrap values ≥75, or Bayesian posterior probabilities ≥0.95 (bottom). Gray shading denotes North American species."
