"pone.0055480.g003.png","Unrooted trees representing the phylogenetic relationships among Chinese HEV85 strains and other members of HEV-B.The phylogenetic trees based on nucleotide sequences for VP1 coding sequences (a), P1 coding sequences (b), P2 coding sequences (c), and P3 coding sequences (d) were constructed from the nucleotide sequence alignment using the neighbor-joining algorithm of the MEGA 5.0 software. Numbers at nodes indicate bootstrap support for that node (percent of 1000 bootstrap pseudoreplicates). The scale bars represent the genetic distance, and all unrooted trees have the same scale."
