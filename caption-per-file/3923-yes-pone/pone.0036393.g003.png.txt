A. Phylogenetic tree based on amplified and cloned sequences of 16S rRNA genes for the Snodgrassella phylotype from individual bees collected at the Arizona and Maryland sites, and with several previously published sequences from bee-associated bacteria corresponding to the Snodgrassella phylotype. Singletons were removed before analysis so clusters at branch tips represent sequences that are identical or differ only in single sequences. B. Sets of identical sequences within the 1250 bp 16S rRNA sequences for Gilliamella and Snodgrassella. Each set of identical sequences is represented as a single column of symbols corresponding to colony and site of the sample. Identical sequences were only found for samples from the same site and were usually clustered within an individual bee."
