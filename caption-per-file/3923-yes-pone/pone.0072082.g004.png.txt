The molecular phylogenetic analysis of the orthologous PME genes, and pro and PMEI domains.(A) The phylogenetic analysis of the pro and PMEI domains in 10 species using the neighbor joining method. The blue lines represent the pro domain, and the red lines represent the PMEI domain. (B) The consensus sequence alignment shows the conserved motifs of the pro and PMEI domains in the representative species. The MEME program was then used to verify the conserved motifs."
