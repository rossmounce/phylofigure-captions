Phylogenetic tree of Edwardsiella species.(A) Maximum likelihood phylogeny based on all filtered SNPs across 8 Edwardsiella genomes. Branches are colored according to the main phylogeographic lineages of Edwardsiella bacteria. (B) NJ tree of 48 Edwardsiella strains inferred from concatenated alignments of partial coding sequences of glyA, mdh, pgi, fusA, aspA and tpi genes with 100 bootstrap iterations. Strains investigated in this study are indicated in bold font."
