Fungal phylogenetic tree based on James et al. (2006), White et al. (2006), and Hibbett et al. (2007), and major sterols associated with each taxon.The zygosporic fungi are indicated by flagellated cell diagrams and zygosporic fungi, by zygospore diagrams. Filled squares indicate the predominant sterol present within a terminal taxon (usually a phylum). Distinctive sterols are present in some clades within phyla: 1 Erysiphales; 2 Tuber and Terfezia also contain some ergosterol; 3 Pneumocystis; 4 Schizosaccharomyces; 5 Taphrina and Protomyces; 6 several core polypores; 7 Pucciniales; 8 one member of Mucorales reported to contain 22-dihydroergosterol; 9 several members of Mucorales contain episterol; 10 Kickxellales; 11 Most members of Entomophthorales contain 24-methyl cholesterol although several are known to have cholesterol or 24-methylene cholesterol or mixtures of 24-methyl cholesterol and 24-methylene cholesterol; 12 Catenaria anguillulae; 13 Allomyces macrogynus; 14 most species of Chytridiales tested; 15 Rhizophydium sphaerotheca; 16 only Spizellomyces punctatum sampled; 17 only Monoblepharella sp. sampled. Mesomycetozoa (Mendoza et al. 2002) is considered to be the sister group to fungi, and this group is poorly sampled. Note that many clades are undersampled or completely unsampled (see text for details)."
