Alternative scenarios of carpenter bee relationships with likely implications for origins of sociality. Studies conflict over whether Manueliini or Xylocopini is the most basal tribe the Xylocopinae. All allodapines are social and most ceratinines and xylocopines are social, whereas the only two well-studied species of Manuelia are solitary. A Manueliini-basal phylogeny (left) would make it more likely that sociality is not the ancestral state for the subfamily as well as imply a more recent origin of sociality. Arrows contrast the possible ranges in timings of social origins, but more than one origin is still possible under both scenarios."
