"pone.0068681.g004.png","Phylogenetic analysis of Qc-SNAREs from Verticillium and other fungal species fungal species.The entire amino acid sequences of Qc-SNARE proteins of Verticillium and other fungi were aligned using Clustal X and the MP phylogenetic tree was constructed using PhyML package with kimura model under 100 replicatations of bootstrap analysis. Separate clades are indicated by vertical bars, branch times values were given. Qc-type Use1 of E. cuniculi was used as an outgroup."
