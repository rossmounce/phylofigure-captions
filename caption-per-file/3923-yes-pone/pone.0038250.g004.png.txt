Phylogenetic relationship between soybean and Arabidopsis genes in each orthologue group.Arabidopsis genes that are known as flowering genes are shown in red along with their closest soybean homologues in the corresponding phylogenetic trees, which are most likely to be orthologues of Arabidopsis flowering genes. Numbers in each branch indicate the confidence value calculated from 1000 times of bootstrapping. Putative orthologues of A. lyrata, Medicago and Brachypodium are also included in the phylogenetic trees. Gene names starting with ‘AT’, ‘Glyma’, ‘Alyr_’ and ‘Bradi’ are for genes of A. thaliana, soybean, A. lyrata and Brachypodium, respectively. Medicago gene names start with either ‘Medtr’ or ‘AC’. To clarify relationships between different nodes diverse tree formats for OGs are used. The Arabidopsis genes marked with ‘*’ have not been identified and investigated as flowering genes. Phylogenetic tree for OG5_127186 (A), OG5_139532 (B), OG5_163423 (C), OG5_131236 (D), OG5_147254 (E), OG5_146543 and OG5_126706 (G) is shown."
