"pone.0068242.g003.png","Results from the Integrative Taxonomic (ITAX) and Wiens and Penkrot (WP) approaches to species delimitation.Taxonomies are summarized above each figure by a horizontal multicolored bar, each segment representing a different species. A: Application of the ITAX protocol on the mtDNA gene tree. Four distinct criteria have been applied for speciation delimitation within the genus Madascincus. White lines connecting terminal taxa represent occurrences of sympatry (localities a-i) between major clades. B: Application of the WP protocol on the mtDNA gene tree. All the seven focal species tested represent exclusive haplotype lineages, with the exception of M. polleni. Two haplotypes have being considered as the minimal acceptable sampling to support the distinctiveness of a given species. Therefore, species revealed by the WP protocol that were represented by a single haplotype (white circle) were merged with their sister species. The unique sample of M. stumpffi from Antanambao (red circle) constitutes the only exception to this rule: this sample represents the sister lineage of two clades (Files S1 and S2) which are both well sampled and recovered as distinct species. Therefore, in accordance with the concept of phylogenetic species on which this protocol is based, the distinctiveness of the Antanambao sample as a third species has been validated. Red lines represent a selection of the most relevant instances of “gene flow” within each inferred species."
