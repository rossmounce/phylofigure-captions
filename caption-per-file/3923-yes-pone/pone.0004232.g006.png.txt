Phylogenetic relationships between protein sequences of nine pAPEC-1-associated virulence genes (a) tsh, (b) iss, (c) cvaC, (d) iroN, (e) sitA, (f) iucC, (g) ompT, (h) hlyF, and (i) etsA and related genes from other sources.The phylogenetic trees were constructed by neighbor-joining analysis. The phylogenetic groups are given on the right. Genes from pAPEC-1 (*); genes of APEC (normal arrow); and genes of other ExPEC (round arrow) are indicated."
