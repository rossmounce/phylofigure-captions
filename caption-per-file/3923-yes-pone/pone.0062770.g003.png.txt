Distribution patterns of homologous gene clusters.Panels (A) and (B) are based on all protein-coding genes, panels (C) and (D) are based on the putative effectors. Panels (A) and (C) illustrate the phylogenetic distribution patterns of homologous gene clusters. The numbers above a branch and preceded by a ‘+’ sign indicate the number of clusters that are uniquely present in all daughter lineages, the numbers below a branch and preceded by a ‘−’ sign indicate the number of clusters that are uniquely absent. For example, in panel (A) PnWB NTU2011 and ‘Ca. P. mali’ share six homologous gene clusters that are not found in any of the other three phytoplasma genomes; similarly, 36 clusters are absent in both PnWB NTU2011 and ‘Ca. P. mali’ but are shared by the other three phytoplasma genomes. Panels (B) and (D) illustrate the number of homologous gene clusters shared between each genome-pair, numbers on the diagonal indicate the number of clusters found in each individual genome."
