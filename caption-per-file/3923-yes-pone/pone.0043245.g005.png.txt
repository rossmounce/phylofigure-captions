"pone.0043245.g005.png","Classification of autotransporter barrel-domains.Sequences corresponding to the barrel-domain of autotransporters were defined and subject to phylogenetic analysis (Methods). Motif analysis of all sequences is represented as radiating coloured stripes, where the colours correspond to those used in Figure 4. The length of the line coloured by these stripes is proportional to the number of residues in the predicted barrel-domain. Fourteen types of barrel-domains were categorized based on conservation of motif placement and phylogenetic clustering. Each type is named for a recognized autotransporter found in that group, for example: Group 1 includes PspA and PspB, Group 4 includes EstA and BigE, Group 6 includes NalP. Group 11 sequences have in common that they have no obvious β-motif, and Group 13 has proteins with longer β-barrel sequences including AIDA-I and Ag43. Each sequence has also been categorized as having a “small”, “medium” or “large” passenger domain, with the purple shading indicating total protein sizes. Figure S3 summarizes the sequence features of the C-terminal (yellow) motifs for each of the 14 groups."
