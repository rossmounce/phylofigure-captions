Evolutionary origin of cnidarian and bilaterian Hox/ParaHox complements.A: Evolutionary scenario (on the right) inferred from phylogenetic relationships between cnidarian and bilaterian Hox and ParaHox genes (on the left, simplified topology of figure 1). Cnidarian groups A, B and C branch in paraphyly in respect to bilaterian “posterior” Hox genes (Hox9-14) and form a cnidarian “posterior” Hox group. B: Evolutionary scenarios deduced from alternative phylogenetic position for the cnidarian “posterior” Hox genes (groups A, B and C from figure 4A). B1: A, B and C form a monophyletic group orthologue to bilaterian “posterior” Hox genes (Hox9-14); B2: A, B and C branch in paraphyly in respect to all other cnidarian and bilaterian Hox/ParaHox genes, with thus no orthology with a particular bilaterian Hox or ParaHox group; B3: A, B and C form a monophyletic group orthologous to all other cnidarian and bilaterian Hox/ParaHox genes but not to a particular Hox or ParaHox group."
