Phylogeny of Clermontia (31 populations spanning all extant species except Cl. micrantha, with two outgroup Cyanea species) based on 4532 aligned nucleotides for five non-coding regions of the plastid genome.Branch lengths are proportional to inferred genetic changes down each branch. (A) MP phylogram consistent with the majority-rule consensus of 76 shortest trees based on plastid sequence data. Colored band shows island distribution of populations (see key) and presence (+) vs. absence of petaloid sepals. Numbers above branches indicate bootstrap support levels ≥ 20%. (B) ML phylogram based on plastid sequence data. Numbers above branches indicate bootstrap support levels ≥ 20%."
