"pone.0051027.g004.png","16S rRNA phylogeny of known heritable symbionts and microbes from ants.Maximum phylogeny showing relatedness between ant associates and known maternally transmitted bacteria, thus illustrating the range of candidate heritable symbionts across the ants. Lineages of heritable symbionts are labeled and color-coded to indicate the presence of ant-associates. Color strip circles are used to indicate bacterial taxonomy (inner circle) and ant-association (outer circle). For ease of viewing, several clades on the original phylogeny were collapsed (i.e. those without heritable symbionts). The full tree is presented in Figure S1. Note that lifestyle heterogeneity within Spiroplasma and Arsenophonus lineages means that identified ant-associates are not certain to be heritable. Also note that the two ?possible? symbionts of ants (a Staphylococcus sp. and a Bacillus sp.) were both detected in hemolymph and in eggs laid by queens, suggesting heritability."
