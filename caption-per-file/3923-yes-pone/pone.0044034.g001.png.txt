"pone.0044034.g001.png","Phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rDNA sequences of isolated bacterial strains.The tree is based on maximum-likelihood (Tamura-Nei model) analysis. Bootstrap values (expressed as percentages of 1,000 replications) are shown at branch points. Solid triangles indicate the positions of isolated bacteria in phylogenetic analysis. Bar represents evolutionary distances as 0.05 changes per nucleotide position. W4.2: Klebsiella sp.; W2.3: Serratia sp.; W3 and W3.1: Pseudomonas sp.; and W2.2: Bacillus sp."
