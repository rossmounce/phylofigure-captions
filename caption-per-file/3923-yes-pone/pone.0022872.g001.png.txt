"pone.0022872.g001.png","Small subunit (SSU) rRNA gene tree of 21 representatives of Stemonitida. Tree derived by Bayesian inference and Maximum Likelihood analysis of 1598 nucleotide positions. The tree is rooted with the “Stemonitis” group according to current phylogenies. Results of one million generation Bayesian posterior probabilities/1000 ML bootstrap replicates are shown for each node. A dot on the line indicates maximum support in both analyses, hyphens indicate bootstrap values Table 2. Genotypes are named Lp1–Lp3 and Lc1–Lc8 as in Fig. 2A."
