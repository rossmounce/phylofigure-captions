Diagrammatic representation of fungal phylogeny based on ref. 18 and of their putative globins. Estimates of the numbers of species in parentheses are from the Dictionary of the Fungi [23]. Red bar indicates multicellularity with differentiated tissues; FHb* - unknown N-terminal domain linked to a FHb with an incomplete reductase domain, T1gb - T globin group1. Ratios refer to the number of genomes containing globins versus the total number of genomes analyzed."
