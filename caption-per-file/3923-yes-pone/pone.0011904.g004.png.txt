"pone.0011904.g004.png","Numbers of non-synonymous (n) and synonymous (s) substitutions in the primate Tetherin.The phylogenetic tree was constructed based on a complete alignment of 17 primate Tetherin protein-coding sequences. Shown above each branch is the n/s value. N and S are the potential numbers of non-synonymous and synonymous sites, respectively. The n/s ratios of three primate lineages (excluding their ancestral branches) are shown below their names. Three blue solid nodes represent the ancestors of three primate lineages: old world monkeys (OWMs), hominids, and new world monkeys (NWMs). NWMs diverged from OWMs and hominids about 33 mya (million years ago)."
