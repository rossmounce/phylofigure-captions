"pone.0018177.g002.png","Phylogenetic relationships of the HA and PB2 segments of influenza A/H1N1 viruses in Taiwan. The phylogenetic analyses were constructed using the neighbor-joining method with 1000 bootstrap replications. Branch values of more than 75 are indicated. All of the phylogenies were rooted with the A/New Caledonia/20/1999, which was the vaccine strain recommended by WHO during the 2001â€“2007 influenza seasons. The genome sequences of A/Solomon Islands/3/2006, A/Brisbane/59/2007 and the early isolates carrying the H275Y substitution, A/England/494/2006, A/England/594/2006 and A/Kansas/UR06-0104/2007 obtained from the NCBI database also were included. Different clades were shown by different colors."
