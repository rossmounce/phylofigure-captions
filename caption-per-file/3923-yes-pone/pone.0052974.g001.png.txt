Maximum likelihood phylogram based on rbcL sequences of 179 Amaranthaceae species.Numbers above the branches are ML bootstrap support percentages. Filled orange circles of the first, second and third columns after species names indicate presence of C4 photosynthesis, serine at the position 281 and isoleucine at the position 309, respectively. The figure was composed using iTOL program [62]."
