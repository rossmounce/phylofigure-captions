"pone.0088429.g004.png","Maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree of Pseudomonas gacA genes.GacA gene sequences of E. fluviatilis-derived Pseudomonas isolates (bold) and of most (>90%) isolates and clones present in relevant databases are shown. In brackets after the isolates' entries are their corresponding gacA operational taxonomic units (OTU) as inferred by rarefaction analysis at 97% similarity threshold (Fig. 3). ?Closest type? shows the 16S rRNA gene identity of the nearest type strain to relevant tree entries (see Table S1 for a complete list and details). An asterisk indicates 100% 16S rRNA gene similarity between isolates and closest type strains. ?Phylo group? refers to major, super-specific Pseudomonas phylogenetic lineages as determined by Mulet et al. (2010). Open and close circles on tree nodes correspond to bootstrap values ?70% and 90%, respectively. The scale bar indicates 5% nucleotide substitution per site. The tree was rooted with the gacA gene homologue of Burkholderia pseudomallei strain K96243."
