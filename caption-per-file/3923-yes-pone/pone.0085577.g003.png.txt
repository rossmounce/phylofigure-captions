A phylogenetic tree of C. sinensis growth factor receptor-bound protein with those of other animals.Neighbor-Joining tree was constructed based on amino sequences of CsGrb2 and 18 Grb2 of vertebrates and invertebrates which were retrieved from GenBank. Number at each node shows bootstrap value (1000 replicates). (CAM21966.1, AEB61246, EDM06605, AFI36901, NP_001131100, XP_540431.2, DAA18091.1, CAG46740.1, NP_001126954, AAA16318, CAB59279.1, NP_998200, CCD63850.1, AAN17585, EDX06936.1, XP_002575772, CAX74268, and AAW26772) is GenBank accession number."
