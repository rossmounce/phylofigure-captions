"pone.0042147.g002.png","Maximum likelihood tree of partitiviral RdRp-like sequences.The phylogenetic tree were built using PhyML-mixtures based on a multiple sequence alignment generated using COBALT with the Word Size parameter setting to 3. The base tree was drawn using Interactive Tree Of Life Version 2.1.1 (http://itol.embl.de/). The tree is midpoint rooted. The p-values of approximate likelihood ratios (SH-aLRT) plotted as circle marks on the branches (only p-values>0.5 are indicated) and circle size is proportional to the the p-values. The p-values for the branches relevant to our conclusions are shown. Scale bars correspond to 0.2 amino acid substitutions per site."
