Phylogenetic analysis of Env gene sequences from HIV-1 infected patients. The maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees were constructed with reference sequences from all HIV-1 subtypes. The bootstrap values supporting the internal branches defining a subtype or a CRF are shown. Bootstrap values of 70% or greater provide reasonable confidence for assignment of an individual segment to one or the other genotype. The scale represents number of base substitutions per site."
