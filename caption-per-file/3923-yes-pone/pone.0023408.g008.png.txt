Phylogram and Euclidean distances derived from analysis of the nt3_4foldsynon character coding. In the main figure, bootstrap values ≥50% are displayed above internal branches of the phylogram based on likelihood analysis of the 68 gene segments. All and only those bootstrap percentages that correspond to nodes not present in the nt123_degen1 topology (Figure 1) are in italics, boldface, and brown in color. Units for the phylogram are substitutions / character. In the smaller, inserted figure are shown Euclidean distances based solely on nucleotide composition. Symbols (+, ∇, O, Δ) identify the same clusters of taxa in both the ML topology and the Euclidean distance diagram for convenient cross-reference. Units for the Euclidean distance diagram are per cent."
