Inferred phylogenetic relationship among representative Babesia and Theileria species based on RPS8 (coding and non-coding regions) gene sequences.The RPS8 (coding and non-coding regions) gene sequences were analyzed utilizing Bayesian analysis (Bayes) and maximum likelihood (ML), using Toxoplasma gondii as outgroup. The numbers along branches indicate posterior probability (PP) and bootstrap probability (BP) values resulting from different analyses in the order: Bayes/ ML. The accession numbers of the isolates used in the phylogenetic tree were listed in Table 1. High statistically supported nodes had BP≥85; PP≥0.98; while poorly statistically supported nodes had BP<60; PP<0.90."
