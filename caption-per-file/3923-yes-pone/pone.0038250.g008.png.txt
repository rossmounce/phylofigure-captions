"pone.0038250.g008.png","Expression patterns of soybean genes in OG5_150317.While the expression patterns of the 16 soybean genes in OG5_150317 were spread in different clusters as shown in Figure 6, but those that are in the same clade of the phylogenetic tree tend to have similar expression profiles. The expression data were extracted from the soybean transcriptome data in SoyBase [8]. DAF: Days After Flowering."
