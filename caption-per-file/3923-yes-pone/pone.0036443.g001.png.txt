Dated phylogeny of Mediterranean teleost fishes.Phylogenetic relationships and divergence time estimates of Mediterranean teleosts, inferred from a supermatrix of 6 mitochondrial and nuclear genes. The global phylogeny is given on the upper left, with black branches indicating the part of the tree that is represented on the right panel. Color codes on species names indicate the origin of the species: green  =  extra-Mediterranean species; red  =  exotic species; blue  =  endemic species; black  =  non-endemic native. The green dashed boxes around nodes indicate the 95% credibility interval for the estimated node age. Maximum likelihood node bootstrap support is indicated using different types of circles: back circle  =  >90%, double circle  =  70–90%, single white circle  =  50–70%, no circle  = Table 1. Note that node 20 appears on the left panel of Figure 1d as this node links Figure 1b and 1d. We also show with dashed red lines important biogeographic events: peak temperatures (PT) that occurred during the Cenomanian (93–100 Mya); the Cretaceous-Paleogene (KP) mass extinction some 65 Mya, and the Messinian salinity crisis (MSC) some 7–5 Mya. On the right hand side, names in upper case correspond to teleost orders while names in lower case correspond to families. For clarity, names alternate between black and grey."
