Principles of Phylometabolic Analysis.Panel A shows how phylogenetic distributions of pathways helps interpret the curation of individual metabolic networks. In this case comparison of metabolic gene profiles suggests the orange pathway represents the correct completion. Panel B in turn shows how pathway distributions in turn also suggest evolutionary sequences. Imposing continuity of metabolite production at the ecosystem level allows us to represent those sequences as phylometabolic trees, in which each node represents a functional phenotype with an explicit internal chemical structure."
