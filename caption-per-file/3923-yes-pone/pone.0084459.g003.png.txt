"pone.0084459.g003.png","Maximum likelihood analysis of four phycobilin lyase sequences of the E/F clan (380 aa positions) from marine Synechococcus.For each strain, the phylogenetic affiliation is mentioned between brackets and the pigment type is indicated by colored circles (see Table 1 for details). Series of four numbers shown at nodes correspond to bootstrap values for ML analyses, Bayesian posterior probabilities (PP, ranging between 0 and 1), and bootstrap values for Neighbor-Joining and Parsimony methods, respectively. Only values higher than 0.60 for PP and 60% for bootstrap values are shown on the phylogenetic tree. The scale bar represents 0.6 substitutions per amino acid. The branch bearing the CpeY cluster was shortened for readability (its full length initially was 3.85 substitutions per amino acid)."
