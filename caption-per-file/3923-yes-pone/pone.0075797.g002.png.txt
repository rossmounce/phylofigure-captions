Unrooted neighbour-joining (NJ) consensus tree, based on phylogenetic analysis of concatenated (rrs gyrB rpoB rpoD) sequences, displaying the relationships of nectar-inhabiting isolates (shown as red filled circles [nectar group (NG) 1], blue filled triangles [NG 2] or violet filled squares [NG 3]) and reference strains of Pseudomonas ?sensu stricto? species (shown as numbers, see below).Nectar isolates belonging to subgroup NG 2? are shown within a dotted circle. Evolutionary distances were computed using the Jukes-Cantor method and are in the units of number of base substitutions per site. Cellvibrio japonicum Ueda107T was used as an outgroup. A complete version of this figure is provided as supporting information (Figure S3). Numeric codes for reference strains shown in the tree: 1, P. aeruginosa DSM 50071T; 2, P. agarici LMG 2112T; 3, P.alcaliphila AL15-21T; 4, P. anguilliseptica NCIMB 1949T; 5, P. asplenii ATCC 23835T; 6, P. azotoformans IAM 1603T; 7, P. cannabina CFBP 2341T; 8, P. chlororaphis DSM 50083T; 9, P. corrugata ATCC 29736T; 10, P. extremorientalis KMM 3447T; 11, P. flavescens B62T; 12, P. fluorescens IAM 12022T; 13, P. fragi ATCC 4973T; 14, P. gessardii CIP 105469T; 15, P. guineae LMG 24016T; 16, P. indica IMT37T; 17, P. jessenii CIP 105274T; 18, P. koreensis KACC 10848T; 19, P. lutea OK2T; 20, P. mediterranea CFBP 5447T; 21, P. oleovorans IAM 1508T; 22, P. oryzihabitans IAM 1568T; 23, P. pachastrellae KMM 330T; 24, P. palleroniana CFBP 4389T; 25, P. pertucinogena IFO 14163T; 26, P. poae DSM 14936T; 27, P. psychrotolerans C36T; 28, P. putida IAM 1236T; 29, P. rhizosphaerae IH5T; 30, P. straminea IAM 1598T; 31, P. stutzeri ATCC 17588T; 32, P. syringae NCPPB 281T; 33, P. tolaasii LMG 2342T; 34, P. xanthomarina KMM 1447T."
