Transmission of bacteria from human brain to RAG1?/? mice brains.(A) Comparison of the relative quantity of 16 s rRNA in human and matched recipient mouse brains showed that mean bacterial rRNA levels in recipient mice were present at ?40% of the mean ODC14 brain homogenate rRNA levels but less than 1% for the heated-treated ODC13 brain homogenate (prior to heat-treatment), measured by real time RT-PCR. (B) Mouse host inflammatory gene transcripts (ifn-?, il-1? and il-12) in mouse brains were not induced by implantation of untreated compared to heat-treated human brain homogenates. (C) The bacterial 16 s rRNA sequences from the ODC14 brain homogenates and the recipient mouse ODC14 brains were similar with substantial phylogenetic overlap between the bacterial genera, as evidenced by the 97% similarity for Delftia acidovorans sequences."
