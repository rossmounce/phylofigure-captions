Nodal support is not labeled for fine-scale branching within dwarf phylogeographic lineages (or other species complexes). Color-coded symbols accompanying dwarf lineages correspond to localities in Fig. 1. The outgroup species Gyrinophilus porphyriticus, Pseudotriton ruber, and Stereochilus marginatus are not shown."
