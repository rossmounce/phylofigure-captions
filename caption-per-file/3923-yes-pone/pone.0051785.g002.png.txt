"pone.0051785.g002.png","Neighbor-joining tree of SSU rDNA barcode sequences of soil nematodes and reference nematode species.SSU rDNA barcode sequences of 29 rOTUs from flowerbed and agricultural field soil nematodes (designated with K01rOTU and H01rOTU, and shown in red and blue, respectively) were analyzed with the corresponding SSU rDNA sequences of 107 reference nematodes (Table S1) and the resultant tree is displayed as a cladogram. Orders corresponding to the reference nematode species are indicated on the outside of the cladogram. The clade numbers (Iâ€“V) in the previous phylogenetic tree [21] were also indicated in parenthesis. Numbers on nodes are bootstrap values (>50%). Dilta littoralis (Arthropoda), Gordius aquaticus (Nematomorpha), Priapulus caudatus (Priapulida), Thulinia stephaniae (Tardigrada) were used as outgroup species."
