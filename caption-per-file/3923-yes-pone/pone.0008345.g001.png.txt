"pone.0008345.g001.png","Schematic representing the estimation of ω, the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitutions, along branches of the Drosophila phylogeny.A. Based on initial pairwise calculations of Ka/Ks, three distinct ω parameters were estimated for each set of orthologous genes. One ω was estimated for the Sophophora species group, one for the Drosophila species group, and a third ω was estimated for the branch connecting the two species groups. The branches of the tree labeled with each ω class are indicated by colored boxes. B. To test whether the estimated ω for the branch between the Sophophora and Drosophila groups is significantly greater than 1 for a particular set of orthologous genes, ω is recalculated for that branch with all other branches assigned to a single background ω class."
