"pone.0022420.g005.png","Two-way hierarchical clustering of the variable gene profiles of A. actinomycetemcomitans strains. Columns represent A. actinomycetemcomitans genomes. Rows represent genes. Red and black color cells represent presence or absence of genes in a particular genome respectively. Clustering result shows a similar grouping of A. actinomycetemcomitans strains as phylogenetic analysis where strains from serotype a, d, e and f (excluding strain SC1083) form a group and strains from serotype b and c form another group. Image truncated for brevity."
