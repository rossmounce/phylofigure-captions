"pone.0050875.g002.png","Phylogenetic pattern searched to identify lateral gene transfers.Schematic representation of the phylogenetic patterns searched with PhyloPattern [16] to identify trees harboring a topology indicating a lateral gene transfer of non-metazoan origin in root-knot nematode genomes. Basically, the topology searched is composed of three main clades. In every clade, species or taxonomic division authorized or forbidden as well as their NCBI?s taxonomy identifiers are indicated. The ?receiver clade? must contain at least one sequence from M. incognita or from M. hapla and possibly from other species provided that these species are plant-parasitic nematodes. The ?donor clade? can contain any species but eumetazoan (e.g. bacteria, fungi, plant, ?). The external clade can contain any species but plant-parasitic nematodes. Presence of a node ?A? connecting the receiver clade and the donor clade to the exclusion of the external clade is required and constitutes a minimal phylogenetic support for LGT. Strong support for LGT was assigned when, additionally, a node ?B?, defined as follows was found. This node ?B? must connect node ?A? to the external clade and this node must be detected as a duplication node due to presence of at least one non metazoan species in the external clade."
