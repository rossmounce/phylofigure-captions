Phylogenetic and gene expression analysis of the expansin-like genes from apple and European pear.A) Phylogenetic tree of predicted expansin-like genes from apple and European pear. Predicted expansin-like protein models from apple (MDP prefix) and European pear (PCP prefix) were aligned, and a conserved region of alignment of 313 residues was used to construct the phylogenetic tree Geneious 6.1.6 (Biomatters Ltd, Auckland, NZ). The linkage group (LG) of each model is shown where possible; some models are not anchored (LG-NA) to the genome. Models that represent the best hit for published expansins are labelled additionally as such. DdEXP2 from Dictyostelium discoideum was used as an out-group. Bootstrap proportions for 100 trees were calculated and bootstrap values ≥50 are shown. Scale indicates 0.4 substitutions per site. EXPA, α-expansins; EXPB, β-expansins; EXLA, alpha-like expansins; EXLB, beta-like expansins [50]. mRNA-seq expression levels in ‘Comice’ melting pear (CM), ‘Nijisseki’ (NJ) crisp pear and ‘Royal Gala’ (RG) crisp apple, undergoing fruit ripening in storage show that one clade is strongly associated with fruit ripening (coloured green). The inserted graph shows the expression analysis by qPCR of EXP2 in fruit at harvest and during storage, which corresponds to the mRNA-seq data. Yellow bars: RG, red bars CM, orange bars NJ). RPKM: Reads Per Kilobase per Million mapped reads. Single arrow shows the apple expansin (MdEXPA7) mapped to a quantitative trait locus for fruit texture. B) Alignment of the first 170 bp of apple and pear homologues, demonstrating genome duplication preceded speciation."
