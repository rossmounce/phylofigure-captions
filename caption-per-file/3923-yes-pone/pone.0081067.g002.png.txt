"pone.0081067.g002.png","Phylogenetic analyses of Mnemiopsis leidyi.Phylogenetic and network relationship between the 17 haplotypes identified in the alignment of COI (A) Neighbor joining phylogenetic tree based on nucleotide divergence calculated using Tamura-Nei model. (B) Network relationships among haplotypes for native and introduced populations, inferred by statistical parsimony. Pie charts correspond to sampled haplotypes described in Figure 1. The size of the charts corresponds to the frequency of the haplotype among all samples. Black circles indicate missing haplotypes and each line represents a single mutation step. Colours show different locations for recovered haplotypes: green: native region, blue: Northern Europe, red: Ponto-Caspian region, and yellow: Mediterranean Sea."
