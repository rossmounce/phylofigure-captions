Neighbor-joining tree illustrating the phylogeny of V3 sequences from 17 co-receptor switchers.Sequences were obtained after either population Sanger sequencing on the first (black) and last (grey) plasma sample, deep sequencing on the first plasma sample (dark green: sequence reads predicted as R5; dark red: sequence reads predicted as X4) or single genome sequencing performed on cellular DNA from the last sample ( light green: sequences predicted as R5; light red: sequences predicted as X4). The individual labels contain a patient ID, the sequencing method used to obtain the sequence (S: sanger sequencing; D: deep sequencing; L: limiting dilution sequencing) and, for the deep sequencing reads, an indication of whether it was a major read (M; >10% of all reads) or a minor read (m; <10% of all reads)."
