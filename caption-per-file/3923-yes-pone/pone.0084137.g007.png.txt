(B,C) The phylogenetic analysis and domain prediction of N. bombycis induced BmCTLs and Î²GRPs. The up-regulated genes were indicated by the arrows pointing upward. The arrows pointing downward showed the down-regulated genes. If the genes were not induced in our data, horizontal arrows were used to represent them."
