Selection and evaluation of immunogens used for the production of HPV type-specific anti-E4 antibodies.A) All of the target peptides that were used as immunogens in this study are listed along with their amino acid positions within E4. The peptides that gave rise to type-specific E4 antibodies are boxed. B) The phylogenetic relationship and amino acid sequence alignment of the 10 HPV E4 proteins used to evaluate antibody type-specificity are shown. All of the selected peptide sequences differed from sequences found in other E4 proteins by at least 5 amino acids. Red, blue and green boxes encompass the HPV-16, -18 and -58 E4 peptides, respectively. C) ELISA results comparing the mice and rabbit polyclonal antibody responses against the full length E4 proteins of HPV-16, -18 or -58 following immunization with, (i) peptide 16E435?42, (ii) peptide 58E423?30 and (iii) peptide 18E453?60 (as indicated below the graphs). Antibodies from rabbits and mice showed dramatically different characteristics, even when the same immunogen was used. D) ELISA results comparing the different responses to the same injected peptide (58E458?65) in four inbred BALB/c mice. Reactivity against the peptide immunogen (58E458?65) is shown in (i) on the left, with the corresponding response to the full-length 58E4 protein (ii) is shown on the right."
