The phylogenetic relationships of HN genes including 37 present sequences and 221 sequences from GenBank.The phylogeny of 258 HN gene sequences was analyzed using a Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method with a strict molecular clock in the BEAST program. Colored rectangles labeled clades 1â€“3 represent the three clades identified in Figure 1 containing the 36 HPIV-1 sequences from the present study. Colored rectangles labeled genotypes C and D represent the HN gene sequences from HPIV-1 viruses collected in Milwaukee, WI in 1991. The number following the underscore in each name represents the collection date in years since collection date of the oldest HPIV-1 strain. Branch color corresponds to clade name/HN sequence seen in Figure 3."
