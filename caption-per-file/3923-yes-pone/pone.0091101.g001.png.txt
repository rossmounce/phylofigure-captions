Bootstrap support values are indicated above the branches. Abbreviations used in these trees are ‘Adi’: Acropora digitifera; ‘Ami’: Acropora millepora; ‘Aqu’: Amphimedon queenslandica (a sponge); ‘Cel’: C. elegans; ‘Dme’: D. melanogaster; ‘Hsa’: H. sapiens; ‘Hvu’: Hydra vulgaris; ‘Nve’: N. vectensis; and ‘Spi’: S. pistillata."
