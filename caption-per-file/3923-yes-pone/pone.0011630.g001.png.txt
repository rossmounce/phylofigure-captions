"pone.0011630.g001.png","Skeleton phylogeny of the legumes [after 38], [ 39], [ 40], [ 44].Nodulation in subtended clades is indicated with “N”. Clades with italicized “N” contain some nodulating species, but also many non-nodulators. Most sampled genera in the Papilionoideae and Mimosoideae nodulate. The dotted vertical line next to Caesalpinoideae indicates that this subfamily is polyphyletic."
