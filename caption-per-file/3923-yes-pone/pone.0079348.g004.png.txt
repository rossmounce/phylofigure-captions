"pone.0079348.g004.png","The phylogenetic hypotheses derived from the 11-species data.Amino-acid and nucleotide sequences were analyzed by maximum parsimony (MP) and maximum likelihood (ML) methods, respectively. A Bayesian tree from nucleotide sequences and a MP tree from the 1st and 2nd codon position sequences are also presented. Numbers near the nodes are bootstrap values or Bayesian posterior probabilities (E)."
