Phylogenetic tree of the alkB sequences obtained from sI, sR, sY, s3 and sC soil libraries and from the closely related alkB genes from the GenBank database (A).The tree was constructed using the neighbor-joining (NJ) method and MEGA 5 software. The corresponding colors for the different sampling sites are: red (sI), blue (sR), yellow (sY), black (s3) and purple (sC). (B) The same phylogenetic tree showing the distribution of the alkB phylotypes resulting from the amplification with the different targeting primers. The colors corresponding to the primers used are: yellow - (d), blue - (e) and red - (f). The color white was used for phylotypes that originated from the PCR amplification with more than one primer."
