"pone.0085250.g003.png","Near full length mosaic genomes of circulating recombinant form, CRF58_01B and other established CRFs in Malaysia and Thailand.Recently isolated among PWIDs in Malaysia, CRF58_01B shared two unique recombination breakpoints (indicated in dashed lines) with other established CRFs in the region: CRF33_01B, CRF48_01B and CRF53_01B in the gag gene at HXB2: 2053 to 2095 nt, and CRF15_01B (from Thailand) in the env gene. Maximum clade credibility (MCC) phylogenies were constructed for the shared sub-regions I, VI and VII between CRF58_01B and the established CRFs by including CRF01_AE (sampled from 1990 to 2009 in Malaysia, Thailand, China and Japan) and B/B′ reference strains (sampled from 1983 to 2011 in France, United States of America, Japan, Thailand and Myanmar) downloaded from the Los Alamos HIV database (labelled in black) to discern their evolutionary relationship. Monophyletic clusters (with a posterior probability of 1.0) were indicated with an asterisk (*) at the branch nodes. SIVcpz and CRF01_AE or B/B′ reference strains were included as outgroups but not shown for simplicity. The sub-region trees were scaled in units of time (years)."
