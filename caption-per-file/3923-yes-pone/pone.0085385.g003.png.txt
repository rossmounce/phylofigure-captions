"pone.0085385.g003.png","Ypt1 phylogeny of Phytophthora clade 8b.Phylogenetic tree derived from an alignment of Ypt1 sequence data of 42 clade 8b isolates. The Maximum Likelihood bootstrap support values are shown for all branches. The tree is rooted with three P. syringae isolates (clade 8d). For hybrid isolates CBS 138.87, ICMP14653 (hybrid type 1), CBS 112969 (hybrid type 2) and CBS 112968 (hybrid type 3) the different ITS haplotypes for the three hybrid types are shown in yellow, green and blue, respectively."
