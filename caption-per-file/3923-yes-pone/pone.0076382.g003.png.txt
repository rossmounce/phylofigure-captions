"pone.0076382.g003.png","A phylogram-based illustration of the experimental design and difference in phylogenetic-based community structure between rhizosphere, endosphere, watersheds and seasons for bacterial (A) and fungal (B) communities.Rhizosphere is represented by brown edges and endosphere by green edges. Similarly, two the watersheds are represented by orange and blue edges for Tennessee and North Carolina, respectively. The end nodes represent the two seasons of sample collection. The number at the node represents the p-values (red for insignificant, blue for significant pâ‰¤0.05) generated by comparing the unweighted UniFrac distance metrics between two conditions (left and right nodes) using the adonis function of vegan package in R. Phylograms represent (A) bacterial and (B) fungal communities."
