Species identification of zoanthid samples collected from aquarium stores. Maximum-likelihood (ML) phylogenies of zoanthids showing both the 16S [A] and COI [B] data sets. Support above branches: ML bootstraps/Neighbor-joining bootstraps/Bayesian posterior probabilities. [C-K] Representative specimens for Palythoa spp. (both toxic and non-toxic/weakly-toxic) and Zoanthus spp. (all non- or weakly-toxic) collected from local aquarium stores including: [C] sample 305.11.2, [D] sample 306.37.3, [E] sample 306.39.2, [F] samples 306.39.3 [open arrows] and sample 306.39.4 [closed arrows], [G] sample 305.13.1, [H] sample 306.39.1, [I] sample 305.11.6, [J] sample 305.11.5, and [K] sample 305.11.3. [Red Box] Visually and genetically consistent with Palythoa spp. and containing high concentrations of palytoxins (500–3500 µg/g wet zoanthid). [Green Box] Visually and genetically consistent with Palythoa spp. but non- or weakly-toxic, and [Blue Box] visually and genetically consistent with Zoanthus spp., and non- or weakly-toxic. For [C-K], bar represents 1 cm."
