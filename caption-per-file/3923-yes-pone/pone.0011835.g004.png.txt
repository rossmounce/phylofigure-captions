Iron utilization genes in human Neisseria species.Species and strain names are listed in the phylogenetic tree. N. meningitidis carrier strains are marked with asterisks. Each box represents an individual gene. Genes of the same color belong to the same iron utilization system. Genes connected by a horizontal line are contiguous in the chromosome. Loci confirmed by sequencing to be pseudogenes have a forward slash (/). N. meningitidis and N. gonorrhoeae gene names appear below each column. Genes are listed as locus tags if their iron utilization functions were deduced from other bacteria. General functions appear below the gene names."
