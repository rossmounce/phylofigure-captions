"pone.0083692.g005.png","Domain architecture and phylogenetic analysis of whitefly Sid1.(A) Domain architecture of whitefly Sid1. Figure shows 11 transmembrane domains (red box) separated by extracellular (pink line) and intracellular (blue line) domains. Long N-terminus extracellular domain is present as reported in other insects. Domain architecture is similar to other insects [28]. (B) Phylogenetic analysis of whitefly Sid1 with other insects and C. elegans. Figure shows that whitefly Sid1 clustered with aphids, which complements the result of multiple sequence alignment (File S5)."
