"pone.0046972.g007.png","Osteological, oological, nesting strategy, and ecological characters mapped onto a phylogenetic tree modified from Mayr [23] by the insertion of the BAS specimen to show hypothesised character transitions on the flamingo lineage.Characters come directly from the text. Black, blue, and red numbers illustrate osteological, oological/nest, and environmental characters, respectively. OSTEOLOGICAL CHARACTERS (black numbers): Tibiotarsus: 1: distinct notches on the distal rim of condylus lateralis and medialis; 2: a wide sulcus extensorius; 3: a medially located sulcus extensorius; 4: a longer supratendinal bridge (in comparison with Palaelodidae); 5: a distinct projection of the lateral and medial condyles from the shaft; 6: a distinct and conspicuous sulcus proximal to the medial condyle; 7: lack of a medial ridge in the trochlea cartilaginis tibialis; 8: a rounded and prominent tuberosity for the lateral attachment of the Retinaculum Extensorium Tibiotarsi (RET). Retinaculum Extensorium Tibiotarsi separated from the articular facet of the intercotylar eminence by: 9: conspicuous sulcus; 10: deep sulcus; 11: narrow sulcus extensorius; 12: lateral attachment of RET laterally to the sulcus extensorius; 13: deep intercondylar incision; 14: intercondylar incision extends over lateral condyle to the diaphysis; 15: ridge in the medio-distal portion of sulcus extensorius; 16: tuberosity for the RET medial attachment; 17: shallow sulcus cranial to the trochlea cartilaginis tibialis; 18: deep sulcus surrounded by crests. Tarsometatarsus: 19: a conspicuous crest in trochlea metatarsi III, in plantar view. Skull: 20: presence of salt glands. EGGS AND NESTS (blue numbers): 21: trilaminated eggshell structure; 22: thin outer granulose calcium phosphate layer; 23: eggshell thickness of or approximately 466 ?m; 24: eggshell thickness of or approximately 258 ?m; 25: Layer 3 of or approximately 63 ?m; 26: Layer 3 of or approximately 30 ?m; 27: thin columns in L2; 28: Pronounced spherulitic crystals in L1; 29: Wide columns in L2; 30: moderately pronounced spherulitic crystals in L1; 31: Large cylindrical columns in L2; 32: Bulky spherulitic crystals in L1; 33: 45?30 mm eggs; 34: 90?53 mm eggs; 35: Single egg per clutch; 36: Two to seven eggs per clutch; 37: Floating nest; 38: Twig-nest; 39: Ground nest; 40: Mud, volcano-shaped nest. NESTING ENVIRONMENTS (red numbers): 41: Nesting in lacustrine environment; 42: Nesting in endorheic lacustrine environment; 43: Nesting in normal-oligohaline lacustrine environment; 44: Nesting in oligohaline to mesohaline lacustrine environment; 45: Nesting in mesohaline to hyperhaline lacustrine environment; 46: Nesting in shallow to extremely shallow lacustrine environment."
