Heatmap showing OTUs in different compartments of the horseâ€™s large intestine.Data shown from the ileum (A) caecum (B), right ventral colon (C), left ventral colon (D), left dorsal colon (E), right dorsal colon (F), small colon (G) and faeces (H) found at 0.1% or greater abundance as a percentage of the total number of sequences (accounts for 49.28% of the total sequences). The cladogram on the vertical axis shows the phylogenetic relationship between the individual OTUs included in this analysis. The cladogram on the horizontal axis shows the phylogentic relationship between all the OTUs identified in each sample."
