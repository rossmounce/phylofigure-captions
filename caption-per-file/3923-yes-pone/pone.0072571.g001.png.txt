Analysis of primary structure and conserved domains of SGT1 proteins.(A) Sequence alignment analysis and the predicted conserved domains of SGT1 proteins. GenBank accession numbers: Rice (AAF18438), Wheat (EF546432.1), Arabidopsis (AF439975, AF439976), Barley (AF439974). The black (100%), pink (80%), and blue (60%) boxes represent levels of amino acid identity or similarity. The conserved domains were underlined. (B) The phylogenetic analysis of the amino acid sequence of SGT1 genes from different species. GenBank accession numbers: OsSGT1 (AAF18438), TaSGT1 (ABQ23992.1), TaSGT1-1 (ABO18602.1), TaSGT1-2 (ABO18603.1), HHvSGT1-Barley (AF439974), BdSGT1 (XP_003569394.1), SbSGT1 (EES01101.1), Zm-SGT1 (ACG34278.1), NbSGT1 (AAW82048.1), AtSGT1a (AF439975) and AtSGT1b (AF439976). The tree was generated by ClustalX1.83 analysis with the corrected full-length Hv-SGT1 protein sequences using Neighbor-Joining method (MEGA4.0 software). The bar beneath the dendrogram represents a distance of 0.05 change per amino acid."
