Maximum parsimony phylogram of 24 Poaceae accessions as determined from different data partitions. A) 74 Protein coding genes. B) Large single copy (LSC) region. C) Small single copy (SSC) region. Numbers above nodes are maximum parsimony bootstrap/maximum likelihood bootstrap support values and only one number is shown if the two values are equal. Numbers below nodes are Bayesian inference posterior probability. The inset box in the lower right indicates topological difference form maximum likelihood and Bayesian analysis."
