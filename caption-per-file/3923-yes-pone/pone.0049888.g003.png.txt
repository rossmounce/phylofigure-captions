Phylogenetic distribution of Cyanobacterial metacaspases.Cyanobacterial phylogenetic tree based on 285 core orthologs, after [45]. The number of identified metacaspases have been plotted for each genome that was analyzed. The tree also shows some Cyanobacteria with draft genomes only, which were not included in this study (shaded). The clade encompassing 26 members of the unicellular genera Synechococcus, Cyanobium and Prochlorococcus has been collapsed as none contained metacaspases. The occurrence of the traits nitrogen fixation, filamentous morphology and symbiotic competence is shown in the figure. Letters within brackets, e.g. ?(a)?, are references to the detailed domain architectures in Fig. 2."
