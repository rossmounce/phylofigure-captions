A phylogenetic tree of LGR proteins.Amino acid sequences of indicated LGR proteins were analyzed with Multiple Sequence Alignment by CLUSTALW (http://align.genome.jp/). The proteins form three subgroups: one containing Hu-LHR, Hu-FSHR, and Hu-TSHR; another containing LGR7 and LGR8, whose ligands are small heterodimeric peptides with homology to insulin, including the pregnancy hormone relaxin and insulin-like 3 [33], [34], [35]; and the third containing LGR4, LGR5, and LGR6, including the X. laevis LGR5a, b as well as X. tropicalis LGR5, and LGR6.
