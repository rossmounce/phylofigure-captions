"pone.0095655.g006.png","Evolutionary relationships of aioA sequences.A total of 72 nucleotide sequences and 543 sites were analyzed. The phylogeny was reconstructed by maximum likelihood and GTR+I+G+F was selected as best fit model. Support values for each node were estimated using the Akaike Likelihood Ratio Test (aLRT). Only support values higher than 70% are shown. Reference sequences retrieved from the non-redundant database of the NCBI are shown in black, bacterial isolates (MS-AsIII and MS-AsV) in green, and operational taxonomic unities (OTUs) from As gene clone libraries in blue. Different background colors highlight two Proteobacteria classes â€“ beta- and alpha-proteobacteria."
