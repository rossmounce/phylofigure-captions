"pone.0080435.g003.png","Identification of endolysin.A. Amino acid sequence of IME-EF1 endolysin was aligned and phylogenized with the submitted, confirmed, or putative endolysin from six strains of E. faecalis bacteriophage in GenBank. B. SDS-PAGE and Western blot were used to identify the expression of endolysin in E. coli M15. Lanes 1 and 4 indicate the negative control with the cells transformed with the empty vector pColdI. Lanes 2 and 5 show the cells transformed with recombinant pColdI containing IME-EF1 endolysin gene, whereas Lane 3 was pre-stained with the protein marker. Lanes 1 to 3 were stained with Coomassie brilliant blue, whereas Lanes 4 and 5 were transferred to the PVDF membrane and blotted with anti-His antibody. The black arrow indicates the expressed endolysin."
