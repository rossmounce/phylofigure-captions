Modular arrangement and phylogenetic relationship of UspA2V proteins.The modular arrangements of UspA2V sequence type obtained are shown for MX1, S36:1 and S43:4 (A). Modules are largely based on those identified in previous work on UspA proteins [25], [26]. Where possible, colour coding has been maintained with previous publications, with the exception that the minimal CEACAM binding domain identified is now included as a distinct refined module [27]. Domains are scaled to indicate relative position and size within each protein sequence shown in Figure 6. Note that all protein sequences identified contain the CEACAM-binding domain as indicated. In addition, schematics for UspA2 of strain 035E and UspA1 of strain MX2 have been included for comparative purposes. B) Phylogenetic relationship of UspA2V proteins. A Phylip Tree file was generated by sequence alignments of UspA2V sequences against all complete UspA proteins in the NCBI protein database using MegAlign software. An unrooted phylogenetic tree was generated by viewing the Phylip Tree file in TreeView software. The UspA2V proteins appear to be distinct from UspA1 and UspA2/H proteins previously sequenced. Clusters of UspA1 and UspA2/H are labelled as indicated rather than individual sequences for clarity of the figure. Scale bar represents nucleotide substitutions per site."
