Neighbor-joining bootstrap tree of UGT proteins.The PROSITE consensus sequence of the 11 significantly up-regulated Barbarea vulgaris UGTs transcripts (red), as well as 41 UGTs representative of the Arabidopsis genome (black) and six reported to be involved in saponin biosynthesis (blue), were used to construct the phylogenetic tree. Multiple alignments were performed with Clustal W, and the tree was generated with MEGA 5. Bootstrap values above 50% are shown at the nodes."
