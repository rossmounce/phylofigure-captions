"pone.0021375.g003.png","Lineage-specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in HPV16 variants and their position in the genome. Lineage-specific SNPs were determined from an alignment of the 62 complete-genome nucleotide sequences by selecting the nucleotides that occurred only in members of a given lineage. The value of each SNP is color-coded as shown at the top right of the figure. The SNPs are plotted by position in the HPV16 genome on the x-axis and aligned according to lineage in the phylogenetic tree on the y-axis. SNPs for a given lineage are cumulative as the tree is traversed from deepest node out to branches. Thus, for example, HPV16 genomes of Af-2 lineage (row 6) contain all SNPs shown on the Non-E (row 5), AA/NA1/Af-2 (row 7) and Af-2 (row 6) lines. Regions of the genome are displayed below the x-axis for reference."
