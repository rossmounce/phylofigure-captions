"pone.0054178.g003.png","Phylogenetic relationships among vertebrate and invertebrate I?B members determined using the NJ method.(A) A total of 297 vertebrate protein sequences were included in this analysis (I?B?, I?B?, I?B?, I?B?, I?BNS, Bcl3, NF-?B1 and NF-?B2). (B) A total of 43 invertebrate protein sequences were included in this analysis (Cactus, Relish and NF-?B1). Bcl3 from Nematostella vectensis was considered as an outgroup. Bootstrap scores of >70% have been provided. Each I?B member is represented by a unique color in the phylogenetic tree: I?B? (magenta), I?B? (red), I?B? (cyan), I?BNS (dark green), I?B? (brown), Bcl3 (purple), Cactus (orange), Relish (black), NF-?B1 (blue), and NF-?B2 (light green). Taxa terminologies are presented as the I?B protein name followed by an abbreviated form of the species name. Clade organizations obtained for both vertebrate and invertebrate phylogenies are identical to all I?B phylogeny."
