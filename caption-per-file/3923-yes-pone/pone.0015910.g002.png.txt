Comparisons of Boule and Dazl proteins between rainbow trout and other organisms. (A) Multiple sequence alignment of the RRM. Boule and Dazl proteins share 16 invariant residues (asterisks) and 13 conserved positions (%). There are 21 invariant or conserved residues characteristic of Boule (&) and Dazl (#) proteins each. (B) Phylogenetic tree of DAZ family proteins. The branching between Boule and Dazl coincides with the branching between the fish and tetrapod lineages, and molecular trees on the basis of Boule and Dazl sequences are in accordance with organism relationships, indicating that generation of boule and dazl took place in early vertebrate evolution. Followed species are gene accession numbers. (C) Organism phylogeny and branching times of major fish groups and tetrapod vertebrates. Fish timing is according to [19]."
