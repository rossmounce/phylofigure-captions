"pone.0059394.g003.png","Phylogenetic analyses of partial VP7 capsid nucleotide sequences from rotaviruses.Bootstrap values are shown as percent values for major nodes, and large clusters are collapsed. Black stars indicate sequences obtained from this study. (a) Inferred phylogeny for G9 rotaviruses as determined by a maximum likelihood phylogenetic analysis, including previously defined lineages. Bold brackets indicate consistently defined lineages I, II, and III. Subclusters within lineage III, described by Matthijnssens et al., are indicated in italics, and lineages IV, V, and VI, described by Martinez-Laso et al., are also listed. Strains Hu/RV/G2275/USA/1980/G9 and Hu/RV/DC706/USA/1980/G9 are of indeterminate lineage. (b) Inferred phylogeny for G5 rotaviruses as determined by a maximum likelihood phylogenetic analysis, including previously defined lineages."
