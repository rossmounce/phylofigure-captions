Bayesian phylogenetic tree of wolves, dogs and wolf-dog hybrids (from this study and homologous sequences from GenBank) based on the analysis of mtDNA control region sequences (1134 bp).Nodes with posterior probability values ≥0.80 are shown. Colours: green – dogs, blue – wolves, red – hybrids. Haplotypes representing more than one individual are numbered (circles 1–15). More detailed information about different haplotypes can be found in Table S3."
