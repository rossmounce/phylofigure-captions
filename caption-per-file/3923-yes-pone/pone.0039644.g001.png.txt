Production of virus-like particles of human bocaviruses.(A) Phylogenetic analysis of human bocavirus (HBoV) species. The phylogenetic tree with 1,000 bootstrap replicates was generated using the Clustal W and MegAlign programs in the MEGA 4.0 software package and based on the complete sequences of the VP2 gene of the HBoV strains used in this study. The VP2 genes of the HBoV1, 2, and 3 were obtained from stool samples from children with acute diarrhea in Beijing and are marked with red triangles. HBoV1 strains ST1, ST2, and TW2888_06; HBoV2 strains W153, PK-2255, LZ55602, and 277-BJ07; HBoV3 strains W471 and W855; and HBoV4 strains NI-385 were used as reference sequences (GenBank accession numbers DQ000495, DQ000496, EU984237, EU082213, FJ170279, GU301645, JQ240471, EU918736, FJ948861, NC012729, respectively). (B) Western blot analysis of the HBoV1-4 VLPs detected by mouse antisera against HBoV1, 2, 3, and 4 VP2, respectively."
