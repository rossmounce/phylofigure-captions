Phylogeny of DENV-3 from Cairns, Australia.Maximum likelihood (ML) phylogeny of DENV-3 from Cairns, Australia, from 1998 and 2008 (in bold, with asterix), based on whole-genome sequences. Several other isolates from the region were also sequenced and included (shown in bold, GenBank Accession numbers JN575563-80), along with publicly available sequences (accession numbers available upon request). Analysis was implemented in RAxML Black Box webserver [33] under the GTR+I+G model of evolution, including support at nodes based on 100 ML replicates. Sample labeling includes serotype/ISO country code/strain/year of collection. Genotypes I through V are indicated on the far right."
