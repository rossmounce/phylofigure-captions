"pone.0058681.g001.png","Phylogenetic analysis of MAPs.A phylogenetic tree was generated with the neighbor-joining method using the p-distance in MEGA version 5.04 [47] from all complete MAP protein sequences of Arabidopsis and poplar. Branch lengths are proportional to the amino acid distances along each branch. The neighbor-joining bootstrap values for clusters supported above the 50% level are indicated in the red font above the branches, whereas minimum-evolution bootstrap values above the 50% level are presented in red font below the branches. The blue diamonds are highlighted at the front of all MAPs from Populus.
