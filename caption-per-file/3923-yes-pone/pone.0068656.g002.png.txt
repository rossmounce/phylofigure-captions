CRF07_BC sequences from Guangxi are not derived from Yunnan province.A. Phylogenetic analysis comparing new CRF07_BC sequences from Guangxi to other reported sequences from China has suggested that Guangxi CRF07_BC does not have a direct relationship to those from Yunnan province. gag/pol sequences corresponding to 1850-2961 of HXB2 were used for phylogenetic tree construction. B. A 7-aa deletion within the CRF07_BC P6 region was conserved among our Guangxi CRF07_BC sequences and could be easily detected within sequences from China, but was barely detectable in those from Yunnan. The position of the 7-aa deletion (IDKELYP) is indicated by the short line above the sequences."
