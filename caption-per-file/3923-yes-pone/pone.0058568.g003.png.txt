Summary of three phylogenetic analyses of 483 taxa and 19 genes.Bootstrap percentages derived from GARLI analysis of three data sets -- nt123_degen1, nt123, and nt123_partition -- are displayed in that order above internal branches of a condensed, higher-level-only portion of the nt123_degen1 ML topology (see numbers in black). Selected nodes are arbitrarily numbered for convenient reference (see numbers in blue). The full nt123_degen1 and nt123 topologies are shown in Figure S1 and S2, respectively. A bracket indicates that the node displayed was not recovered in the ML analysis of that data set. A dash indicates that the bootstrap value is <50%. The number of exemplars is listed in parentheses after the family or subfamily name. The region of the topology that includes Tineoidea has blue-colored branches, and its favored alternative topology, based on analysis of nt123, is also displayed (see lower boxed area). Throughout this report, we have subsumed all tineoid taxa traditionally identified as Acrolophidae under Tineidae, all tineoid taxa traditionally identified as Arrhenophanidae under Psychidae, and Crinopterygidae under Incurvariidae, following van Nieukerken et al. [1]. BP, bootstrap percentage."
