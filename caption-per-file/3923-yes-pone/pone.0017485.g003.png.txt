"pone.0017485.g003.png","Bayesian skyline plot and phylogenies of the CRF28/29_BF-like HIV-1. Nonparametric reconstruction of the epidemic history with appropriate confidence limits and time-scaled phylogenies of the pol and gag genes are shown. The demographic history of CRF28/29_BF-like HIV-1 is shown as the median estimate of the effective number of infections through time. The median estimate of the effective number of infections is represented in black, and the 95% confidence limits of the estimate are represented in grey. The trees represent the phylogenetic relationships of sequences belonging to the CRF28/29_BF-like lineage. Both sets of data are shown on the same time scale."
