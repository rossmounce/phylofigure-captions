Consensus Bayesian phylogeny of the Daphnia pulex species complex based on the mitochondrial ND5 gene.The alignment contains 398 sequences of length 496 nt with 241 polymorphic nt positions of which 204 are phylogenetically informative (excluding the outgroup). Posterior probabilities are indicated on the nodes of the tree and are not shown if less than 0.80. The tree is rooted using an ND5 sequence from Daphnia obtusa. Triangles represent clusters that are collapsed to save space and the number of individuals included is shown in parentheses. The large letters indicate the three major groups within the D. pulex species complex: A = tenebrosa; B = pulicaria; C = pulex. The two or three-letter code names of some individuals correspond to sampling locations as follows: ARG = Argentina, BOL = Bolivia, CHI = Chile, CT = Connecticut, USA. The expanded version of this tree showing all individuals is available in Figure S1."
