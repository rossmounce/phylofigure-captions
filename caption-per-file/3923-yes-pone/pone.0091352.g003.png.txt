"pone.0091352.g003.png","Phylogenetic analysis of the identified precursor peptides with ? and ? precursors of well-known two-component lantibiotics.Alpha and beta precursor peptides of the two-component lantibiotics smb (SmbA1: BAD72777; SmbA2:BAD72776), bhtA (BhtA1:AAZ76603; BhtA2:AAZ76602), lichenicidin (LchA1:ADM36018; LchA2:ADM36017), lacticin 3147 (LtnA1:O87236; LtnA2:O87237), staphylococcin C55 (SacA1:BAB78438; SacA2:BAB78439), haloduracin (HalA1:BAB04173; HalA2:BAB04172), plantaricin W (PlwA1:AAG02567; PlwA2:AAG02566), enterocin W (EnwA1:BAL50001; EnwA2:BAL50002.1) and lichenicidin (BliA1:Q65DC4.1; BliA2:P86720.1) were taken for the phylogenetic analysis. Alpha precursor peptides are marked with a pyramid and beta precursor peptides with a diamond. The percentage of replicate trees in which the associated taxa clustered together in the bootstrap test (500 replicates) are shown next to the branches. The tree is drawn to scale, with branch lengths in the same units as those of the evolutionary distances used to infer the phylogenetic tree. The evolutionary distances were computed using the p-distance method and are in the units of the number of amino acid differences per site."
