Phylogenetic analysis of boNT/B nucleotide sequences from various C. botulinum strains.The phylogenetic tree was generated using the neighbor-joining method in MEGA (v5) software. Bootstrap values (the percentage that each branch would occur after 1,000 bootstrap replicates) and genetic distance (bar) are shown. Clusters corresponding to different phylogenetic groups are labeled according to previous reports (Table 1). The toxin serotypes of the strains are shown on the right, and the Thai isolates from the 2010 outbreaks are highlighted."
