"pone.0002018.g007.png","Distribution of representative and non-representative class 1 OGs (C1OGs) and singleton ORFs over estimated rickettsial phylogeny.Boxes depict the distribution of phylogenetic groups, singletons, plasmid associated groups, and host-related groups: Red = AG rickettsiae, aquamarine = TG rickettsiae, blue = TRG rickettsiae, brown = SFG rickettsiae, gray = higher-level groupings, light green = R. bellii strains only. Orange boxes depict genes found on the pRF plasmid of R. felis str. URRWXCal2 and chromosomes R. felis and both R. bellii strains (as of this publication the R. bellii plasmids remain unavailable). Genes specific to single rickettsial genomes (singletons) are in yellow boxes, with taxon abbreviations explained in the Figure 1 legend. Host specific groups are defined by green (insect) and tan (tick) boxes. Genome statistics were compiled from the PATRIC and NCBI databases. Cladogram is based on trees shown in Figure 3. Inset in dashed box describes general schema for each box. *Total R. felis genome size: 1,485,148 bp = chromosome; 62,829 bp = pRF and 39,263 bp = pRFδ."
