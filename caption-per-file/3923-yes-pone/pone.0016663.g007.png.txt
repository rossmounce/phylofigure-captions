Calibrated phylogeny of Neosauropoda. Summarized strict consensus tree showing the relationships among neosauropod dinosaurs and the phylogenetic position of Tapuiasaurus macedoi gen. n. sp. n. The support values (Bremer/Bootstrap) for the nodes labelled in the figure are: Neosauropoda (1/-), Somphospondyli (2/68), Titanosauria (2/58), Lithostrotia (3/68), “advanced titanosaurians” (3/65), Nemegtosauridae (1/-), Saltasauridae (1/-). See Figure S4 for a complete strict consensus tree including all sauropod terminal taxa used in the analysis. Age of first appearance for taxa used in the calibrated phylogeny are given in Text S4."
