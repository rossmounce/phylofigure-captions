"pone.0029323.g004.png","ITS variable sequence block analysis overlaid onto a Burkholderia MLST phylogeny (modified from Gee et al. [37]). The presence (+), absence (-) or partial absence (indicated by the Î” symbol) of variable ITS sequence blocks are described for major species-level Burkholderia clades, based on MLST sequence analysis. Because B. mallei is a clone of B. pseudomallei and possesses an identical ITS type, its clade was collapsed into that of B. pseudomallei."
