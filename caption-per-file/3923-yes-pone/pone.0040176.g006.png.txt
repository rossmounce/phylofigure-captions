Phylogenetic analysis of avipoxvirus from British birds based on the 4b core protein.Neighbor-joining phylogram with bootstrap values (1000 replicates) of >90% shown. Sequences derived in this study are indicated with an asterisk. Details of avian pox isolates from UK non-Paridae species are in Table S2. Details of Genbank listed avian pox isolates are in Table S3. The evolutionary distances were computed using the Maximum Composite Likelihood method and are in the units of the number of base substitutions per site."
