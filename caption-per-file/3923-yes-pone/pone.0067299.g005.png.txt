Maximum likelihood phylogram describing phylogenetic relationships among euthyneuran species (pulmonates and opisthobranchs).Numbers above the node correspond to Bayesian posterior probabilities, and those below the nodes to maximum likelihood bootstrap support. Sequences from Ilyanassa obsoleta and Haliotis rubra were the outgroup used to root the tree."
