Phylogeny, niche specificity and virulence of C. fetus subspecies.MLST tree showing the phylogeny of C. fetus, with original scale as reported [4]. Reptile C. fetus represent a distinct clade harboring mat1 and galE. Diversification of C. fetus subsp. fetus (Cff) type B happened prior to the diversification of Cff type A and C. fetus subsp. venerealis (Cfv) type A strains. Cff type B strains harbor galE, mat1 and wcbK. The latter gene provides protection from acid, and this genotype is associated with animal hosts. Cfv type A represents the bovine clone harboring mat1 and galE which is also prone to HGT. Cff type A have lost mat1 but acquired glf correlating with serum resistance in Cff."
