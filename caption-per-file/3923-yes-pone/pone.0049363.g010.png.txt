Phylogeny and clade organization of proteins endo-? 1,4 glucanases with a C-terminal extension.A rooted consensus tree was constructed from the deduced amino acid sequences of angiosperms and lower plant endo-? 1,4 glucanases with a C-terminal extension. Protein sequences were aligned using CLUSTAL, which was subsequently input into Phylip (see further details in Materials and Methods) to perform maximum likelihood phylogeny reconstruction. Arrows mark AtGH9C1 in CLADE 1 and S1GH9C1, in CLADE 2. The different proteins in the tree are identified by species followed by a letter suffix to distinguish multiple members from the same species. For Arabidopsis the suffix distinguishes the three members of GH9 class C. The branches of the tree are color coded to denote the monocot and dicot members of CLADE 1 and CLADE 2. The specific protein sequence accessions numbers and locus identification for each gene (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) are presented in Table S1."
