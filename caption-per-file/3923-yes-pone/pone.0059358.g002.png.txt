"pone.0059358.g002.png","Unrooted phylogenetic tree of the SBP-box family genes based on amino acid sequences of SBP domains.Red bars denote different groups (or subgroups) of SBP domains. Circles of different colors represent SBP domain proteins from different species. SBP-box genes from Arabidopsis, rice, tomato, and grape that contain complementary sequences for miR156/157 are marked with an asterisk. SBP domain sequences of all genes utilized in this analysis, as well as the accession numbers and data sources of genes from plants are listed in Tables S2 and S3."
