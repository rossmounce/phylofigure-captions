Phylogenetic analysis of Grapevine redleaf-associated virus (GRLaV) using (A) coat protein and (B) replication-associated protein.Maximum likelihood trees were constructed using amino acid sequences of the coat protein (CP) and replication-associated protein (Rep) of GRLaV and representative members of approved genera in the family Geminiviridae. The consensus tree for each gene was drawn to scale using the MEGA5 with the rtREV amino acid substitution model and bootstrap values (1,000 replicates) shown at the nodes. Branches with less than 70% bootstrap support have been collapsed. Colored lines in both phylograms correspond to respective genera of the Geminiviridae family listed on the top left corner."
