"pone.0002281.g001.png","Genetic divergence among three pairs of Plasmodium species.A. Schematic representation of the phylogenetic relationship between sequenced Plasmodium genomes. Three pairs of closely related species (falciparum-reichenowi, vivax-knowlesi and yoelii-berghei) used for analysis are labelled clade 1, 2 and 3, respectively. (The phylogenetic position of P. gallinaceum in relation to the other species is not yet confirmed and awaits full genomic analysis, but is either an outgroup as illustrated here [10], [11] or more closely related to the falciparum-reichenowi clade). B. The distribution of dN/dS for candidate ligand genes and control genes (labelled ‘L’ and ‘C’) between species of each clade defined in panel A. Sample sizes were: clade 1, L = 33, C = 37; clade 2, L = 32, C = 92; clade 3, L = 29, C = 70. Asterisks indicate a significant difference between gene datasets by Wilcoxon's rank sum test (*"
