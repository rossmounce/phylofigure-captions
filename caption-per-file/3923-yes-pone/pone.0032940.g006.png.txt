"pone.0032940.g006.png","Phylogenetic conservation analysis of nucleotide (A) and carbohydrate (B) metabolic networks of M. fermentans M64 and 20 other Mycoplasma species. M. fermentans M64 metabolic networks were served as the references in the comparisons. The small open squares represent the compounds and the colored circles represent the proteins (enzymes) participating in the metabolisms. Circles with thick and light blue circumference denote the potential essential genes inferred from the comparison with M. pulmonis, M. arthritidis, and M. genitalium (Figure 5). The arrows and lines linking the enzymes and substrates indicate the direction of the reactions. Enzymes involved in more than one metabolism are annotated with a single letter code of the other metabolisms (A: Amino acids; C: Carbohydrate; N: Nucleotide; V: cofactors and Vitamins) next to the circles. The color scale (bottom) indicates the phylogenetic conservation of proteins in the analyzed Mycoplasma species."
