"pone.0070950.g002.png","Phylogenetic analysis based on the VP1 coding sequence from healthy subjects.The full length VP1 coding sequence (1065 bp) was obtained for all healthy subjects for which also the non-coding control region (NCCR) was Sanger sequenced (n = 61). The relatedness of the HS samples to defined JC virus genotypes is illustrated in a phylogenetic tree. For each JCV genotype the following reference VP1 coding sequences were used (NCBI accession number between brackets; reference sequences taken from [26]): genotype 1A (AF015526), genotype 1B (AF015527), genotype 2A (AF015529), genotype 2B (AF015533), genotype 2C (AF015535), genotype 2D (AF015536), genotype 2E (AF281606), genotype 3A (U73500), genotype 3B (U73501), genotype 4 (AF015528), genotype 6 (AF015537), genotype 7 (U61771). Healthy subjects (HS) in which deletions or insertions were identified in the non-coding control region via Sanger sequencing are indicated by * (deletion) or (insertion). HSs in which JCV quasispecies were identified by 454 sequencing are circled."
