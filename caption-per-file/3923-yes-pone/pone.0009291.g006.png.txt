"pone.0009291.g006.png","Immunological signatures among CHIKV isolates.a. Cluster-difference amino acid preferences, defined using three timelines: ancient (1950s–1970s), past (1980s–1990s) and present (2000s). b. Relationship between CHIKV immunological signatures. Immunological signatures from reported isolates in outbreak countries were obtained using the nearest neighbor algorithm. Three main clusters can be identified in this study: African, Asian and Indian Ocean phylogroups. The branch leading to Malaysian strain was shortened by 50% for convenience."
