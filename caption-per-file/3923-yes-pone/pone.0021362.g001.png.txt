Comparative phylogenetic analysis of HBoV3-E1 and HBoV2-IB1 (filled rectangles). Nucleotide alignments were generated using the complete coding sequence of the NS, NP and VP genes. Names of sequences used for analysis are shown as Genbank accession numbers followed by the names of HBoV species and strains. The tree was constructed with the maximum likelihood method using a GTR+G substitution model [38]. Bootstrap replicates (>70%) are shown above the branches and distances (>0.02) are shown below the braches."
