"pone.0003325.g003.png","Identification of the alligator HoxD-11 exon 1 sequence.(EU597806): A) alignment of the deduced alligator amino acid sequence with the HoxD-11 sequence of chicken. In exon 1 the amino acid sequence conservation is 87%. B) Maximum parsimony tree of the aligned exon 1 amino acid sequences from HoxD-11, HoxA-11 and HoxC-11 sequences. C) Neighbor joining tree of the aligned exon 1 amino acid sequences from HoxD-11, HoxA-11 and HoxC-11 sequences. B+C) The numbers at the internal branches represent bootstrap support values. Note that the alligator HoxD-11 sequence, AmiHoxd11, forms a well-supported clade with the human, HsaHoxd11, and the chicken, GgaHoxd11, HoxD-11 sequences, confirming that the alligator sequence is a HoxD-11 ortholog. Furthermore, the alligator sequence is more closely related to the chicken sequence than to the mouse sequence, as expected based on the accepted species phylogeny. D) Expression of the alligator sequence in a stage 12 alligator embryo. The embryo is dissected to show the sharp anterior limit of hindgut expression (1). Expression is also present in genital tubercule (2), distal tail (3) and limb buds (4), all known expression domains of HoxD-11 in chicken and mouse that confirm the alligator sequence is a homolog of HoxD-11."
