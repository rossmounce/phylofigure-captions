"pone.0050978.g003.png","Maximum likelihood phylogeny of Ty1 LTR sequences from the reference genome of S. cerevisiae.The phylogeny was created from 731 aligned nucleotide positions. LTRs in red are from partial elements and are no longer capable of autonomous transposition; LTRs in blue are from full-length elements and denoted as being from the 5? or 3? end of the element. Canonical, Ty1? and hybrid Ty1/2 elements are boxed in green, red and blue, respectively. Clades composed entirely of inactive elements have been collapsed and labelled ?Long branch solo LTRs?, while recently active solo-LTRs are individually named. Branches are drawn to scale and the bar represents the number of nucleotide substitutions per site. A ?/? denotes arbitrarily shortened branches and a ?*? denotes branches with both mlBP ?70% and biPP ?0.95 support."
