"pone.0040438.g008.png","Correspondence between MOB and Rep types.A) Simplified phylogenetic representation of the five relaxase MOB families considered in this study. Coloured triangles represent the MOB subfamilies amplified by DPTM. Their width and depth correspond, respectively, to the abundance and phylogenetic diversity of their relaxase sequences (Table S1). B) The Inc groups contained within each MOB subfamily are indicated at the right, boxed in the same colour. When no Inc group is contained, the name of a prototype plasmid is given."
