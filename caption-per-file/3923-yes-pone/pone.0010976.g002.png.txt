Phylogenetic tree of the samples used in the study.Neighbour-joining phylogenetic tree for the 161 HIV-1 pol sequences (1233 nucleotides, corresponding to positions 2253â€“3485 of HXB2). Trees were constructed using 48 representative reference sequences from 9 known subtypes (A through F) and 13 known recombinant strains. The sequences determined in the study are colour-coded, with colours corresponding to the country of sampling: Belgium (light blue), Croatia (dark blue), Cyprus (yellow), Greece (green), Israel (red), Luxemburg (grey), Slovenia (purple), Spain (pink). The divergence between any two sequences is obtained by summing the branch length, using the scale at the lower left of each tree. The numbers indicated at the subtype-determining nodes are percentage bootstrap support for 1,000 replicates."
