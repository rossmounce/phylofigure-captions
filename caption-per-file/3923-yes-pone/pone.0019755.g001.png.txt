Phylogenetic relationship of the F. fragum genes clock and cycle. Tree depicts a radial consensus of 1000 bootstrap replicates using the Neighbor-Joining method with pairwise deletions and Poisson control. Analyses with 1000 bootstrap replicates under Dayhoff or JTT models were also run and resulted in similar phylogenetic relationships (data not shown). Thin lines represent nodes where less than 70% of the 1000 bootstrap replicates show support for the topology depicted above. Gray lines represent cnidarian lineages."
