Positive selection at c-type lysozyme across the invertebrate phylogeny.The number shown along each branch is the non-synonymous to synonymous rate ratio for the entire gene along that branch. The branches in red show strong evidence of undergoing positive selection. C – Crustacea branch, B – Bivalvia branch, L – Lepidoptera branch."
