"pone.0080824.g001.png","Phylogenetic tree of glypican genes from Danio rerio, Homo sapiens and Drosophila melanogastor.Phylogenetic comparison was carried out for glypicans genes sequences from zebrafish (Dr in black), humans and Drosophila (Hs and Dm in grey). The evolutionary tree was constructed using Neighbor-Joining method in the MEGA5.1 software using the Poisson model and partially deleted dataset. 500 bootstrap replications were used as a test of phylogeny and the values are indicated next to the branch. Branch length corresponds to evolutionary distances which denote the number of amino acid substitutions per site. Scale bar: 0.1"
