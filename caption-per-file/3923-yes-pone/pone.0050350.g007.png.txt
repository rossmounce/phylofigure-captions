The G722A exchange evolved 5 times during mammalian evolution.(A) Sequence alignment of residue 722 and surrounding amino acids of the PR LBD. (B) Phylogenetic tree of mammalian evolution deduced from Murphy et al. (16) and Killian et al. (17). Blue arrows indicate the substitution of G722 to alanine, green arrows the substitution to cysteine. (C) PR LBD DNA sequences from mammals listed in (B) were aligned and a codon analysis for positive/purifying selection performed based on phylogenetic relationships depicted in (B). Residues of elephant PR are color-coded according to their selective pressure during mammalian evolution."
