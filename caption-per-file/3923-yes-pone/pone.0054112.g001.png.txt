"pone.0054112.g001.png","Phylogenetic analysis of SCO2837 (GlxA) orthologs.Sequences were selected based on protein domain organisation conservation as predicted by CDART (A). Neighbour-Joining Bootstrap phylogenetic tree generated using protein sequences displaying similar domain composition and organisation to GlxA (B). Clades conformed by sequences from a single phylum or class and displaying high bootstrap value are condensed, and the number of sequences within the clade indicated next to phylum/class name. Numbers at branch nodes indicate bootstrap values. A tree showing un-condensed clades is provided as Figure S2."
