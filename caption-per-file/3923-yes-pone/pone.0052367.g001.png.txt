Figure 1. Phylogenetic tree of haplogroup H and T subsets.The phylogenetic tree was constructed according to phylotree.org [32]. aC16296T did not appear in the mtDNA sequence of cybrid T1. bBases of the Revised Cambridge Reference Sequence that appear in HEK T cybrids as polymorphisms diagnostic for non-H haplogroups (m.73A>G, m.2706A>G, m.7028C>T, m.11719G>A and m.14766C>T)."
