"pone.0078533.g001.png","A maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree on the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequences.The numbers at the nodes indicate bootstrap values (>500) based on 1000 replicates. Bar 0.1, 10 substitutions per 100 nucleotides. The Sb(III)/Cu(II)-resistant bacteria (including Sb(III)-oxidizing bacteria) were isolated using CDM medium as described in Material and Methods. ? represents the Sb(III)-oxidizing bacteria. The MIC values for Sb(III) and Cu(II), and the nucleotide accession numbers are shown after each strain's name."
