A global phylogenetic tree of tRNA molecules reconstructed from sequence and structure.MP analyses of data from 571 tRNA molecules resulted in the preset limit of 20,000 minimal length trees, each of 10,083 steps. Consistency index = 0.069 and 0.069, with and without uninformative characters, respectively; Retention index = 0.681; Rescaled consistency index = 0.047; g1 = −0.107. Terminal leaves are not labeled since they would not be legible. tRNA molecules coding for Sec, Ser, Tyr, and Leu are labeled with colors. Note several of these tRNAs have short variable arms and these are derived in the tree. Nodes labeled with closed circles have BS values >50%. The figure has been modified from [27] and a global tRNA tree with labeled terminal taxa can be found in Supporting Information (Figure S1)."
