"pone.0038207.g023.png","Time-calibrated phylogram of Lambeosaurinae based on the phylogenetic hypothesis shown in Fig. 22.The letters at each node indicate ancestral areas as inferred in the Dispersal-Vicariance analysis; a combination of two letters represents a widespread range of the ancestor in both of the areas indicated by each letter. The numbers to the left of the taxon names are the estimated ages in millions of years. When absolute age estimates are not available but only time ranges (e.g., middle-late Maastrichtian), the age of the taxon is approximated as the mid-point of a particular geochronological stage (numbers between brackets). The literature sources for each of the taxon's ages are as follows: Amurosaurus riabinini [42]; Aralosaurus tuberiferus [79], [80]; Charonosaurus jiayinensis [81]; Corythosaurus spp., Lambeosaurus spp., and Parasaurolophus walkeri [82]; Hypacrosaurus altispinus [43]; H. stebingeri [5]; Magnapaulia laticaudus [21]; Jaxartosaurus aralensis [83]; Olorotitan arharensis [37]; Pararhabdodon isonensis [84]; Parasaurolophus tubicen and P. cyrtocristatus [10]; Sahaliyania elunchunorum [40]; Tsintaosaurus spinorhinus [85]; and Velafrons coahuilensis [8]. Geochronological ages are from Gradstein et al. [86]."
