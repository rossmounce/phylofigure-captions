"pone.0037128.g005.png","Phylogeny of Gossypium species or races.The variable sequences were used to construct a phylogeny of Gossypium with Theobroma cacao as an outgroup. Bayesian phylogenetic analysis was performed using MrBayes program with GTR inv gamma model. The values at nodes represent Bayesian inference posterior probability. On the branch, the insertions (i) and deletions (d) of introns and genes (marked as *) are indicated by black and gray bars. The right tree shows the insertions (i) and deletions (d) of intergenic spacers happened on the branch from the node “\raster=""rg1""” to common branches of corresponding genome. Before and after “/” represents the number and length of indels, respectively."
