Synteny and gene-specific phylogenetic history of the two O-antigen specific gene clusters.The organismal phylogeny of the genus Listeria is shown in the upper panel (A), while the syntenic relationships of the two O-antigen gene clusters between the two major serotype divisions and the phylogenetic tree based on a representative serotype specific gene are shown in the two lower panels (B and C). Genes are colored by their phylogenetic histories: Serotype-specific genes (i.e., genes found only in specific serotypes) are colored green, while genes displaying an organismal phylogeny across the Listera genus are colored blue. Genes which follow a serotype-related phylogeny across Listeria are shown in orange. Values on the branches represent bootstrap values based on 100 bootstrap replicates. The organismal tree is based on a 10 locus multi-locus sequence analysis as described in Den Bakker et al. [52]. The topology of this tree is congruent with a tree based on the MLST scheme used in Ragon et al. [6]."
