"pone.0051785.g003.png","An unrooted phylogram of rOTUs from soil nematodes isolated from the flowerbed and agricultural field with predicted trophic types.Twenty-nine SSU rDNA barcode sequences of K01rOTUs (flowerbed samples) and H01rOTUs (agricultural field samples) were aligned for preparing a phylogenetic tree. The numbers of soil nematodes belonging to each rOTU correspond to the numbers of open (flowerbed samples) and closed (agricultural field samples) squares at the right. Numbers on nodes are bootstrap values (>50%). Trophic types indicated in the rOTUs were derived from those of the nematode species with the highest homology in SSU rDNA barcode sequences (Table 1), and the feeding types for the rOTUs containing a large number of nematode members are shown in boldface. Bar: 0.1 substitutions per site."
