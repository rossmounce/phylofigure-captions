"pone.0023206.g003.png","Phylogenetic analysis based on a 473-nucleotide region of the VP1 gene. This phylogenetic tree was constructed by the neighbor joining method using Kimura-two parameter model from MEGA4 software, with 1000 replicates. Thirty-seven sequences were compared to those strains reported from others countries in previous years available in GenBank. Only bootstrap values >70% are shown at the node. Geometric shapes indicate the years of the Brazilian isolates."
