"pone.0039752.g006.png","Chronophylomorphospace of Felidae.The transition of two-dimensional morphospace occupation through time can be visualised as a chronophylomorphospace plot. Positions in morphospace of ancestors were estimated using maximum likelihood and a composite phylogeny of Felidae with scaled branch lengths (Fig. 2). Two-dimensional coordinates of ancestors and terminals were then plotted against time as the third axis. Color-coded arrows point to the latest common ancestor of each lineage. The grey arrow points to the last common ancestor of Felinae. The drop-down shadow shows a planar projection of the chronophylomorphospace on the two-dimensional morphospace area delimited by the PC1 and PC2 axes. Numbers and colors are as in Fig. 2."
