Phylogenetic analysis of the novel Usutu virus (USUV) strain BH65/11-02-03 detected in a dead Blackbird from Mannheim in southwest Germany. The phylogenetic trees inferred with MrBayes are based on nucleotide sequences and of USUV strains: A (length: 11003 nucleotides, complete polyprotein gene) and B (length: 1327 nucleotides, partial polyprotein gene). For each sequence, the GenBank accession number, strain designation, and strain origin are provided. Posterior probabilities higher than 0.5 are shown on each node. Scale bar indicates genetic distance in nucleotide substitutions per site."
