"pone.0032938.g001.png","Phylogenetic tree of hexon proteins of HAdVs. The phylogenetic tree was inferred using the NJ method. The numbers in the tree show the distance between different sequences. The tree is drawn to scale with branch lengths (next to each branch) in the same units as those of the evolutionary distances used to infer the phylogenetic tree."
