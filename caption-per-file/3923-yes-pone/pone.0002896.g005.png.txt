"pone.0002896.g005.png","Maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree of zeaxanthin epoxidases and related proteins.A maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree (loglk = −48991.81356) as inferred from zeaxanthin epoxidases and related protein amino acid sequences (312 amino acid positions). The tree was computed using WAG model for amino acid substitution (selected by PROTTEST) with discrete gamma distribution in four categories. All parameters (gamma shape = 1.760; proportion of invariants = 0.010) were estimated from the dataset. Numbers above branches indicate ML/NJ bootstrap supports. NJ tree was inferred using AsaturA program with cutoff value 0.908 and 1000 replicates. Black stars indicate both bootstraps over 90%. The original annotation of ZEP related proteins is indicated. Nodes that display different NJ topology than the one obtained by ML, are indicated by “dt”."
