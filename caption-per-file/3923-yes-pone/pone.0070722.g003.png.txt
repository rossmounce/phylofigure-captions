"pone.0070722.g003.png","Phylogenetic analysis of selected poleroviruses based on the following proteins: (A) CP (ORF3), (B) the N-terminus of the RTD (ORF5, first 233aa) (C) the C-terminus of the RTD (ORF5, last 262aa) of Potato leaf curl virus [PLRV (Y07496)], Tobacco vein-distorting virus [TVDV (EF529624)], Cucurbit aphid-borne yellows virus [CABYV (X76931)], Pepper vein yellows virus [PeVYV (AB5948280)], Pepper yellow leaf curl virus [PYLCV (HM439608)], and Pepper yellows virus [(PepYV) FN600344].Each protein-coding sequence was aligned using the MUSCLE program and phylogenetic trees were then constructed for each data set using the PhyML software with 100 bootstrap replicates and PLRV, the type member of the genus Polerovirus, as an out-group. The sequence of PepYV ORF 5 is not available and was not used for the construction of the phylogenetic trees described in B."
