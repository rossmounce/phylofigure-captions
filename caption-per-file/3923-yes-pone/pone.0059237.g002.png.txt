"pone.0059237.g002.png","Maximum-parsimony tree constructed from the concatenated sequences of seven nuclear genes (chs2-drk1-fads-pyrF-tub1-arf6-its2).A majority consensus mid-point rooted maximum parsimony (MP) tree was constructed based on the concatenated sequence of seven MLST gene loci. The MP tree is displayed without logarithmic scaling so that genetic distance and geographic region of isolation could be viewed. Values along branches represent maximum parsimony bootstrap values (MPB) and Bayesian posterior probability (BPP) values respectively. Values for branches partitioning less than three isolates or those with MPB ?70 and BPP?0.95 are not shown. The tree is displayed with pattern coding for geographic regions as described in Figure 1. The MP tree displays a partition in the current species B. dermatitidis into two phylogenetic species: B. dermatitidis (PS1, clade 1) and B. gilchristii (PS2, clade 2)."
