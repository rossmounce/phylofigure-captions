"pone.0033579.g001.png","Maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree based on 3,081 HIV-1 subtype C pol sequences. Maximum likelihood (PhyML) phylogenetic tree based on 1,011 nucleotide sites of pol gene sequence (nucleotides 2,253â€“3,263 of HXB2 coordinates) from 3,081 HIV-1 subtype C isolates. Sequences were isolated in the countries shown in Table 2. Sequences are colored to their region of origin: Senegal in red, Southern African countries (South-Africa, Botswana, Malawi, Mozambique, Swaziland, Zambia and Zimbabwe) in orange, other African countries (mainly from the East) in yellow, North and South America in purple, Asia in green and Europe in blue. The branch support (aLRT) of clade A, B, C and MSM are of 73%, 76%, 82% and 99% respectively."
