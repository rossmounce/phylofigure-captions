"pone.0040784.g004.png","Neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree based on 16S rRNA gene sequences (ca. 1.44 kb) of the Methylobacterium isolates (black) and Methylobacterium type strains (red).Sequence alignment was carried out by SILVA Aligner [37] and analyzed with Kimuraâ€™s two-parameter algorithm (MEGA5) [38]. Tentative identifications by the EZtaxon site for the isolates are shown with pairwise similarity. Numbers at nodes are bootstrap percentages (based on 1000 resampled data sets); only values above 70% are shown. The sequence of Rhodopseudomonas palustris DSM123T (AB175650) was used as an outgroup. Note that strains 23e and 35a were previously identified as novel species (M. gnaphalii 23e(T) and M. oxalidis 35a(T), respectively). Bar: 0.01 substitutions per nucleotide position."
