Diatom membrane transporters of putative algal origin. The phylogenies shown are of (A) a green algal derived zinc/cadmium/cobalt transporter, (B) a red algal derived high affinity nitrate transporter, and (C) a red and green algal derived potassium efflux antiporter. In all trees node values represent RAxML bootstrap support for 100 subsamples. Prokaryotes are highlighted in yellow, Stramenopiles in brown, and Cryptophyta in blue. The Plantae lineages, Rhodophyta and Viridiplantae are highlighted in red and green, respectively. Diatom species are shown in boldface. Only bootstrap values â‰¥50% are shown. The unit of branch length is the number of substitutions per site."
