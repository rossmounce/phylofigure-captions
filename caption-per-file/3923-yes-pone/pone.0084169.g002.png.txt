Maximum Likelihood phylogenetic tree of 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequences from the Mary Rose biofilm enrichment cultures BF4-low pH and BF4-PEG with related outgroup taxa.Substitution pattern and rates were estimated under the General Time Reversible model (+G), where gamma distribution is estimated at 0.3005. The nucleotide frequencies are A?=?20.34%, T/U?=?24.84%, C?=?32.08%, and G?=?22.74%. For estimating ML values, a user-specified topology was used. The maximum Log likelihood for this computation was -6907.774. The analysis involved 42 nucleotide sequences. All positions containing gaps and missing data were eliminated. There were a total of 978 positions in the final dataset. Evolutionary analyses were conducted in MEGA5 [2]. Pie charts display bacterial diversity of Mary Rose biofilm enriched in minimal media at pH 1.7 (BF4-pH 1.7) and BF4-PEG-pH 3.0 enrichment culture with 75% PEG 200."
