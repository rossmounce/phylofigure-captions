Bayesian tree of the concatenated data set showing phylogenetic relationships among 21 Athalia species from Europe, Africa and Japan.Numbers represent posterior probabilities obtained for the complete data set/posterior probabilities obtained after excluding the shorter COI sequences/bootstrap values of the maximum parsimony analysis. Values below .80/.80/80 are not shown. Outgroup taxa are not shown. The identity of A. ahngeri is uncertain. Flower symbols indicate host family associations according to Table 1. Note that we only include Lamiales as hosts for A. circularis, because they did not fully develop on any other host plant family except Plantaginaceae in our assays. Similarly, only Brassicaceae were included for A. rosae rosae. Potential host shifts hypothesized by the MPR (circles) and ML (squares) analyses are represented in the case of an ancestral association with Brassicaceae (black left-side) or Lamiales (black right-side). The figure was edited with MrEnt v.2.2TM."
