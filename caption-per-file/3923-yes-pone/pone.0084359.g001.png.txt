"pone.0084359.g001.png","Sequence alignment of TaNAC67 and NACs in various plant species.A. Amino acid alignment of TaNAC67 and other NAC family members from selected plant species. The numbers on the left indicate amino acid position. Shared amino acid residues are in black background. Gaps, indicated by dashed lines are introduced for optimal alignment. The region underlined indicates the conserved NAC-domain. ?, conserved amino acid motif (AA sequences in red rectangles). Alignments were performed using the Megalign program of DNAStar. B. Phylogenetic tree of TaNAC67 and NAC members from other plant species. Abbreviations: At, Arabidopsis thaliana; Bd, Brachypodium distachyon; Eg, Elaeis guineensis; Gm, Glycine max; Hv, Hordeum vulgare; Os, Oryza sativa; Sb, Sorghum bicolor; Sl, Solanum lycopersicum; Vv, Vitis vinifera; Zm, Zea mays. The phylogenetic tree was constructed with the PHYLIP 3.69 package, and the bootstrap values are in percent."
