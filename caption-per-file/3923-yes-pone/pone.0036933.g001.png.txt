Phylogenetic subtree 2.The phylogenetic relationships between taxa in the subtree were reconstructed in BEAST for subsequent analysis in BaTS. For graphic visualization, a maximum clade credibility tree was generated in TreeAnnotator and annotated in FigTree. Taxa are colored by ethnicity: Aboriginal (Ab, green), African-Caribbean (AC, orange), Asian (As, pink), Caucasian (Ca, blue), Latin-American (LA, red)."
