Maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees based on a set of 222 sequences (four NK2 and 218 DLX sequences) aligned using different multiple alignment algorithms.A) M-Coffee [15]; B) Muscle [16]; C) T-coffee [4]. As suggested by Notredame et al. ([4]), only amino acid aligned positions without gaps and with a score greater than 3 were used. Numbers are the number of times a given cluster is obtained out of 500 replicates. Blue – NK2 gene sequences; Red – Non-bilaterian species; Plum – Mammals; Light orange – Aves; Green – Teleostei fish; Gray 50% - Urochordata; Teal – Protostomes; Gold – Reptiles; Brown – Elasmobranchii; Light green – Hemichordata; Turquoise – Cephalocordata; Pink – Amphibians; Lavender – Hyperoartia. Arrows point to sequences that do not show the region where the characteristic DLX amino acids are located."
