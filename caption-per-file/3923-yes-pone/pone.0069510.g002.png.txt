The phylogenetic relationship of MKK3 among different species.Maximum Likelihood (ML) tree was constructed based on the complete amino acid sequences of MKK3 from Amphibalanus amphitrite and other species. A. amphitrite p38MAPK sequence was chosen as the outgroup. Support for each node was tested with standard bootstrap analysis using 1,000 replications. The Genbank access number for each species was labeled with the species name."
