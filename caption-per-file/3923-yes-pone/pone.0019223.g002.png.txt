"pone.0019223.g002.png","Phylogeny and relative composition of the sequenced nifH assemblages. Neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree of 92% similarity clustered nifH sequences (79 090) and nearest relatives from ten sampling locations. The relative number of sequences in each cluster is shown in a heatmap with the median value of the dataset indicated in dark blue and the highest value in pink. White indicates that there are no sequences from the cluster present in the sample. Bootstrap values (500 replicates) >50% are indicated with grey circles proportional to the size of the bootstrap value. Accession numbers of reference sequences, sequence codes for each cluster and the absolute number of sequences for each sample are shown in Figure S4."
