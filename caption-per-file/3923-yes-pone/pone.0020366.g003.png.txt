The Chilli leaf curl betasatellite detected in cotton is distinct from the majority of ChLCB detected in other plant species. Neigbour-joining phylogenetic dendrogram based upon an alignment of all full-length nucleotide sequences of ChLCuB available in databases with that isolated from cotton in Sindh (NGVB). In each case the database accession number is given. The numbers at nodes represent percentage bootstrap confidence scores (1000 replicates). The alignment was arbitrarily rooted on outgroup, the sequence of Tomato yellow leaf curl Thailand alphasatellite (TYLCTHA), an unrelated molecule of a similar size. The plant species from which betasatellites were isolated and their geographical origins are indicated. The northern (N) and southern (S) “strains” of ChLCB identified by Hussain et al. [34] are indicated."
