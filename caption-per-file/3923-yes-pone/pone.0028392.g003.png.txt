"pone.0028392.g003.png","Phylogenetic relatedness of CqJHE and JHE sequences from six insect orders. The phylogenetic analysis was performed using MEGA version 5.05 [49]. The tree was generated by the Neighbor-Joining method using a ClustalW generated alignment of 14 JHE or putative JHE sequences. The percentage of replicate trees in which the sequences clustered together in the bootstrap analysis (1000 replicates) is shown at the branch nodes. The tree is drawn to scale, with branch lengths in the same units as those of the evolutionary distances (computed using the Poisson correction method) used to infer the phylogenetic tree. The double dagger (‡) and dagger (†) indicate proteins that show a specificity constant (kcat/KM) for JH III that is greater than or less than 106 M−1 s−1, respectively. The asterisk (*) indicates that the specificity constant of the protein is uncharacterized. The insect order, GenBank accession number, and key reference of the sequences are as follows. Diptera: CqJHE (JN251105), AaJHE (EAT43357) [23], DmJHE (AF304352) [24]; Orthoptera: GaJHE (EF558769) [31]; Coleoptera: PhJHE (AB259898) [50], TmJHE (AF448479) [51], TcJHE (NP_001180223) [30]; Lepidoptera: CfJHE (AF153367) [52], HvJHE (AF037197) [53], HaJHE (FJ997319) [54], MsJHE (AF327882) [55], BmJHE (AF287267) [56]; Hymenoptera: AmJHE (AY647436) [57]; and Hemiptera: NlJHE (EU380769) [58]."
