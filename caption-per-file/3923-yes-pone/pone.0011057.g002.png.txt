Bayesian coalescence phylogeny of influenza A(H1N1)pdm full-genome sequences from the world.The branch length of the phylogeny is in units of time. The scale bar indicating 30 days of the branch length is drawn at the bottom of the tree. The clusters described in the previous report [12] are annotated by brackets on the right of the tree. The sequences from Japan are colored with red. The sequences from Central-East Asia except for Japan, South-East Asia, Europe, New York, and Central-North America except for New York are colored with orange, yellow, purple, blue and green, respectively. Shadows on the terminal lineages show Japanese micro-clades. Date with arrows pointing out a node of the tree shows tMRCA of the monophyletic group. MC represents micro-clade."
