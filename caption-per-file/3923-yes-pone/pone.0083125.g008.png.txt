"pone.0083125.g008.png","Neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree of Acetobacteraceae (Alpha 2.2).Tree based on 1024 positions of the 16S-rDNA bacterial sequence from a variety of A. mellifera associated microenvironments. Sampled niche is mapped to the right of each sequence label (see color key). All mapped sequences are unique according to at least one of the following: sampled niche, culture media, or DNA sequence. Abbreviated taxon labels begin with a letter designating clones downloaded from GenBank (C), clones produced from different colonies (libraries) in this study (C1?=?19, C2?=?20), or isolates (I). Isolates from this study are labeled according to growth media. Isolates from larval guts are according to [82]. Numbers following LV designate the stage of larval instar."
