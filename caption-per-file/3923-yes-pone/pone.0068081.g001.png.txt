"pone.0068081.g001.png","Phylogenetic analysis of field HRVs of ARINET and SLRI based on the VP4/VP2 and the 5â€² NCR sequences.The phylogenetic trees were constructed using the Neighbor-Joining method in the program MEGA 4 and HEV-D 68 (accession no. AY426531) was designated as outgroup [35]. The distances of trees were computed using the Maximum Composite Likelihood method [42], and the units are the number of base substitutions per site. The intraspecies recombination strains of HRV-A, interspecies recombination strains of HRV-A, intraspecies recombination strains of HRV-C and interspecies recombination strains of HRV-C are labeled using white circles, black circles, white squares and black squares, respectively."
