"pone.0053029.g004.png","Phylogenetic inference of Actinobacteria 16S rRNA genes.The modified ARB database generated by Simister et al., [34] used long sequences (?1200 bp) to infer the phylogeny and shorter sequences were added using the ARB parsimony interactive tool. Sequences from the sponge-specific cluster 22 (SC22) [34] along with sequences closely related to band 1 and outgroup sequences were selected for further phylogenetic analysis. The Maximum Likelihood tree (-ln likelihood: 4501,317092) is shown, with sequences retrieved in this study highlighted in bold. Numbers at tree nodes are bootstrap values and posterior probabilities calculated in Maximum Likelihood and MCMC Bayesian analyses, respectively, and values above 70/0.95 are shown."
