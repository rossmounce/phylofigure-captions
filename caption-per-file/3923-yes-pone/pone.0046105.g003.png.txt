Bayesian estimate of phylogenetic relationships amongst the species and subgenera of the crayfish genus Cambarus with outgroups from other genera within the family Cambaridae.Taxa labels are followed by the US state the sample was collected in, the type of habitat of each species in parenthesis (c = cave, b = burrow, s = stream), and in some cases a number for species with more than one sampled individual. Nodal support is indicated by Bayesian posterior probabilities before the slash and ML bootstrap values after the slash on branches leading to the supported node."
