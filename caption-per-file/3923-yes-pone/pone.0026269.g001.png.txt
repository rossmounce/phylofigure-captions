"pone.0026269.g001.png","Phylogenetic relationships among primates estimated from cytochrome c sequence. The same phylogenetic tree was obtained using (separately) maximum likelihood, maximum parsimony and Bayesian approaches. Divergence times were estimated by the Bayesian local molecular clock approach. Only non-synonymous mutation events of internal branches are shown."
