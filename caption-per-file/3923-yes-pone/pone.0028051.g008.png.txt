Summary of piwi expressions in the pea aphid. Integration of phylogenetic, semi-quantitative RT-PCR and in situ hybridisation analyses on the expanded piwi genes of the pea aphid. A: NJ tree of Api-piwi genes; boostrap values are indicated. B: Expression level of Api-piwi genes measured by semi-quantitative RT-PCR on the four reproductive morphs: female virginoparae (Vp), female sexuparae (Sxp), female oviparae (Ovp) and males (M) (see Figure 2 and Figure S1). Expression level was represented by “+”.C: Germline/soma expressions of Api-piwi genes during embryogenesis (see Figures 3–6 and Figure S2). Expressions of Api-piwi1,4,7 and Api-piwi8 were not determined (ND) in sexuparous and oviparous embryos. Localisation of transcripts was not determined in males since in situ techniques have not been applicable to this morph yet. Abbreviation: Dev., development."
