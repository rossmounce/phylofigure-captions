Large-scale loci comparisons across ferns. The x and y axes depict the p-distances calculated for each species pair within each fern order (Psilotales and Ophioglossales are combined here into class Psilotopsida). All loci comparisons are presented as y-axis vs x-axis: (A) matK vs rbcL, (B) matK vs trnH-psbA, (C) rbcL vs trnH-psbA, (D) matK vs trnL-F, (E) rbcL vs trnL-F, (F) trnL-F vs trnH-psbA. The lines in each panel (labeled with the ratios 1∶1, 1∶2, 1∶4, 4∶1 or 2∶1) are not regression lines, but are drawn to guide the eye in interpreting the results. (G) Phylogenetic relationships among fern orders, taxonomic symbols, and number of species compared per order for each locus (matK, rbcL, trnH-psbA, trnL-F, respectively). The arrow on the phylogenetic topology points to the branch where the trnH-psbA region of the plastid genome is predicted to have been translocated to the inverted repeat region [38]. The arrowheads point to the locations of trnH-psbA in the plastid genome."
