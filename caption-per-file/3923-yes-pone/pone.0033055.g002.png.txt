Maximum likelihood phylogeny of Malus genes encoding enzymes and transporters involved in sugar metabolism and accumulation with those from Arabidopsis or Lycopersicon esculentum. The tree was produced using MUSCLE and PhyML with the JTT amino acid substitution model, a discrete gamma model with 4 categories and an estimated shape parameter of 1.0. Bootstrapping was performed with 100 replicates. A, cell wall invertase (CWINV); B, neutral invertases (NINV), α and β type NINV according to Nonis et al. [37]; C, vacuolar acid invertase (vAINV); D; sucrose synthase (SUSY), different types according to Bieniawska et al. [38]; E, fructokinase (FK), cytosolic and plastid fructokinases in tomato according to Granot [19]; F, hexokinase (HK), different groups according to Karve et al. [39]; G, Sucrose phosphate synthases (SPS), Arabidopsis types according to Lutfiyya et al. [40]; H, Sucrose transporter (SUT), different groups according to Braun & Slewinski [41]; I, tonoplast monosaccharide transporter (TMT); J, vacuolar glucose transporter (vGT)."
