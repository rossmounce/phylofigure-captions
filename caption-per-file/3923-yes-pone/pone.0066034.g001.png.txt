Mapping of the mitochondrial phylogeny of I. monticola on the geographical distribution of the species.Localization of the samples and mitochondrial haplotypes of I. monticola at the NW of the Iberian Peninsula. B) Mapping on this geographical distribution of the Bayesian phylogenetic tree of the mitochondrial sequences. A geological time scale in millions of years is shown below. Abbreviations: L1? Lambre; L2? Mandeo; L3? Serra da Capelada; L4? Eume; L5? Sobrado; L6? Serra da Queixa; L7? Serra do Xistral; L8? Serra dos Ancares; L9? Serra do Courel; L10? Montes do Pindo; L11? Serra da Estrela; L12? Somiedo; L13? Leitariegos; L14? Ubi?a; L15? Vegarada; L16? Pe?a Prieta; L17? Sierra de Gistredo. Limits and corresponding nouns of the main administrative divisions of the study area are indicated on the map. Labels marking the extent and situation of the main river basin (Minho-Sil) and the two main mountain systems (Cantabrian Mountain Range and Macizo Galaico-Leon?s) of this area are also placed on the map. Numbers from 1 to 23 denote mitochondrial haplotypes, as in Figure 2. The tree is rooted using I. cyreni (see Fig. S1). Range between min and max posterior probability values (0.53?1.0) is indicated by color and width gradients (blue to red, and slim to thick). Support values obtained by four different methods of analysis for the major clades of I. monticola (II, III, IV-V, and VI) are shown at each node; namely, from left to right, Bayes posterior probability (?100), ML best trees in consensus (%), NJ-bootstrap (%), and equally MP trees (%). A hyphen was inserted instead of a numerical value whenever a particular method did not support the Bayesian topology."
