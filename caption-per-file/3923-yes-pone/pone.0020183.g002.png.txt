"pone.0020183.g002.png","HPV31variant tree topologies andpairwise comparisons of individual complete genomes. Bayesian trees were inferred from global alignment of complete genome nucleotide sequences (the other HPV16-related HPV reference prototypes were set as the outgroup). Numbers on or near branches indicate support indices in the following order: Bayesian credibility value using MrBayes v3.1.2 [48], maximum parsimony (MP) bootstrap percentage and neighbor joining (NJ) bootstrap percentage using PAUP* v4.0b10 [50]. An asterisk (*) indicates 100% agreement between methods. “NA” reflects disagreement between a method and the reference Bayesian tree at a given node. Thus, one tree is shown, but three different methods of tree construction were used to estimate the support of the provided tree, as explained above. Distinct variant lineages (i.e., termed A, B, and C) are classified according to the topology and nucleotide sequence differences from >1% to "
