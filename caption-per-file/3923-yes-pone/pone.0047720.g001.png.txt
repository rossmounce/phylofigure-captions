Genomic organization and distribution of sdiA in the Enterobacteriaceae.a) Distribution of sdiA on a phylogenetic tree based on 16S rDNA sequences. Only bootstrap values of ?50 are displayed. Blue lines indicate species that contain a solo sdiA. Green lines indicate species that contain sdiA and an adjacent luxI homolog. A maximum likelihood tree gave similar results (not shown). b) Map of the sdiA region in representative organisms that encode SdiA orthologs. Any additional LuxR/LuxI pairs in those organisms are also listed. Genes depicted in white are conserved in all genera and genes in gray are not conserved. sdiA is represented in black and sirA in gray hatched lines."
