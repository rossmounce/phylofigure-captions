Amino acid sequence and phylogenic tree of bHLH proteins.(A) Sequence alignment of SlGL3 (Solyc08g081140.2.1), GL3 (AF246291) and EGL3 (NM20235). Shaded letters indicate identical residues. bHLH regions are indicated as line above the sequences. (B) Phylogenic tree based on deduced amino acid sequences of bHLH proteins [SlGL3, GL3, EGL3, TT8 (AJ277509), AtMYC1 (AF251697), AtbHLH003 (AF251688), AtbHLH004 (AF251689), AtbHLH005 (AF251690), AtbHLH006 (X99548), AtbHLH013 (AY120752), AtbHLH014 (AJ619812), AtbHLH017 (AY094399), AtbHLH018 (AF488562), AtbHLH025 (AF488567) and AtbHLH028 (AF252636)] aligned with a multiple alignment program (Genetyx ver. 16.0.2 software, Genetyx, Tokyo, Japan). The dendrogram was created using clustering with the Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic Mean (UPGMA). Branch length indicates relative evolutionary distances. Numbers above branches are genetic distances based on 10,000 bootstrap replicates. Distances are shown as the p-distance. Subdivision groups of Arabidopsis bHLH proteins (Group IIId, IIIe, IIIf and IVa) are shown to the right of the gene names."
