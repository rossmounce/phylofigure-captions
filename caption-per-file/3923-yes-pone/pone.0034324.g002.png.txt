Integrase phylogeny.A maximum likelihood tree for 459 non-recombinant integrase sequences from Brazil (145 generated by us and 314 from other studies) inferred with GARLI v0.95. Thick branches indicate lineages known to be recombinants on other regions of their genomes. The tree was midpoint rooted, which agrees precisely with the known relationship among HIV-1 group M subtypes [34]. Subtype C sequences are collapsed for clarity. This tree shows a large number of potential independent origination events of BF recombinants."
