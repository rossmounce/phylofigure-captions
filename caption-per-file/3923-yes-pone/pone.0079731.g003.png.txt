Primate D0 Ig-like domain phylogenetic tree.The tree was constructed from DNA sequences encoding the D0 Ig-like domain using the ML method based on the K2 [39] G model. Primate KIR lineages are indicated by roman numerals. The Aotus KIR lineages (VI) are shown with a blue background and the other primate lineages (I, II, III, IV and V) are depicted with a red background. Numbers on branches represent bootstrap percentages after 1,000 replicates. Human allele sequences have no prefix; GORGO, Gorillagorilla; PANTR, Pantroglodytes; PONPY, Pongopygmaeus; MACMU, Macacamulatta; Om, Aotus sp and AOTVO, A. vociferans. Branches in red represent Cercopithecidae KIR, green Hominidea KIR and blue branches combine Platyrrhini KIR."
