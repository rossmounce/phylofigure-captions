Phylogenetic analysis identifies major families of functional domains.Sequences corresponding to the passenger domain plus α−linker-domain of autotransporters were defined and subject to phylogenetic analysis (Methods). Sub-domain signatures were identified using Pfam analysis of all sequences, and these are represented as radiating coloured symbols. The length of this line is proportional to the number of residues in the passenger-α-linker-domains. Major functional categories are shown (light blue arcs) based on the conservation of Pfam signatures and phylogenetic clustering. Non-proteobacterial sequences are coloured green (Chlamydiales) and yellow (Fusobacteria). Figure S2 provides the tree in a form where the accession numbers of every sequence can be viewed."
