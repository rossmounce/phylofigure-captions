"pone.0061635.g001.png","Maximum likelihood phylogenetic analysis of Pgp protein sequences from nematodes.Protein sequences were aligned using ClustalX2 under default conditions. Optimal amino acid substitution models were determined using Prottest 3.0 before calculating the most likely tree topology using PhyML3.0.1. The substitution model LG was used and PhyML was set to optimize the number of invariant sites, the amino acid frequencies and the ? shape parameter for modelling the distribution of the amino acid substitution rate categories which were set to eight. Both results of the approximate likelihood ratio test modified according to Shimodaira and Hasegawa (before the slash) and of a Bayesian-like transformation of the approximate likelihood ratio test (after the slash) are shown as branch supports. As outgroup, Pgp sequences from mouse (Mmu), Drosophila melanogaster (Dme), Pediculus humanus corporis (Phu), Schistosoma mansoni (Sma) were used. The complete Pgp protein families of Caenorhabditis elegans (Cel) and Caenorhabditis briggsae (Cbr) were included. In addition, available annotated Pgp sequences of Pristionchus pacificus (Ppa) and of the parasites Ascaris suum (Asu), Brugia malayi (Bma), Haemonchus contortus (Hco) and Onchocerca volvolus (Ovo) were used for alignment. Pgp, P-glycoprotein; MDR, multi-drug resistance protein. The scale bar represents the indicated number of substitutions per site. Accession numbers for protein sequences in the tree are provided in Table S5."
