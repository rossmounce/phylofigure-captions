Maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree of Listeria monocytogenes strains based on MLST loci.L. monocytogenes sequence types are indicated (?ST?); ?CC? denotes clonal complexes. The tree is based on concatenated full-length MLST gene sequences and was calculated with MEGA 5 [27] using the Tamura-Nei model. Bootstrap values (500? resampling) are indicated at the respective nodes."
