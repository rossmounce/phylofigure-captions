The sub-subgroups of EFG II including the G2 motif patterns. The phylogenetic tree shown in figure 3 was used and sequences of the same sub-subgroups were compressed and are shown as triangles. Triangle height corresponds to evolutionary distance and triangle base corresponds to the number of compressed sequences involved. The sequence logos at the right of the figure represent the nine EFG II sub-subgroup-specific G2 motif patterns. The broken lines connect the G2 motif patterns with the corresponding EFG II sub-subgroups. EFG I from Thermus thermophilus was used as an outg-roup. Scale bar shows changes per position, estimated by MrBayes."
