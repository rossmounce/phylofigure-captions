Unrooted phylogeny of PCNA based on Bayesian analysis of 40 sequences of 178 Dayhoff-recoded amino acid positions performed with p4 with an additional base composition vector. Detailed parameters are given in the Materials and Methods section. The NCLDV sequences (red) and metagenomic sequences (black) emerge as a single group from within the eukaryotes (with the exception of the Emiliana huxleyi virus). Archaeal sequences are in green. The indicated branch support values are posterior probabilities, and the bar represents 0.3 substitutions per site."
