Phylogenetic tree and protein domains of Nme8 in Metazoans. A. The phylogenetic midpoint-rooted tree was constructed as described in Figure 1A. B. Corresponding protein domain structure was obtained as described in Figure 2A. C. Synteny analysis between Nematostella vectensis Nme8 genes and human TXNDC3 (NME8) genes. Nematostella vectensis gene names correspond to the NCBI Entrez Gene identification. For clarity reasons the unchanged part “NEMVEDRAFT_” was removed."
