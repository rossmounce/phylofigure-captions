Comparison of Hox expression patterns among cnidarian species.Each expression pattern is represented by a red shading on the planula, polyp or medusa diagrams. The diagrams illustrate a schematic view of each stage after theoretical longitudinal section to expose the ectodermal layer (dark gray) and the endodermal layer (light gray) separated by the mesoglea (black line). All published expression data for cnidarian species were mapped on the ML phylogenetic tree. Branches for bilaterian sequences were compressed to simplify the figure. Black disks indicate statistically supported nodes."
