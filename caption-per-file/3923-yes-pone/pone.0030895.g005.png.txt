Conservation and P-Match scores of the YY1 site in the 57 bp fragment of primate CYP3A promoters. The 5′-VKHCATNWB-3′ consensus for YY1 is depicted on the top of sequences in the IUB code. Nucleotides identical to the equivalence consensus are denoted by dots. The arrow indicates the T>C mutation in the YY1 core motif. The phylogenetic tree of selected primate CYP3A genes on the left was adopted from a previous study [68]. “CYP” has been removed from gene names to improve legibility."
