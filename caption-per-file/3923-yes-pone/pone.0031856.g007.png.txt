"pone.0031856.g007.png","Bayesian phylogenetic tree of fungal and bacterial T1 globins. Bayesian tree based on a T-COFFEE 9.01 alignment of 2 fungal (red and black arrows), 70 bacterial (blue), 4 euryarchaeote (purple) and 10 chlorophyte (green) T1 globins, using 2 Physcomitrella nsHbs as outgroup. Support values at branches represent Bayesian posterior probabilities (>0.5). All the bacterial FHbs are in the blue boxes. The sequences are identified by the first three letters of the binary species name, the number of residues, and the full phylum and family names (see Table S1)."
