Neighbour-Joining dendogram and PCR results. The Neighbour-Joining dendogram of the concatenated 16S rRNA and recA gene sequences is displayed in conjunction with the PCR results and the percent DNA similarity (compared to H. influenzae 86-028NP). The tree is rooted by H. parainfluenzae as indicated by the yellow dots. The blue dots represent the strict NTHi group, the orange dots represent closely related phylogenetic variants, the red dots represent likely Hh isolates and the green dots represent variants related to H. parainfluenzae. Study-defined NTHi was based collectively on the phylogeny, PCR data and DNA similarity as is indicated on the right (✓ = NTHi or ✗ = Hh)."
