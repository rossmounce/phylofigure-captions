"pone.0081864.g002.png","Maximum likelihood (ML) phylogenetic trees of mammalian MDA5 gene used for codon-based ML analysis.When testing mammalian MDA5 alignment for recombination, one significant breakpoint was detected at nucleotide position 903. (A) A phylogenetic tree was reconstructed for the first 903 nucleotides under the nucleotide substitution model TIM3+G. (B) A second ML tree was inferred for the remaining 2211 nucleotides and under the nucleotide substitution model TIM3+I+G. (C) A tree was also reconstructed for MDA5 total alignment without recombination testing and under the nucleotide substitution model GTR+G. Bootstrap values >50 are indicated on the branches."
