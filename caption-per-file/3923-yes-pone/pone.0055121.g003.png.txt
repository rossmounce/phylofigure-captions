Phylogenetic analyses of specific genes of ILTV.Maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees were generated using alignments of nucleotide sequences of the UL27 (A), ICP4 (B), UL47 (C) and US4 (D) genes obtained from the NCBI sequence database. One hundred bootstrap replicates were used to assess the significance of the tree topologies and the number of replicate trees containing each specific branch in the consensus tree is shown next to that branch. Pink text indicates Australian field isolates and green text indicates USA backyard flock strains of ILTV. The Serva vaccine strain is indicated in red text and the Australian origin vaccine SA2 and A20 strains in blue text. vac, vaccine; EU, Europe; USA, United States of America; Aus, Australia; Chi, China; Ita, Italy."
