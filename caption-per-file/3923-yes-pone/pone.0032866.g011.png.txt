Two-Locus (duplexed) Melt-MAMA development. (A) A phylogenetic topology of the three subspecies of F. tularensis rooted with F. novicida. The SNP-signatures specific for the two pathogenic subspecies of F. tularensis (indicated by black bars) were incorporated into Melt-MAMAs. The table (right) indicates expected allele states (derived and ancestral) for strains from each F. tularensis subspecies represented on the topology; F. novicida would have the same allelic states as F. tularensis subsp. mediasiatica. (Biâ€“iv) Temperature-dissociation (melt) curves (derivative) of allele-specific PCR products from F. tularensis strains amplified in the duplexed assay (Type A and Type B). Each profile show two melt-curve peaks generated from a single F. tularensis strain. Each peak corresponds to the allele-specific PCR product for a single SNP-locus in the duplexed assay."
