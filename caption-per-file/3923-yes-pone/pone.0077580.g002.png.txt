Phylogenetic reconstruction of aldh1a and rar sequences.Phylogenetic analysis of chordate aldh1a enzymes (A) and retinoic acid receptors (B) using PhyML (upper values) and MrBayes (lower values). For the analysis the coding regions of aldh1a and rar cDNAs were used. The position of the X. hellerii orthologs of aldh1a2, rar-ga and rar-gb within the two phylogenies is highlighted (grey box)."
