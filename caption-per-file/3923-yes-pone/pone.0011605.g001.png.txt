Maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree of known and putative Î±-isopropylmalate synthase proteins.Predicted amino acid sequences were downloaded from GenBank, with gi numbers provided after each species in grey, with the exception of Phycomyces which was sequenced during this study, and the R. oryzae and S. punctatus sequences from the Broad Institute, and M. circinelloides and S. roseus from the Joint Genome Institute. The amino acid sequences for B. emersonii and C. elegans are partial, being derived from expressed sequence tags. Bootstrap values (100 replicates) above 70% are shown."
