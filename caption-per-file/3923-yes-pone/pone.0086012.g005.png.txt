"pone.0086012.g005.png","Bayesian phylogeny of GSTs from T. castaneum, and D. melanogaster genomic and L. decemlineata transcriptomic sequences.The tree was based on the WAG G+I protein model and run for 9,248,000 generations. Posterior probability values are marked at the nodes. Sequences are named by a prefix of three letters indicating the species (Dme – D. melanogaster, Tca – T. castaneum, Lde – L. decemlineata) followed by either the accession ids and name in NCBI (for Dme and Tca) or contig name (for Ld). A GST from N. vectensis (Nve) was used as outgroup."
