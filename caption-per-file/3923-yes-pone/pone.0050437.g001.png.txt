Hypothesis of demosponge relationships based on maximum likelihood analysis of seven nuclear housekeeping genes.Topology rooted on three cnidarians and the placozoan Trichoplax. Bootstrap indices (400 replicates) are shown at each node, with those exceeding 70 in bold. New taxa added as part of the PorToL project are indicated in bold; new taxa added from EST/genomics projects are indicated with a single asterisk; and taxa with new identifications after examination of the voucher specimen are marked with two asterisks. Clade names in italics followed by a superscript p have been phylogenetically defined in other studies (see text)."
