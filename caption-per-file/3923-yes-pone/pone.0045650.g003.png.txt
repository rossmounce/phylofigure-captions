"pone.0045650.g003.png","Alignment and phylogenetic analysis of vitamin D receptors (VDRs).(A) Alignment of amino-acid sequences of zebrafish (z)VDRa and VDRb. (B) Phylogenetic analysis of vertebrate VDRs. The consensus line denotes a consensus (asterisk), similarity (: or.), or difference (-) between zVDRa and zVDRb. Bold letters indicate the DNA-binding domain, and underlined letters indicate the ligand-binding domain. Phylogenetic analyses were conducted using MEGA5. The phylogenetic analyses were inferred using Neighbor-joining trees and were bootstrapped (600 pseudosamples) to assess the robustness. The percentage of replicate trees in which the associated taxa clustered together in the bootstrap test is shown next to the branches. The unit of the scale bar is the number of amino-acid substitutions per site."
