Maximum-likelihood tree for the order Thalassiosirales.The phylogenetic tree was constructed using the Tamura-3-parameter model with all unique V4-region sequences. Boot strap values (1000 replicates) above 80% are shown at branch nodes. Identical sequences were removed from analysis and the representative sequence referenced in Table S1. The number of identical sequences per species is listed in brackets and problem pairs discussed in the text are indicated by an *."
