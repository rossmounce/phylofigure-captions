"pone.0027697.g004.png","Relaxed molecular-clock chronogram and phylogeographic reconstruction of Juniperus brevifolia. Maximum clade credibility tree summarized from the geospatial Bayesian analysis of cpDNA (petN-psbM, trnS-trnG and trnT-trnL sequences) of 71 individuals of J. brevifolia. Pie charts represent posterior probability distributions of ancestral range at well-supported nodes of interest. Colored rectangles represent the sample's island of origin. The haplotype relatedness is also shown in the well-supported clades. Colonization routes supported by a BF>3 are shown on the map. The color of each route represents its relative support, with more intense colors indicating stronger support. Arrows specify directionality in the colonization route, inferred from well-supported nodes of interest in the geospatial Bayesian analysis. The map is based on satellite images available in Google Earth (http://earth.google.com)."
