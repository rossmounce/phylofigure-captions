"pone.0091156.g005.png","Phylogenetic trees of genome-length HCV RNA populations obtained in long-term cell culture.The phylogenetic trees are depicted on the basis of nucleotide sequences of all cDNA clones obtained by 0-year, 2-year, and 4-year cultures of OL, OL8, OL11, and OL14 cells. (A) The 5′-terminus-NS2 regions of genome-length HCV RNA. ON/C-2 indicates the original sequences of the 5′-terminus-NS2 regions of ON/C-5B/QR,KE,SR RNA [21]. (B) The NS3-NS5B regions of genome-length HCV RNA. O/3-5B/QR,KE,SR indicates the original sequences of the NS3-NS5B regions of ON/C-5B/QR,KE,SR RNA [21]."
