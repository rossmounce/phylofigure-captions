"pone.0068681.g005.png","Phylogenetic analysis of R-SNAREs from Verticillium and other fungal species.The entire amino acid sequences of R-SNARE proteins of Verticillium and other fungi were aligned using Clustal X and the MP phylogenetic tree was constructed using PhyML package with kimura model under 100 replicationss of bootstrap analysis. Separate clades are indicated by vertical bars, branch times values were given. Qc-type Vam7 of E. cuniculi was used as an outgroup."
