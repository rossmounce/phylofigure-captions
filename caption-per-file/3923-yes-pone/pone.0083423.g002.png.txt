Phylogenetic analysis of common carp caspase-3A.The phylogenetic tree of caspase-3A genes from different species was constructed using the neighbor-joining (NJ) method within MEGA software (version 5.2). The scale bar indicates the average number of amino acid substitutions per site, and the bootstrap values were marked at the nodes of this tree. The GenBank accession numbers of caspase-3 amino acid sequences used here are as follows: rock bream AFM09714.1, large yellow croaker EU878546.1, mandarin fish (Siniperca chuatsi) ADK47519.1, cinnamon clownfish (Amphiprion melanopus) AEA08874.1, Fugu rubripes (Takifugu rubripes) NP_001027871.1, Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) ADJ57601.1, white cloud mountainminnow ACV31395.1, rainbow trout NP_001233264.1, Atlantic salmon NP_001133393.1, Atlantic salmon caspase-3B AAY28972, channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus) NP_001188010.1, rat NP_037054, rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) NP_001075586.1, pig (Sus scrofa) NP_999296.1, dog (Canis lupus familiaris) NP_001003042.1, cattle (Bos taurus) NP_001071308.1, sheep (Ovis aries) XP_004021739.1, goat (Capra hircus) AFC90098.1, blood fluke (Schistosoma mansoni) XP_002574296.1 and Pacific white shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei) ABW69658.1. The others are listed in Table 2 and Fig. 1."
