Phylogenetics of UBA.A) SPLITSTREE neighbor-net network of Satr-UBA alleles (blue) with relevant outgroup sequences from S. salar (green) and O. mykiss (red). Square nodes indicate the novel alleles identified from the Srahrevagh River, Co. Mayo. Parallel lines indicate splits in the network. Bootstrap support values (1000 replicates) are presented for the most relevant splits in the network. Large loops imply areas of phylogenetic uncertainty or reticulations. The frequency of these in the network implies that recombination is an important factor in the evolution of Satr-UBA, predominantly between the α1 and α2 domains. Conversely, good bootstrap support for splits involving several closely related Satr-UBA alleles is suggestive of conventional radiation by point mutation. Roman numerals (α1/α2) indicate the lineages to which each Satr-UBA allele's α1 and α2 sequence belongs (see also Figures 5 and 6). B) Neighbour-joining tree rooted on the midpoint for salmonid UBA amino acid sequences with bootstrap support (1,000 replicates) shown for nodes with 50% support or greater. Nodes in A) and B) highlighted with an orange triangle illustrate how SPLITSTREE is better able to visualise sequences affected by recombination."
