Rooted parabasalid Rpb1 phylogeny shows that Hypotrichomonadea are closer to Tritrichomonadea than to Trichomonadea. New sequences for this study are indicated in bold type, *indicates free-living species, and $indicates data from a publicly available genome sequence. This tree topology was calculated by PhyML 3.0 from 936 unambiguously aligned amino acids spanning conserved regions A to G of Rpb1. Thickened lines indicate the nodes supported by a Bayesian posterior probability of 1.00. Numbers at the nodes correspond to Bayesian posterior probabilities from the best post burn-in 9500 trees, followed by percent bootstrap support ≥50% given by PhyML and RAxML (1000 replicates each), and parsimony (100 replicates, PAUP*). LnL = −26857.70, α = 1.43, pI = 0.088. Removal of constant sites did not change the topology or support in an additional RAxML analysis (results not shown). Metamonada is also recovered in majority-rule consensus topologies when a different outgroup is used (Figure S2). Scale bar represents 0.1 amino acid substitution per site. The complete Rpb1 alignment is provided in the Dataset S1. GenBank accession numbers or Joint Genome Institute locus ID are shown at the left for each taxon."
