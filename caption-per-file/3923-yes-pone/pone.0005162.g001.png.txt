"pone.0005162.g001.png","Maximum likelihood phylogeny of EF-1α including Bayesian posterior probabilities.The tree was inferred under LG, RtREV, and CAT amino acids substitution models using 4 Γ categories plus invariable sites; the LG topology is displayed. Bootstrap support greater than 50% and Bayesian posterior probabilities greater than 0.8 are displayed at nodes, with LG/RtREV ML bootstrap values above and CAT model posterior probability below. Euglenozoan taxa are boxed in blue."
