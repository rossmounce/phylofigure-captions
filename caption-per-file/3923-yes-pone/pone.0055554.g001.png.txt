Predicted amino acid sequence and phylogenetic analysis of MoPex5.(A) Alignment of predicted amino acid sequence of MoPex5 and its homologues. The amino acid sequences of GzPex5 (EAA68640) from Gibberella zeae, NcPex5 (EAA36111) from Neurospora crassa, AnPex5 (CBF85028) from Aspergillus nidulans, PcPex5 (AY366189) from Penicillium chrysogenum and ScPex5 (CAA89730) from Saccharomyces cerevisiae were aligned with Clustal W. Identical amino acids are highlighted against a black background, conserved residues are shown on a dark gray background, and similar amino acids are shown on a light gray background. Four probable TPR domains of MoPex5 were indicated with a line on the top of the sequence. (B) Phylogenetic relationship among MoPex5 and its homologues. The phylogenetic trees of the amino acid sequences were created using the MEGA 5.0 program according to the result of alignment."
