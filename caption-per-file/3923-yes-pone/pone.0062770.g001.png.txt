"pone.0062770.g001.png","Molecular phylogeny of phytoplasmas.The maximum likelihood tree is inferred based on the 16S ribosomal RNA gene. GenBank accession numbers are listed in square brackets following the species names. The numbers on the internal branches indicate the percentage of bootstrap support based on 10,000 re-sampling (only values >80% are shown). The sequence from Acholeplasma laidlawii is included as the outgroup. The species with genome sequences available are highlighted in bold (*partial; **complete). Abbreviations: peanut witches'-broom phytoplasma strain NTU2011 (PnWB NTU2011); sweet potato little leaf phytoplasma strain V4 (SPLL V4); milkweed yellows phytoplasma strain MW1 (MY MW1); Vaccinium witches'-broom phytoplasma strain VAC (VacWB VAC); Italian clover phyllody phytoplasma strain MA1 (ICP MA1); poinsettia branch-inducing phytoplasma strain JR1 (PoiBI JR1)."
