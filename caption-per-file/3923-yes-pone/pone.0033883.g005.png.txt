"pone.0033883.g005.png","The ML phylogenetic tree and network of haplotypes for L. bostrychophila and L. entomophila based on ITS haplotypes. A, the ML phylogenetic tree for both species; B, C are median-joining network of haplotypes for L. bostrychophila and L. entomophila, respectively. Numbers above the branches are bootstrap support values (only values above 50% are shown) and taxa are haplotypes. In median-joining network, white dots represent substitutions (lost haplotypes); for each haplotype, the size is proportional to their observed frequencies. The coloured regions are consistent to Figure 2."
