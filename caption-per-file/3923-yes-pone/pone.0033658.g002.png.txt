"pone.0033658.g002.png","Identification of Neurospora species by phylogeny. Maximum-Likelihood tree produced from the TMI, DMG and TML loci combined. Branch support values (Maximum-likelihood bootstrap proportions/Neighbor-Joining bootstrap proportions) in combined analyses are displayed for major branches only. The well-supported groups of individuals are indicated by triangles, with height proportional to number of individuals and width proportional to the mean number of changes from the node. Only bootstrap proportions greater than 50% are shown. The number of isolates in shown in parenthesis."
