Presentation of the Barcelona HCV isolate 1. (A) Genetic structure of the isolate Barcelona HCV1 (BHCV1), the subgenomic variant (Luc-SGR) with firefly luciferase reporter gene (Luc) and the negative control viruses with a GDD deletion (ΔGDD) at the NS5B region (EI: Encephalomyocarditis virus). (B) A phylogenetic tree drawn of the BHCV1 isolate including strains of various genotypes (3′ NTRs were excluded from this analysis).
