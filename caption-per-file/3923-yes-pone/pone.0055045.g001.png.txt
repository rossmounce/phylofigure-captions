Transmission and scanning electron microscopic images of HH01 as well as a 16S rRNA-based tree.A) Transmission and B) scanning electron microscopic images of HH01. Arrows indicate observed vesicles on the HH01 outer cell surface. Scale bars of 200 nm are indicated in the images. C) 16S rRNA-based tree showing the phylogenetic affiliation of HH01. The tree was constructed using the neighbor-joining algorithm in MEGA5 [45]. Topology was evaluated by bootstrap analysis (1000 repeats, with N. europaea as an outgroup). Only sequences longer than 1450 nucleotides of representatives of the next relative (â‰¥97% similarity) species validly described were included. Numbers in parenthesis indicate the corresponding GenBank entries. Bootstrap values are shown as percentages at the branch points. The scale bar represents the expected number of changes per nucleotide position."
