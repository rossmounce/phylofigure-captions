Phylogenetic and sequence analysis of insect HMGB proteins.(A) Phylogenetic tree of HMGB proteins from insects. The unrooted tree was built using the neighbor-joining method based on the alignment of HMGB amino acid sequences. Numbers indicate the bootstrap percentage support (10,000 replicates). (B) Alignment of the C-terminal portion of HMGB proteins from insects. The AQ-rich regions of the insect HMGB proteins run from positions 37 to 81. For comparison purposes, mammalian HMGB1 proteins were also included in the phylogeny analysis and alignment. The different Orders are represented by the different colors."
