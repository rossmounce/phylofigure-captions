"pone.0080942.g003.png","Phylogenetic analysis of enterovirus 71 (EV-71) based on complete nucleotide sequences of the VP1 gene.Phylogenetic analysis was performed based on the complete nucleotide sequences of the VP1 gene of reference strains and Taiwanese isolates. The phylogenetic tree was constructed with MEGA software by the neighbor-joining method with 1,000 bootstrap replications. Only bootstrap values of over 70% were shown. Amino acid substitutions were visualized through a proteotyping map with colored indications in single-letter abbreviations. Each column represented the amino acid position indicated with a selection criterion of 5%."
