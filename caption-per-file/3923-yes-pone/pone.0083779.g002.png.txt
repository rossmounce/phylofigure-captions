Flagellar gene clusters in Burkholderia.All Burkholderia strains share a highly similar chemotaxis and flagellar gene cluster (fla1) on chromosome 1. Although the A group and the pathogenic B group share high homology in gene sequence and chromosomal arrangement, a phylogenetic analysis of five concatenated protein sequences (FliC, FlgM, FlgE, FlhB, FlgJ) shows a distinct clustering of the two lineages [A]. Additionally, the A group cluster is arranged entirely sequentially [B] whereas the pathogenic B cluster is split into four different regions throughout chromosome 1 (the B. mallei cluster is split into 5 regions)[C]. The fla1 gene cluster is responsible for Burkholderia motility on soft agar, but not for intracellular motility or plaque formation in models of infection [32]. A second flagellar gene cluster on chromosome 2 (fla2) is necessary for this intracellular motility. This second cluster is present only in the pathogenic strains, i.e. B. pseudomallei, B. thailandensis, and B. oklahomensis [D], and a similar cluster exists on chromosome 2 of the opportunistic pathogen B. cenocepacia [E]."
