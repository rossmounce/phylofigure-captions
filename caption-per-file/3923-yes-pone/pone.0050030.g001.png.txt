Dendrogram including all Subfamily A protein sequences.Species and accession numbers are indicated. Numbers above the branches indicate percentage of support, according to bootstrap analysis, ordered as NJ/MP/ML (see Methods). For simplicity, only external branches with significant boostrap values are detailed. Colors indicate the phylogenetic range, in order from top to bottom: animals (pink), apusozoans (orange), plants (green), alveolates (magenta), excavates (violet), fungi (blue) and amoebozoa (yellow). In capital, bold letters the protein structures are summarized, according to InterProScan searches (R: ring finger; B: B box; C: B-box C terminal domain, M: MATH domain). It was not possible to characterize the structures of several of these proteins, for which only partial sequences were available. It can be deduced that the ancestral structure was RBM, with several derivative structures (e.g. RBCM, RBMM, RMM) or losses of domains (RB, BM, RM) occurring in the proteins of particular groups or species. A single Branchiostoma floridae sequence, discussed in the text, had a RBBMM structure (red)."
