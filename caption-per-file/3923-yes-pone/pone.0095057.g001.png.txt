Crithidia mellificae, a trypanosomatid parasite of honey bees.(A) Majority consensus tree of select members of the Trypanosomatidae derived from Bayesian analysis [55], [56] (i.e., MrBayes v3.1.2 [57]) of a glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) nucleotide alignment (799 nt). T. cruzi was selected as the outgroup based on results from previous phylogenetic analyses [15], [39], [50]–[52]. Numbers on branches are Bayesian posterior probabilities (0–1); scale bar corresponds to the proportion of nucleotide change. The genus and species names are consistent with the GenBank accession numbers in the figure; we note that Crithidia deanei was renamed Angomonas deanei. (B) Composite of light and fluorescent microscope images of C. mellificae illustrate the flagellum, kinetoplast (smaller, brighter DAPI stained organelle; yellow arrow) and nucleus (white arrow) of the crithidial stage and (C) additional life-stages in culture."
