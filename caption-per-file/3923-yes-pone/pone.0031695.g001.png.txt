Evolutionary relationships of the 125 HIV-1 reverse transcriptase genes involved into cluster transmissions. The evolutionary history was inferred using the neighbour-joining method [35]. The optimal tree with the sum of branch length = 1.69802916 is shown. The tree is drawn to scale, with branch length in the same units as those of the evolutionary distances used to infer the phylogenetic tree. The evolutionary distances were computed using the Maximum Composite Likelihood method [37] and are in the units of the number of base substitutions per site. Codon positions included were 1st+2nd+3rd+noncoding. All positions containing gaps and missing data were eliminated from the dataset. There were a total of 408 positions in the final dataset. Phylogenetic analyses were conducted in MEGA4 [38]. Viruses isolated in women (○), male infected through heterosexual intercourse (▪) and patients (all were men) infected through unknown intercourse (▾) were represented."
