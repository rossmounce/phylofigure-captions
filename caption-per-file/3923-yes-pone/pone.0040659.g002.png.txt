Phylogenetic tree of the Fungi sequences.Phylogenetic tree of the Fungi sequences recovered from the eight 18S rRNA gene clone libraries, constructed using the neighbor-joining method with the Kimura two-parameter model for nucleotide change. The Ascomycota and Basidiomycota which were just denoted the phylogenetic positions in this tree, presented in other separate phylogenetic trees. The libraries OTUs occurred were labeled. Scale bar, 0.1 substitutions per nucleotide position. Bootstrap values (100 replicates) above 60% are indicated at the nodes. The tree was rooted using the sequence related to Guillardia theta (X57162)."
