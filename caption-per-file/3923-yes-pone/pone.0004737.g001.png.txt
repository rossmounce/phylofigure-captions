Nuclear-encoded plastid-targeted GAPDH (GapC1) phylogeny.The maximum-likelihood tree was inferred from a GapC1 dataset (38-OTU, 312 amino acid positions) by using RAxML. The tree was rooted by cytosolic GAPDH sequences of two ciliates. The GapC1 tree was divided into two major clades, Clades A and B, highlighted by green and orange shades, respectively. The stramenopile homologues are written with bold letters. ML bootstrap probabilities (RAxML/PhyML) over 50% are shown at the branches. The thick branches represent Bayesian posterior probability over 0.95. Major taxonomic groups are labeled on the right."
