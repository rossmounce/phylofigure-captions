Maximum parsimony tree of entire mtDNA genomes belonging to haplogroup HV4. The mutations are displayed along the branches. The position of the revised Cambridge reference sequence (rCRS) is indicated for reading off sequence motifs [15]. All mutations are transitions unless a suffix specifies a transversion (A, C, G, T), an insertion (+), a synonymous substitution (s), a mutational change in tRNA (-t), a mutational change in rRNA (-r), a non-coding variant located in the mtDNA coding region (-nc) or an amino acid replacement (indicated in round brackets). Recurrent mutations within the phylogeny are underlined. The prefix “@” indicates a back mutation. Mutational hotspot variants such as 16182, 16183, or 16519, or a variation around position 310 and length or point heteroplasmies were not considered for the phylogenetic reconstruction. Divergence times correspond to the ML estimates reported in Table 1. Population codes (blue squares on top of circles) for the Cantabrian region: BC = Basque Country, CA = Cantabria, AS = Asturias, GA = Galicia, TE = Teruel, VA = Valladolid, SE = Segovia, GU = Guadalajara; FR = France; NA = Navarra."
