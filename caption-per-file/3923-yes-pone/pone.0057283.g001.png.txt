(B) Graphical representation of the maximum-likehood phylogenetic tree of PICC, PICL and their orthologs. This phylogenetic tree is based on the multiple sequence alignment shown in Figure S1B. Branch support values are indicated at the nodes as calculated by the PhyML program using default parameters.
