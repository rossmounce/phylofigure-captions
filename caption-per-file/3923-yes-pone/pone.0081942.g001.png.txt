"pone.0081942.g001.png","Identification of chicken CRTAM.(A) Ig domains (IgV, IgC1), connecting peptides (CP) and cytoplasmic domains (CY) as well as PDZ-binding motifs (framed) are indicated. The positions of the signal peptides (SP) and the transmembrane domains (TM) are marked by a bar above the sequence. The conserved cysteine residues are marked by asterisks. Exons are numbered according to the genomic structure of the chicken sequence. The alignment was performed separately for the different exons with ClustalW. Identical residues are boxed. (B) In order to delineate the phylogenetic relationships of the chicken and mammalian receptors indicated a neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree was generated using the MEGA5 software. Accession numbers: chicken (gg) CRTAM: NP_001025518.1, turkey (tu) CRTAM: ENSMGAG00000001951, human (hu) CRTAM: NP_062550.2, mouse (mu) CRTAM: NP_062338.3, human CD226: NP_006557.2, mouse CD226: NP_848802.2, human CD96: NP_937839.1, mouse CD96: NP_115854.2, human TIGIT: NP_115854.2, mouse TIGIT: NP_001139797.1."
