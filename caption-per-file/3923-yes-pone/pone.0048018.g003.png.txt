Phylogenetic tree showing the relationship of sequences identified in the midgut clone library.The tree was constructed using near full length (>1200 bp) 16S rRNA sequences using Bayesian inference (ngen?=?15 000 000; BI?=?12 500). Known sequences sharing highest sequence similarity were included in the phylogeny. Branch labels represent posterior probabilities (* denote branches with ?97% posterior probability)."
