Molecular Phylogenetic analysis by Maximum Likelihood method.The phylogenetic tree of myozenin-2-like was inferred by using the Maximum Likelihood method based on the Tamura-Nei model [36]. The percentage of trees in which the associated taxa clustered together is shown next to the branches. The tree is drawn to scale, with branch lengths measured in the number of substitutions per site. The analysis involved 18 nucleotide sequences. Codon positions included were 1st+2nd+3rd+Noncoding. There were a total of 886 positions in the final dataset. Evolutionary analyses were conducted in MEGA5 [37]."
