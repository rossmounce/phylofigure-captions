Summary diagram of Elymus origins.Unbroken lines represent major contributions, and dotted lines show minor contributions. Colors follow Figures 1â€“7. The simple bifurcating division of Pseudoroegneria (St) and Hordeum (H) progenitor species into Old World (OW) and New World (NW) lineages is used for illustrative purposes and does not reflect their true phylogenetic complexity, particularly within Hordeum."
