50% majority rule consensus topology of 195 most parsimonious cladograms, showing the phylogenetic relationships of Plesiosuchus manselii and Dakosaurus maximus within Metriorhynchidae when 40 characters are ordered.Length = 667; ensemble consistency index, CI = 0. 481; ensemble retention index, RI = 0. 863; rescaled consistency index, RC = 0. 415. The black circles at certain nodes denote clades that break in the strict consensus topology. Bootstrap-values are given above or below the relevant node."
