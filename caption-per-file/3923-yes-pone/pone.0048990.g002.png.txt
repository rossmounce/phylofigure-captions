Phylogenetic results from individual gene analyses.(A) The phylogenetic position of turtles within amniotes when all major groups were present and (B) when no crocodilians were present. (C) The relationships between major lissamphibian groups. The ?other? category includes topologies that do not match any of the previously proposed hypotheses, usually with a major amniote group being paraphyletic."
