Phylogeny of 164 FDR-A enzymes from 20 Actinomycetales genomes. Phylogenetic methods and the genomes used are given in the Materials and Methods. For clarity, only the FDR-As that have been characterized biochemically are labeled (M. smegmatis previously characterized (red), M. smegmatis characterized herein (blue) and the other Actinomycetales species characterized herein (pink)). The M. smegmatis enzymes are labeled with their locus tag numbers (the MSMEG_ prefix being deleted for clarity) while the enzymes from the other species are labeled with their complete locus tag. All the characterized enzymes are also given simple number designations (in brackets) to aid comparison with later figures. A fully labeled version of this phylogeny is given as Figure S1."
