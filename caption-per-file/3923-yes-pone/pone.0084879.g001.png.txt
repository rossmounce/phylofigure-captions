"pone.0084879.g001.png","Cyp6g1 and Cyp6g2 copy number in twelve Drosophila species.Cyp6g1 is duplicated in D. willistoni, D. grimshawi and some strains of D. melanogster, and triplicated in D. virilis. The third copy of Cyp6g1 in the strain of D. virilis used for this study has an inactivating mutation, but this mutation is not present in the sequenced strain, so it is not formally a pseudogene. Comparison with the phylogeny of the species suggests that multiple independent duplication events occurred (cladogram inferred from Stark et al.[21]). In contrast, Cyp6g2 has 1âˆ¶1 orthologs in all twelve Drosophila species analyzed."
