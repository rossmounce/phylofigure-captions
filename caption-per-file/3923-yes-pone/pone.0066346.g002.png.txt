Phylogeny of the CtrA protein cross-complementation between KLH11 and A. tumefaciens.A) Phylogenetic analyses of CtrA from members of alpha-Proteobacteria. CtrA sequences from bacterial species in which CtrA has been studied were chosen for phylogenetic anaylsis. The sequences used were A. tumefaciens C58 (GenBank Accession No. NP_355385), B. abortus (AAL86376), C. crescentus (NP_421829), E. chaffeensis (YP_507798), Magnetospirillum magneticum AMB-1 (YP_419992), Rhodopseudomonas palustris (NP_946978), Rhodobacter capsulatus (AAF13177), Rhodospirillum centenum (YP_002297962), Ruegeria sp. KLH11 (ZP_05124475), Silicibacter sp. TM1040 (YP_613394) and Sinorhizobium meliloti (NP_386824). The star indicates the divergence between organisms in which CtrA is essential or implied to be essential and in which CtrA does affect viability, which was originally proposed by Green et al. [37] a = motility-related genes are enriched in putative CtrA binding sites ([12]; b = unable to obtain a ctrA deletion mutant without providing an extra copy of the ctrA gene (J.E. Heindl and C. Fuqua, unpublished) [36]; c = gene target (ccrM) of CtrA is essential [50]. The scale bar indicates the number of amino acid substitutions per site. B) Cross complementation of motility between KLH11 and A. tumefaciens homologues. Wild-type KLH11 (EC1) and derivatives were inoculated on MB2216 (supplemented with 0.25% agar) swim agar plates for about 8 days at 28°C. 200 µM IPTG was added to the media. The diameter of the swim ring was measured. Parentheses indicate from which species the relevant homologue is used (At stands for A. tumefaciens). Values are averages of assays performed in triplicate and error bars are standard deviations."
