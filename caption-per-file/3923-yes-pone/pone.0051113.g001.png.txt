PARN phylogenetic analysis and sequence motifs.(A) Phylogenetic tree of PARN proteins. Colored boxes identify different eukaryotic groups. Bootstrap values (>50%) are shown at the nodes. The length of the tree branch reflects evolutionary distance. The scale bar at the upper left represents evolutionary distance of 0.5 amino acids per position.(B) Sequence logo of the motifs identified in PARN protein sequences. The amino acid residue numbers (according to human PARN numbering) are indicated at the top. The height of each letter is proportional to the frequency of the corresponding residue at that position, and the letters are ordered so the most frequent is on the top. The invariant residues are indicated with dots."
