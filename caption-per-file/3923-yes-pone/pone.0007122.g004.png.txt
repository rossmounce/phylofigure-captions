Maximum likelihood phylogenetic analyses of HIV-1 sequences corresponding to the C2-V5 region of env.Phylograms of blood and genital tract RNA and DNA sequences, derived by single-genome-amplification are shown. Mixing of genital tract and blood sequences were also noted in the phylogram of Subject 13 who was studied while not receiving ART. HIV-1 sequences from plasma (gray stars); PBMC (gray circles), cell-free cervical RNA (black stars) and cell-associated cervical DNA (black circles) are shown. Bootstrap values of >70% are indicated in each tree. Phylograms were rooted using representative sequences, indicated with the letter B, for the corresponding subtype from GenBank (Clade B: B.US.83.RF, B.US.90.WEAU160, B.FR.83.HXB2, B.US.86.JRFL). The scale bar (horizontal line) indicates the horizontal branch length corresponding to 1 substitution per 100 sites."
