"pone.0061354.g005.png","Maximum likelihood phylogenetic analysis of the TPS domain of fused TPSP and single domain TPS proteins.The phylogenetic tree was inferred by RAxML with a LG+F+?4 model of sequence evolution based on 99 sequences and 203 positions. All TPSP sequences located in the upper part of the tree correspond to enzymes with fused TPS+TPP domains. The non-fused single TPS domain sequences are clustering in the lower part of the tree. Bootstrap (BS) values are only indicated at internal branches if they are 30% or higher. The following groups were colored: unikonts (grey); red algae (brown), green plants (green); Archaea (red); Bacteroidetes (blue); Delta-Proteobacteria (lemon); Deinococci-Thermus (orange) and Pan-Crustacean (magenta). The scale bar indicates the mean number of inferred substitutions per site."
