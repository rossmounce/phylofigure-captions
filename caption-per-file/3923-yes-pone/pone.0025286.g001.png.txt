"pone.0025286.g001.png","Bayesian phylogenetic tree of 125 subtype B pol sequences isolated from MSM in Hong Kong and 40 reference subtype B sequences. Posterior probabilities >0.8 were shown at the nodes of the tree. Solid circle at the right indicate the branches were reference sequences isolated outside Hong Kong. Two HIV-1 subtype C sequences were used as outgroup in the tree. Bar, 0.05 nucleotide subsitution per site."
