PhyML phylogram of 167 partial COI (left) and PhyML or Neighbor-joining distance phylograms of full and partial ITS (right) sequences from ∼100 species of mushrooms. Thickened lines represent branches that received ≥0.95 aLRT. Stars indicate COI sequences with an intron in the barcode region. Superscript numbers next to stars correspond to the position of the intron (Fig. 1). Branching for ITS sequences reflect ML- or NJ-based analysis of contigs formed using Sequencher; branching is absent where inter-specific distances are greater than the 20% cutoff value used in the Sequencher contig assembly. Letters at nodes in the genus Pluteus represent the phylogenetic species (reciprocally monophyletic with posterior probability of ≥0.95) of the Pluteus cervinus complex."
