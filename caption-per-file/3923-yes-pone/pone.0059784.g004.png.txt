Bayesian inference phylogenetic tree based on the concatenated sequences of four nuclear genes (WG, LW, EF1?F1 and EF1?F2).Sequences are identified by organism name. Numbers above the nodes indicate the posterior probabilities from the Bayesian analysis. Clades of leafcutter ants and fungus-growing ants are indicated by arrows. The clustered groups of Acromyrmex species, Atta, and Acromyrmex striatus are represented as red, blue, and green, respectively. The topology was rooted using three species in the Myrmicinae subfamily."
