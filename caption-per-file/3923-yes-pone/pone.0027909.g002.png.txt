Comparison of the phylogenetic relationships between Enterobacteria and their respective nematode hosts. A 16S rRNA phylogenetic tree for selected bacteria within the phylum Proteobacteria is shown on the left. An 18S inter-ribosomal RNA sequence phylogenetic tree for selected nematodes is shown on the right. The associations of Xenorhabdus and Photorhabdus bacteria (yellow) with their known hosts are shown with pink and blue lines, respectively. Both phylogenies were constructed using maximum likelihood with bootstrap values indicated at tree nodes (100 replicates)."
