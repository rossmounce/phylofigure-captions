"pone.0011197.g001.png","Tail twisting capability and ecological groupings of blenny genera examined in this study.Field observations showed that Alticus and Andamia are on land during both low and high tide. In contrast, Paralticus [35] and Praealticus exit the water infrequently during low tide (pers. observ.). Istiblennius, Blenniella, and Entomacrodus all are fully aquatic in their habits and only periodically emerge from water, despite being capable of breathing air. Tail twisting behavior in Paralticus is unknown because individuals were not available for examination. The phylogeny used here was obtained from Spring and Williams [28]."
