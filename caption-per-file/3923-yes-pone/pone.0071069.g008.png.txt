Bayesian tree from phylogenetic analysis of Poecilia species for five markers rooted with poeciliid outgroups.Phylogenetic analyses of two mitochondrial and three nuclear genes (5337 base pairs) yielded nodal support values (in percent) represent (from top to bottom) Bayesian Posterior Probabilities, as well as RAxML, and GARLI bootstrap support values. Asterisks denote nodal support of ?95% for all three methods. Nodes with no values present either had low values or were of little interest for this study."
