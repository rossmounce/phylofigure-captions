"pone.0033033.g001.png","Domain structure, homology and molecular phylogeny of pectocins M1 and M2. a) Domain structure of pectocin M1 and relationship to colicin M and plant ferredoxin. b) Sequence alignment of pectocin M1, M2 and pectocin P (see discussion) with [2Fe-2S] ferredoxin type proteins and colicin M. For clarity of presentation prior to alignment pectocin P was truncated to amino acids 1–101 (N-terminal domain) and colicin M was truncated to amino acids 128–271 (C-terminal domain). Genbank/PDBaccession numbers are as follows: Ferredoxin I [S. oleracea] 1704156A, plant-like ferredoxin [Pcc PC1] YP_003017870, pectocin M1 [Pcc PC1] YP_003017875, pectocin M2 [Pcb BPR1692] ZP_03825528, colicin M [E. coli SMS-3-5] YP_001739994, pectocin P [Pcc WPP14] ZP_03830397. Invariant residues are highlighted in black, residues with similar properties in gray b) Nearest neighbour joining molecular phylogenetic tree of [2Fe-2S] ferredoxins and pectocin ferredoxin domains. Bootstrap values (%) at major nodes are indicated. Species names represent independent ferredoxin proteins from listed species, typifying the class of ferredoxin. Proteins discussed in the study are named with species designation in brackets. Plant ferredoxins and adrenodoxin were aligned with signal peptides removed, pectocin sequences were trimmed to minimum region on homology with plant-like ferredoxin from Pcc PC1. Ellipses designate the following: blue = plant-type ferredoxins, red = ferredoxins found predominately in γ-proteobacteria, yellow = ferredoxins involved in electron transport to cytochrome P450. Scale represents substitutions per amino acid site."
