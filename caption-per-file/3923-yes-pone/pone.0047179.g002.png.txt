Phylogentic analysis of HA genes and distribution of various genotypes.(A) Phylogenetic topology of the HA genes from multiple genotypes of influenza B viruses from 2007 to 2012 in Taiwan. The phylogenetic trees were constructed using the neighbor-joining method with 1000 bootstrap replications. Branch values of more than 70 are indicated. Based on the phylogenetic analyses and the amino acid signatures of HA genes, the circulating Yam88 viruses were classified into three genotypes, TW08-I, TW08-II, and TW08-III, which are represented by the viruses B/Taiwan/3798/2007, B/Taiwan/30/2008 and B/Taiwan/2563/2008, respectively. The major amino acid signatures of each genotype are as the following: 63K, 123A and 266M for TW08-I; 165I, 180Y, 244D and 266M for TW08-II; and 244S and 266M for TW08-III. (B) The monthly distribution of various genotypes. The monthly numbers of each genotype are shown as a line chart. The inserts indicate the ratios of the three genotypes in 2008, 2010 and 2011."
