"pone.0022483.g005.png","An example illustrating the necessity of a heuristic to avoid placing a large number of genomes in the overlapping region. The tree above depicts the phylogenetic relationships of the input genomes and the eigenvector element computed using follows a genome name. Two long edges separate A0 and A1 and C0 and C1 from the remaining genomes in the center. The eigenvector elements for the genomes in the center are very small."
