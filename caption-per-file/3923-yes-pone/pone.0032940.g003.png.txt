"pone.0032940.g003.png","Overview of the pan-genome analysis across the M. fermentans strains M64, JER, and PG18. A. The phylogenetic tree of the M. fermentans strains M64, JER, and PG18. The concatenated sequences of the genes dnaE, pyk, and rpoA shared by the three strains of M. fermentans were used for phylogenetic analysis. The maximum-likelihood method was performed to reconstruct this tree using PHYML 3.0. The scale bar stands for the estimated number of nucleotide substitutions per site. B. The pan-genome of the M. fermentans strains M64, JER, and PG18. Venn diagram exhibits the number (including duplications) of genes unique to each strain or shared by these strains (BLASTP E-value âˆ’5). Superscripts represent the name initials of the strains which show the indicated numbers of genes with homologies to other strains. The numbers of genes in the nearly complete PG18 genome may be slightly underestimated due to the presence of gaps and potential unresolved duplications in genome assembly. C. Functional distribution of 378 orthologous groups of genes in the core genome. Some of the proteins have more than one KEGG pathway/biomodule annotation."
