"pone.0019755.g002.png","Phylogenetic relationship of F. fragum genes cry1 and cry2. Tree depicts a consensus of 1000 bootstrap replicates using the Neighbor-Joining method with pairwise deletions and Poisson control. Analyses with 1000 bootstrap replicates under Dayhoff or JTT models were also run and resulted in similar phylogenetic relationships (data not shown). Gray lines represent cnidarian lineages."
