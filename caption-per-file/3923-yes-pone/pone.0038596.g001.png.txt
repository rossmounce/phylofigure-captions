Chaperone-usher fimbrial gene clusters (FGCs) of Salmonella.A phylogenetic tree was built for 35 types of FGCs by using the amino acid sequences of the combined 950 usher proteins from 90 genomes (MEGA 5.0, as described in method). The FGCs were divided into five clades. The scale indicates the number of substitutions per amino acid. The bottom box lists different protein domain families. The asterisk indicates that some subunits were not picked by CDD or InterPro Scan, but (i) showed sequence similarity with other subunit(s) in the same gene clusters and (ii) were typically β-sheet-rich, as are all fimbrial subunits. Framed arrows are either known or predicted adhesins (as described in the text). C, V, VV, VVV were used to define the level of amino sequence variability for each subunit. C indicates subunits for which there was only one sequence available, or subunits lacking variants; V, VV or VVV indicated respectively ≤1, 1–10 or >10 detected variations per 100 amino acids."
