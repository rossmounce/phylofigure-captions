"pone.0070396.g002.png","A simplified representation of the organismal phylogeny for relevant taxa in this study.Green oval represents the endosymbiotic event in the ancestor of the Archaeplastida (Green Algae, Red Algae, Glaucophytes, Land Plants, etc) that gave rise to the modern chloroplast. Gap2 of cyanobacteria became the GapA of the Archaeplastida, with a further gene duplication event in land plants giving rise to GapB. Many of the relationships between eukaryotic supergroups are currently unresolved, and are represented with multifurcations. Indicated with red ovals are lineages that contain the GapC1 gene. While the gene itself is monophyletic, it is unlikely that the lineages that harbour the red-algal derived plastids they are found in represent a clade, with the Haptophytes and Cryptophytes having uncertain affiliation but probably not with the Stramenopiles and Alveolata as once was thought."
