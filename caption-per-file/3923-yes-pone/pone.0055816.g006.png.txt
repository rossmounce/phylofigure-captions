"pone.0055816.g006.png","Comparison of branch lengths estimated under group-specific matrices and an overall matrix.Reduced datasets were used to investigate the impact of model-choice on branch lengths. A. A phylogenetic tree for 21 fish taxa. B. A plot showing differences between branch lengths estimated under partition-specific matrices and the mtFishR0 matrix. C. A plot showing the differences between the corrected branch lengths under a mixture of the partition specific matrices and mtFishR0 for the whole data. Differences between branch lengths (Bl) are measured as (Bl_Ri/Bl_R0) â€“ 1, where Bl_Ri denotes branch lengths obtained using a partition specific matrix, and Bl_R0 denotes branch lengths obtained using the reference matrix (mtFishR0). This measure centers the difference between branch lengths on 0, with values above 0 indicating branches that were larger under the partition-specific matrix and values below 0 indicating branches that were shorter under the partition-specific matrix. A value of zero indicates no difference between branch lengths."
