NJ phylogenic trees of the B. cereus s.l. environmental isolates originated from three locations in northeastern Poland and 28 reference strains.The trees prepared separately for each population were constructed as given in Figure 5. The isolates originated from Bia?owie?a and Biebrza National Parks pertained to three clades, while those isolated from the farm samples clustered to four clades, with only two isolates in clade IV containing B. pseudomycoides reference strains. Detailed information on the isolates and the reference strains used in phylogenetic trees are given in Table S3. Yellow box indicates the cytK positive isolates. Red asterisk indicates the isolates that express the cytK gene in Real-Time PCR analysis. Blue asterisk indicates isolates able to grow at 7?C. B.c., B. cereus s.s.; B.t., B. thuringiensis; B.m., B. mycoides, B.a., B. anthracis, B.w., B. weihenstephanensis."
