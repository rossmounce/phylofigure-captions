"pone.0062560.g004.png","Maximum likelihood analysis and past population dynamics of HIV-1 CRF33_01B disseminating among various risk groups in Southeast Asia (Malaysia and Indonesia).The maximum likelihood reconstruction and past population dynamics of all available CRF33_01B isolates was estimated by PAUP* v4.0 beta [40] and the Bayesian sampling approach implemented in BEAST v1.7 [47], respectively. A total of 242 CRF33_01B sequences (pol region, HXB2?2253?3260) spanning year 2005?2012 among individuals from various risk groups (inclusive of 152 and 90 sequences with known and unknown transmission risks, respectively) and geographical origins (central, northern and eastern states of Malaysia) and two full-length sequences from Indonesia were analyzed. The data set of CRF33_01Bpol sequences were amplified from HIV-1 positive samples collected from the following regions: the central states of Malaysia (n?=?142) including Kuala Lumpur (n?=?54, including four CRF33_01B reference sequences [21], Selangor (n?=?86) and Negeri Sembilan (n?=?2); the northern states (n?=?85) including Kelantan (n?=?79) and Perak (n?=?6); and the eastern state (n?=?13) of Pahang [22]. Indonesian CRF33_01B reference sequences (n?=?2) were retrieved from the online database [27] and included in the analyses. A, Maximum likelihood analysis of CRF33_01Bpol data set containing 152 sequences with known transmission risks revealed a phylogenetic tree with star-like appearance, in which the terminal tree branches (mean length: 0.025?0.014) were in general longer than the internal branches (mean length: 0.005?0.005), possibly suggesting a high growth rate for CRF33_01B during the early phase of the epidemic [48]. In addition, tree topology showed the dissemination of HIV-1 CRF33_01B from PWIDs to other risk groups including the low-risk populations, notably among children who acquired infections through their mothers. B, The Bayesian skyline plot estimated the past population dynamics of CRF33_01B among various risk groups in Malaysia using the CRF33_01Bpol data set of 242 sequences mentioned above (and also in the text). The x-axis represents the time (in units of year) and y-axis represents the effective population size of CRF33_01B. The thick solid line in the plot represents the median estimate and the shaded region represents the 95% highest posterior density (HPD) credible region. The Bayesian skyline plot revealed an exponential increase in effective number of CRF33_01B infections in the host population since its reported emergence around 1991 to 1993 [31] until early 2000s and remained stable thereafter at a high prevalence, suggesting persistent viral transmission and endemicity of CRF33_01B among various risk groups in Malaysia."
