"pone.0014290.g005.png","Homoscleromorph relationships based on the analyses of concatenated sequences from 14 mitochondrial protein genes.Bayesian tree obtained from the analysis of 3278 aligned amino acid positions for the 45 taxa with the CAT+GTR model is shown. Identical relationships within Homoscleromorpha were inferred using Bayesian analyses with the CAT+GTR model and Maximum Likelihood analyses of the small (35 taxa) amino acid dataset. Bayesian analyses with the CAT model as well as ML analysis of the nucleotide dataset and of the 45 taxa amino acid dataset resulted in slightly different phylogenies (Fig. S4). Asterisks indicate nodes within Homoscleromorpha with maximum support values in all analyses. For other nodes within this group, support values represent (from left to right): posterior probabilities in Bayesian analysis using CAT+GTR model with 45/35 taxa, bootstrap support values for the ML analyses of amino-acid datasets with 45/35 taxa, and bootstrap support values for the ML analysis of the 35 taxa nucleotide dataset. Two unstable nodes are shown in red with a minus sign indicating that the node was not recovered in the analysis. For nodes outside Homoscleromorpha, only posterior probability values for the Bayesian analysis with the CAT+GTR model and 45 taxa are shown."
