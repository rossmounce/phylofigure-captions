"pone.0026038.g001.png","Phylogeny of sequenced strains in the context of the global TB phylogeny. Strains marked with a blue circle were sequenced as part of this project. The remaining strains were sequenced previously as part of the TB Diversity Sequencing Project. Strains marked with a yellow circle contain the large segmental duplication near 3.7 Mb. For CDC606 and T67, the results of a digital spoligotype indicate the Beijing group to which these strains belong."
