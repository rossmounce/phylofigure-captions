"pone.0032579.g002.png","A phylogenetic reconstruction of mtDNA control region haplotypes of Southern Hemisphere blue whale populations. Frequencies of haplotypes are shown according to population or geographic region (SO = Southern Ocean, SP = South-east Pacific Ocean, IO = Indian Ocean, AU = Australia) are listed in the table at the right where available. Previously undescribed haplotypes are listed with the sample lab ID code. Sequences from GenBank are listed as Hap_XX where numeric values refer to haplotypes described by Attard et al. [45] and letter values refer to haplotypes described by LeDuc et al. [15]. Brackets denote where two haplotypes (AU) were not differentiated based on the 396 bp sequence."
