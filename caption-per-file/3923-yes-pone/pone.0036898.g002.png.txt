"pone.0036898.g002.png","A schematic of a DLESS-style phylo-HMM: each node of the tree has its own nonterminal, such that the node-rooted subtree evolves at a slower rate than the rest of the tree.Inferring the pattern of hidden nonterminals generating an alignment allows for detecting regions of lineage-specific selection. Expressing this model compactly in XRate 's macro language allows it to be used with any input tree without having to write data-specific code or use external model-generating scripts."
