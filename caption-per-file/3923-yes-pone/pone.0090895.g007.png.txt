"pone.0090895.g007.png","The evolutionary tree diagram of 16 transposase genes in the sweet potato.The evolutionary tree diagrams were drawn depended on the gene sequences similarity between the sweet potato and other higher plants. Each species name with an alphanumeric number means the homologous sequences in different species of each TE in sweet potato with the similarity above 80% (labeled with same digital label). The 16 sweet potato TEs were marked in red boxes. (aâ€“c) the phylogenetic relationships of TEs in three superfamilies named Mutator, PIF-harbinger and hAT. (d) the evolutionary relationships of the 16 TEs with each other."
