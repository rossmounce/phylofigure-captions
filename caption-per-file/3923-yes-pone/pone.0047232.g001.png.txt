"pone.0047232.g001.png","The Cas4 protein family.A. Unrooted bootstrapped phylogenetic tree showing a subset of Cas4 family proteins from archaea. Each protein is represented by a three-letter species code followed by the gene number from the respective genome sequences (Sso, S. solfataricus; Pfu, P. furiosus; Ttx, T. tenax). This neighbour-joining tree was generated from a T-coffee alignment of the proteins using MacVector, with pairwise distances between sequences uncorrected. The bootstrap values shown at each node represent the percentage of all trees (10000 total) agreeing with this topology. B. Cartoon showing the arrangement of the four cysteines acting as FeS ligands and the conserved residues contributing to the active site of the RecB nuclease, for the Cas4 family and related proteins. The blue shading denotes the central portion of the RecB-like domain in each protein."
