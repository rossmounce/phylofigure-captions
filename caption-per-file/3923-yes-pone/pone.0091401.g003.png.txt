Bayesian phylogenetic tree of 120 haplotypes based on the sequences from the studied Central and Eastern European wild boars (254 sequences) and 598 GenBank sequences from previous studies.Haplotypes detected in this study are marked in squares. Note: due to shortening of our analysed mtDNA fragment from 664 to 411 bp (to allow for comparison with previous studies), 3 haplotypes from this study were collapsed to one single haplotype (see Table S1 for details)."
