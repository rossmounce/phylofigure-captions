Phylogenetic tree of the NCLDV major capsid protein (MCP). The MCP phylogenetic tree was inferred with Bayesian approach from a cured alignment of 24 sequences (132 conserved positions) from the NCLDV families, from the A. castellanii capsid homolog fragment, and from the Ectocarpus siliculosus capsid homolog. Poxviruses capsid proteins were not included in the tree as their sequences are too divergent from those of other NCLDV families. Bayesian posterior probabilities are mentioned near branches as a percentage and are used as confidence values of tree branches. Scale bar represents the number of estimated changes per position for a unit of branch length.
