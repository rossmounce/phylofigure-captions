"pone.0014454.g001.png","The workflow.This figure takes HA sequences of H2 subtype as an example to illustrate the workflow. In step I, we carry out a PCOORD (Ai) and a phylogenetic analysis (Aii) using the H2HA dataset. Results from the two methods support their division into two groups, H2g1 and H2g2. In step II, we repeat step I using two sub-datasets, H2g1 (Bi and Bii) and H2g2 (Ci and Cii). Bi and Bii show the results from PCOORD and the phylogenetic tree using H2g1. Group H2g1 is further divided into 5 subgroups. Similarly, Ci and Cii display the results from PCOORD and the phylogenetic tree using H2g2, and this group can also be further divided into some smaller subgroups. In step III, we summarize the results into a table (D) and in a tree-like figure (E). Panel E summarizes the phylogenetic diversity of HA sequences of H2 influenza A virus and values after the underlines indicate the numbers of sequences in the group or subgroup. If there are groups can be further divided based on the results of step II, we will repeat step II until there are no distinctly separated groups or the bootstrap values are too low to support further sub-division."
