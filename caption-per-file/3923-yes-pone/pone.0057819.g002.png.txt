Neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree showing the placement of Geobacter-like environmental 16S rRNA sequences recovered from planktonic biomass at five time-points during carbon amendment.Bolded sequences show the placement of isolate Geobacter 16S rRNA sequences, in the context of the environmental sequences. Sequences within the grey box fall within the G. bemidjiensis/M21/M18 clade, and account for the majority of environmental Geobacter sequences recovered during this study. Accession numbers associated with the environmental sequences correspond to the best match when aligned to SILVA, Greengenes, and the RDP databases."
