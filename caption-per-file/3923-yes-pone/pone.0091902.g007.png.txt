Phylogeny of the Psocodea inferred with mitochondrial genome sequences.Numbers above the left branches show Bayesian posterior probability for the phylogenies from nucleotide sequences, the right from amino acid sequences. Only support above 50% is shown. The insects belong to Phthiraptera, Psocoptera, and Diptera are shown in gray, yellow and pink background respectively."
