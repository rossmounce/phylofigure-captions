Phylogenetic evaluation of DNA polymerase sequences in the sequence library.The unrooted phylogenetic tree was based on a 96 amino acid residue region of viral DNA polymerase sequences obtained from GenBank and putitive DNA polymerase sequences from this study. The letter designations P, S, and U correspond to Podoviridae, Siphoviridae, and unclassified viruses, respectively. All sequences from the K?ne?ohe Bay library are designated with KB. Bootstrap values based on 100 resamplings are shown at the nodes if they were >50."
