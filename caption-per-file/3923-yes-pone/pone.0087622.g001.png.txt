"pone.0087622.g001.png","Phylogenetic tree analysis of the HIV-1 pol region, encompassing the protease and part of the reverse transcriptase, obtained from (A) long term seroconverters (LTS) and (B) recent seroconverters (RS) from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.The phylogenetic inferences were performed by the Neighbor-Joining algorithm under Kimura-2 parameters, nucleotide substitution model using MEGA 5.2 package. Reference sequences from the major HIV-1 subtypes and CRFs BF and CRF02_AG were also included. The scale represents number of substitutions per site. The major subtype and CRF clusters are indicated in different colors. Subtype B samples as well as CRF 28, 29 and 39 were included in the Subtype B group."
