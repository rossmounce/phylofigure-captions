Maximum likelihood tree of totiviral, chrysoviral, and STV RdRp-like sequences.The phylogenetic tree was built using PhyML-mixtures based on a multiple sequence alignment generated using COBALT with the Word Size parameter setting to 3. The base tree was drawn using Interactive Tree Of Life Version 2.1.1 (http://itol.embl.de/). The totivirus-like group represented by Southern tomato virus (STV) was chosen as outgroup for presentation purposes. The p-values of approximate likelihood ratios (SH-aLRT) plotted as circle marks on the branches (only p-values>0.5 are indicated) and circle size is proportional to the p-values. The p-values for the branches relevant to our conclusions are shown. Scale bars correspond to 0.2 amino acid substitutions per site. Asterisk (*) indicates the chrysoviral clade."
