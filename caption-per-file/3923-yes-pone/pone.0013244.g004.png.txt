Dendrogram of bacterial species.Dendrogram depicting the phylogenetic relationships among eubacteria adapted from phylogenetic trees inferred by Jun et al. [25] Cheng et al. [26] and Brown et al. [27]. Branch lengths do not represent evolutionary distance. Only species related to the study are shown; those that that have demonstrated the capacity to harbor the pBAV1K-T5-gfp and/or pBAV1k-T5-luxABCDE plasmid are underlined."
