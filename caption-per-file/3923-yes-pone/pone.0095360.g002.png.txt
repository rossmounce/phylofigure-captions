ML phylogenetic tree of HIV-1 subtype B pol (∼1000 pb) sequences circulating in Panama (n = 761) and other Central American countries (n = 694).The branches are colored according to the geographic origin of each sequence, as indicated at the legend (top left). Red shaded boxes highlight the position of the twelve Panamanian HIV-1 subtype B clades (BPA-I to BPA-XII). Gray shaded box highlights the position of the major Central American clade (BCAM). The aLRT support values for each clade are indicated at bottom. The tree was rooted using HIV-1 subtype D reference sequences. The branch lengths are drawn to scale with the bar at the bottom indicating nucleotide substitutions per site."
