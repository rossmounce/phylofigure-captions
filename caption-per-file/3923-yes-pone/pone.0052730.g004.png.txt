Bacterial distribution of the top 100 abundant families among the twelve samples.Double hierarchical dendrogram shows the bacterial distribution. The bacterial phylogenetic tree was calculated using the neighbor-joining method and the relationship among samples was determined by Bray-Curtis distance and the complete clustering method. The heatmap plot depicts the relative percentage of each bacterial family (variables clustering on the vertical-axis) within each sample (horizon-axis clustering). The relative values for bacterial family are indicated by color intensity with the legend indicated at the top right corner."
