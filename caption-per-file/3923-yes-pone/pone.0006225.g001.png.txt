"pone.0006225.g001.png","Phylogenetic relationship analysis and expression pattern of sid-1 in Spodoptera exigua.(A) The phylogenetic analysis of deduced SID-1 amino acids of insects and nematode C. elegans were conducted using MEGA 4.0, nodes with distance bootstrap values of >50% were indicated, and the branches with blue color represents the closest group with S. exigua SID-1 like 1. (B) Developmental expression patterns of sid-1 like 1 gene in S. exigua from 1st instar larvae to adult. (C) Tissue distribution of sid-1 like 1 gene in S. exigua of 5th instar larvae. The housekeeping gene Î²-actin was used as internal control."
