Neighbor-Joining phylogenetic tree based on the multiple alignment of cloned amplicon sequences of the oriV-rep IncP-9 gene.Sequences from known IncP-9 plasmids have been included as references. Value at each node is percent bootstrap support of 1,000 replicates. BPS1; BPS2 and BPS5 correspond to three different biopurification systems (BPS), located in Belgium. Numbers in brackets correspond to number of clones and numbers without brackets correspond to the clone designation."
