"pone.0057169.g004.png","Neighbour-joining tree representing the Firmicutes-like bacterial clones isolated from H. parallela natural populations that besides Clostridia.Only 1 representative clone from each OTU was included in the phylogenetic tree. Bar charts represent the relative number of clones obtained from each natural population. The 16S rRNA gene sequence of Cenarchaeum symbiosum (U51469) was selected as an outgroup. Clones obtained in this study and closest relative bacterial clones that obtained previously from larvae of other scarab beetles, including Pachnoda ephippiata (P. ephippiata), Dermolepida albohirtum (D. albohirtum), and Costelytra zealandica (C. zealandica) were shown in bold. Bar charts represent the relative number of clones obtained from each natural population. Numbers at nodes are bootstrap support values â‰¥50%. The bar represents 0.05 substitutions per site respectively."
