"pone.0042546.g006.png","Protein sequence alignment and phylogenetic tree of dopa decarboxylase.Protein sequence alignment of dopa decarboxylase (A) and phylogenetic analyses (B) were conducted by the neighbor-joining method using the MEGA4 program with the C. elegans tyrosine decarboxylase as outgroup. The percentage of replicate trees in which the associated taxa clustered together in the bootstrap test is shown next to the branches. The scale bars indicate the estimated evolutionary distance in the units of the number of amino acid substitutions per site."
