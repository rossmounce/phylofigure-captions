"pone.0007504.g002.png","Ancestral state reconstruction of migratory behavior in vespertilionid bats.We used an equal rates Markovian model to reconstruct the evolutionary history of migration in the family Vespertilionidae. The tree shows the probabilities for migratory behavior for the internal branches for portions of the tree. The model and the ancestral states estimates were performed on the whole phylogeny but for better visibility we show only those species which display migratory behavior including two next sister taxa, as well as all the internal nodes and descendants which have reconstructed ancestral probabilities of more than 5% either for short- or long-distance migration. All nodes that have no assignment were classified as non-migratory with probabilities of more than 95%. The common ancestor for P. nathusii, pipistrellus, and permixtus is reconstructed as long-distance migrant as is the common ancestor for Lasiurus cinereus, L. borealis, L. seminolus, L. castaneus, L. ega, and L. intermedius."
