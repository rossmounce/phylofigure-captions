Haplotype maps and phylogenetic reconstruction of COI and the 7th intron of the Dby gene in Desmodus rotundus with sampling distributions. In the statistical parsimony networks each circle represents a single haplotype with circle size scaled by haplotype frequency. Squares indicate the most common haplotype in the network. The COI tree represents the maximum likelihood phylogeny of mitochondrial lineages. Branch supports represent non-parametric Shimodaira-Hasegawa-like (SH-like) values, those equal or greater than 95% are indicated with an asterisk. Inset A) is the Bayesian reconstruction. Y-chromosome intron data is depicted using a UPGMA diagram. Colour coding of branches and haplotype networks matches the sampling distribution."
