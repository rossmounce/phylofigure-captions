Phylogenetic analysis.For comparison to mass spectrometry based clustering a conventional 16S rRNA sequence-based dendrogram generated with ClustalW and Mega 3.1 is shown. Phylogenetic distances were estimated by the method of Jukes and Cantor [15]. The tree topology was inferred by neighbor-joining method with a bootstrap value of 1000. For the reconstruction of phylogeny, the neighbor-joining and maximum-parsimony procedures produced similar results. The 16S rRNA sequences of E. coli strains were identical to the E. coli strains shown in the dendrogram generated on the basis of mass spectra."
