"pone.0059404.g003.png","Phylogenetic tree comparing the amino acid sequences of Clpn1, Clpn2, and Clpn3 in catfish with those of other vertebrate species.GenBank accession numbers of each sequence used in the analysis are indicated on the right side of the species name. The phylogenetic tree is generated based on ClustalW generated multiple sequence alignment using the neighbor-joining method which ignores gaps as implemented in MEGA 4.0. The topological stability of the neighbor tree was evaluated by 10,000 bootstrapping replications, and the bootstrapping percentage values are indicated by the numbers at the tree nodes."
