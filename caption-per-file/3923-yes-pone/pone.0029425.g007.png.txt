Maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree of the most successful LTR transposable elements in the analyzed fungi. Concatenated amino acid sequences of RT, INT, RH and AP protein domains were used as the dataset. The phylogenetic analysis was performed with PhyML. Approximate likelihood ratio test SH-like branch supports above 50% are shown. The tree image was prepared with iTol."
