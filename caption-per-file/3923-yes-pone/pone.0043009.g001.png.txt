"pone.0043009.g001.png","cpn60 UT sequence-based subgroups of G. vaginalis.A. Phylogenetic tree of G. vaginalis-like cpn60 UT sequences comprising four distinct clades: A, B, C and D. Bootstrap values for each node are indicated. 101, 315-A, 41V, 409-05, 5-1, AMD, ATCC 14018T, ATCC 14019, and HMP9231 are G. vaginalis isolates with whole genome sequence information available in Genbank (Accession numbers AEJD00000000, AFDI00000000, AEJE00000000, CP001849, ADAN00000000, ADAM00000000, ADNB00000000, CP002104 and CP002725 respectively). Isolates with names starting with “N” are isolates from Kenyan women from Schellenberg et al. [6]. W11 was isolated from a Canadian woman (Schellenberg, Unpublished). Sequences highlighted in red were used as representatives of the subgroups in the distribution analysis of metagenomic sequence data. B. Pairwise distances for the 26 G. vaginalis cpn60 UT sequences included in the phylogenetic analysis. Distances for both inter-subgroup comparisons (white bars) and intra-subgroup comparisons (black bars) are indicated."
