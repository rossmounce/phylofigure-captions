Maximum likelihood phylogeny of EFL including Bayesian posterior probabilities.The tree was inferred under LG, RtREV, and CAT amino acids substitution models using 4 Î“ categories plus invariable sites; the LG topology is displayed. Bootstrap support greater than 50% and Bayesian posterior probabilities greater than 0.8 are displayed at nodes, with LG/RtREV ML bootstrap values above and CAT model posterior probability below. Branches with hatch marks are displayed at one half their actual length. Euglenozoan taxa are boxed in red."
