Identification of Hog1-regulated kinase, Hrk1, in C. neoformans. (A) The relative expression levels of the HRK1 gene (CNAG_00130.2) from microarray data using total RNA isolated from the WT (H99) strain and ssk1Δ, skn7Δ, and hog1Δ mutants grown to the middle logarithmic phase at 30°C in YPD medium [9]. (B) Northern blot analysis for measuring basal expression levels of HRK1 using total RNA of (A). (C) The phylogenetic analysis of Hrk1 orthologs between C. neoformans and other eukaryotes. The following proteins were compared for the analysis: S. cerevisiae Rck1 (YGL158W, SGDID: S000003126), S. cerevisiae Rck2 (YLR248W, SGDID: S000004238), Homo sapiens MAPKAPK-2, N. crassa Hrk1 (NCU09212.4), A. nidulans Hrk1 ortholog (AN4483, AspGDID: ASPL0000072431), U. maydis Hrk1 ortholog (UM02121), C. neoformans Hrk1 (CNAG_00130.2) and S. pombe Srk1 (SPCC1322.08). The phylogenetic tree was generated by CLUSTAL W (tree-building method, neighbor joining) with MacVector software (version 7.2.3; Accelrys). (D) Multiple sequence alignment of Hrk1 orthologs is depicted by Clustal W alignment from MacVector software."
