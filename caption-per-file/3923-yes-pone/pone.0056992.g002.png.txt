"pone.0056992.g002.png","Samples and muscle insertions.(A) Illustrated phylogeny of gnathostomes showing the position and morphology of the studied taxa: Compagopiscis, Eusthenopteron and Desmognathus. (B) Schematic representations of the different types of muscle/tendon attachments. The fibrocartilaginous (FCE) and unmediated fibrous entheses (UMFE) present extrinsic fibres embedded in the bone cortex, while some periosteally mediated fibrous entheses (PMFE) may have no fibre embedded in the bone matrix."
