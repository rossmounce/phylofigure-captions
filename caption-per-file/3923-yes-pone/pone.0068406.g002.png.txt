"pone.0068406.g002.png","An ML phylogeny inferred from the nifH data for Burkholderia.Similar groupings were generated following BI analysis of the data. Statistical support of ? 60% for ML bootstrap (BS) and ? 0.60 BI posterior probability (PP) are indicated at the branches in the order PP/BS. Isolate/strain designations are followed by legume host names (where applicable) and geographic origin. The names of the indigenous legume hosts are abbreviated as in Table 1. Diazotrophic isolates appear in blue, nodulating isolates in red, and nodulating South African isolates in green with those from this study in bold. The GenBank accession numbers for the nifH sequences are listed in Table S1. The scale bar indicates the number of nucleotide substitutions per site."
