Phylogenetic tree of adenovirus isolates in Peru during 2006–2008.The last 280 nucleotides of the adenovirus hexon gene were amplified, sequenced, and compared to published sequences from GenBank. Samples are labeled according to the following format: “Province of collection - Sample Code - Month- Year of collection.” The comparison sequences are complete genome sequences from GenBank and are presented in the following format: “Accession Number/Serotype in Bold.” Geographical regions are color coded: northern coast region (blue), central coast region (magenta), jungle region (green), and southern highlands region (red). Nucleotide sequences were aligned using Clustal X. Phylogenetic analyses were performed using the Kimura two-parameter model as a model of nucleotide substitution and using the neighbor-joining method to reconstruct phylogenetic trees (MEGA version 2.1). The samples are grouped into species."
