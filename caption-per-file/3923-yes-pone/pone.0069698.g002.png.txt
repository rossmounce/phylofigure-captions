"pone.0069698.g002.png","Frequency of NS3 resistance-associated variants (RAVs) in (A) chronic HCV and (B) longitudinal liver transplant recipients as determined by Roche/454 pyrosequencing.The proportion of pyrosequencing reads that harbored authentic RAVs is indicated by the intensity of magenta shown in the heatmap (p?0.05, chi-square test). RAVs detected in pyrosequence reads that were not significantly enriched compared to background technical error rates are shown in grey (p>0.05, chi-square test). The background error rate was determined using in vitro control transcripts of known sequence that were amplified and sequenced in parallel with the RNA extracted from HCV subjects. Each column is a different sample, and each row represents a different RAV detected by pyrosequencing. Asterisks denote RAVs detected by direct Sanger sequencing. In (A), each column is a different subject (14 genotype 1a and 6 genotype 1b), and in (B), longitudinal samples within each subject (as indicated by the subject code at the bottom) are ordered from left to right, and phylogenetic analysis demonstrates that temporally associated samples are more closely related within subjects than samples between subjects."
