A sample of the bat families studied with ecomorphological characters mapped onto the phylogeny.Bat phylogeny to show species representation based on Teeling et al.[34]. Family call types are taken from Jones and Teeling [41]; no laryngeal echolocation (white); short, broadband, multiharmonic (yellow); narrowband, multiharmonic (purple); constant frequency (blue); narrowband, dominated by fundamental harmonic (green). Labyrinths obtained from this study include Yangochiroptera (dark grey bar): Mormoops megalophylla (a), Pteronotus parnellii (b), Trachops cirrhosus (c), Cheiromeles torquatus (d), Lasiurus borealis (e) and Saccopteryx bilineata (f); Yinpterochiroptera (light grey bar): Rousettus aegyptiacus (g), Rhinolophus pearsonii (h), Hipposideros ridleyi (i), Rhinopoma hardwickii (j) and Lavia frons (k). Representative wing outlines, traced from published figures, as follows: Morpmoops blainvillii (i) (modified from [86]); Pteronotus parnellii portoricensis (ii) (modified from [86]); Artibeus jamaicensis jamaicensis (iii) (modified from [86]); Tadarida pumila (iv) (modified from [49]); Pipistrellus pipistrellus (v) (modified from [49]); Taphozous melanopogon (vi) (modified from [87]); Eidolon helvum (vii) (modified from [49]); Rhinolophus ferrumequinum (viii) (modified from [88]); Hipposideros abae (ix) (modified from [89]); Rhinopoma hardwickii (x) (modified from [89]); Lavia frons (xi) (modified from [49]). Plots represent family distributions along shape axes of the anterior semicircular canal eigenshape 1 (AES1) and anterior semicircular canal eigenshape 2 (AES2)."
