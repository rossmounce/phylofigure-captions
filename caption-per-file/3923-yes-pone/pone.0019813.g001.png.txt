Best-scoring maximum likelihood trees based on 16S (A), 23S domain I (B), and 16S-23S IS (C) rRNA chlamydial sequences. Full-length sequences of C. abortus variant strains and representatives from other Chlamydiaceae species were used. The type strains of other families within the order Chlamydiales were included as outgroups in the 16S and 23S rRNA trees. The trees were reconstructed using RAxML 7.2.6 [38]. The 16S and 23S rRNA trees were generated on the basis of secondary structure alignments created by SINA (SILVA SSU and LSU rRNA database project; [33]) while the 16S-23S IS tree was based on primary structure alignment computed using CLUSTAL X 1.83 [32]. Numbers on branches are support values to clusters on the right of them. Maximum likelihood bootstrap percentages and Bayesian posterior probabilities are included for clades that were consistently recovered using both phylogenetic methods (otherwise only bootstrap values are shown). Bayesian consensus trees are available as supporting material (Figure S5). Accession numbers for sequences retrieved from GenBank as well as for the sequences generated in this study are shown in parentheses. The mark//indicates that branches were shortened for visualization purposes."
