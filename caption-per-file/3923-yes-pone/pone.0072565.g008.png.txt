Phylogenetic tree and pairwise comparisons of representative Alpha-7 lineages and sublineage complete genomes.The phylogenetic tree was constructed as described in Figure 2. Representative genomes for each variant lineage and sublineage described in this report are used and the names of the isolates are shown to the right of the tree branches. The percent nucleotide sequence differences are shown in the panel to the right of the phylogenetic tree as described in Figure 2."
