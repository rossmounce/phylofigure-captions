The analysis of Symbiodinium psbAncr acquired from field samples and isoclonal cultures. (a) Unrooted phylogenetic analysis of partial (∼500 bases) psbAncr sequences recovered from direct sequencing of Symbiodinium from Hawaiian Montipora. The symbiont's ITS2 designation and host species identity are labeled and correspond with phylogenetic groupings based on psbAncr sequences. Samples subjected to bacterial cloning and intensive sequencing are shaded in black. Bootstrap values based on 1000 replicates are labeled for branches separating each lineage group. (b) The phylogenetic analysis of bacterially cloned psbAncr shows minimal sequence variation within a particular sample, but considerable variation between samples. The number of clones sequenced is indicated for each sample analyzed. (c) The extent of intragenomic variation was examined by the cloning and sequencing of psbAncr amplicons from the isoclonal clade C cultures, rt113, rt152, and rt203 (n = 16 sequences per culture). Sequence divergence among variants was small among strains of Symbiodinium goreaui (type C1; rt113 and rt152), however these were nonalignable with sequence variants recovered from rt203. The re-cloning and sequencing (n = 16) of a single cloned amplicon from each cultured isolate (grey arrows) assessed the frequency of artifacts created by the PCR/cloning process."
