Phylogenetic analysis of enterovirus 71 (EV-71) based on partial nucleotide sequences of the VP1 gene (nucleotide position 16-418).Phylogenetic analysis was performed based on the partial nucleotide sequences of the VP1 gene of reference strains and Taiwanese isolates. The phylogenetic tree was constructed with MEGA software by the neighbor-joining method with 1,000 bootstrap replications. Only bootstrap values greater than 70% were shown."
