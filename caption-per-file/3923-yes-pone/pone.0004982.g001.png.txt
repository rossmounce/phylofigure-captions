"pone.0004982.g001.png","Clonal diversity and relationships among 235 Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates.A. Minimum spanning tree (MStree) analysis of multilocus sequence typing (MLST) data for 235 K. pneumoniae isolates, representing 117 sequence types (STs). Isolates of capsular serotypes K1 to K5 are colored according to serotype. Each circle corresponds to a sequence type (ST); ST number is given inside each circle. Grey zones surround STs that belong to the same clonal complex (CC), which is named according to the central ST (the likely founder of the CC). CC65-K2 is delimited by the red triangle (see text). The lines between STs indicate inferred phylogenetic relationships and are represented as bold, plain, discontinuous and light discontinuous depending on the number of allelic mismatches between profiles (1, 2, 3 and 4 or more, respectively); note that discontinuous links are only indicative, as several alternative links with equal weight may exist. The STs of reference genome strain MGH78578 (ST38) and of the type strain ATCC 13883T (ST3) are indicated. B. Split decomposition analysis of concatenated sequences of the seven genes. Numbers at the tip of branches are ST numbers. Note the bushy network structure indicative of pervasive homologous recombination. Branches were colored for the clones that are highlighted on panel A. Note the distribution into unrelated branches of strains with a given capsular (K) type."
