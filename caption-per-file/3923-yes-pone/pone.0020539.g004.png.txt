Maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree of nifH predicted amino acid sequences obtained in the Peru coastal upwelling. Sequences for representative clones (≥95% identity at the nucleotide level) are given in bold (PU and GA indicate representative sequences for the Knorr and Galathea-3 cruises, respectively). Bootstrap support values (≥50%) for 1000 replications are shown at nodes. The scale bar indicates the number of sequence substitutions per site. The archaean Methanosarcina barkeri was used as an outgroup. Accession numbers for published sequences used to construct the phylogenetic tree are given in parenthesis. Additional information is given as Table S1, Table S2, Table S3, and Table S4."
