Comparison of phylogeny and distribution of the basal lineages of the Ethira clade.Below: The 50% majority rule consensus tree of the Bayesian analysis of the Rib COI data set (see Figure 2). The four basal lineages are designated by different colors. The same colors are used to frame the distributional areas of each of the lineages in the map above the tree. The black arrows in the tree mark six events of wing reduction which necessitate from the assumption that the separated distributional area of the harmandi group originated from migration of a winged ancestor. The white arrow points to the single event of wing reduction that follows from the assumption of a Tibetan origin of the Ethira clade. For details see chapter discussion."
