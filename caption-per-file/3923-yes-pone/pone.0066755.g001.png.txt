"pone.0066755.g001.png","Application of MIB/MS to analyze the kinomes of drug-sensitive and -resistant leukemia cells.Kinases from MYL and MYL-R cells were affinity enriched with multiplexed inhibitor beads and quantified by LC-MALDI TOF/TOF mass spectrometry (MIB/MS). Results from three independent experiments were pooled as described in Materials and Methods. (A) Over 150 kinases were quantified from MYL-R relative to MYL cells across a broad spectrum of kinase families, as depicted in the phylogenetic tree of the human protein kinase superfamily. Yellow and blue dots signify kinases that were increased or decreased in abundance, respectively, in MYL-R relative to MYL cells while gray dots signify kinases that were unchanged. Kinome illustration reproduced courtesy of Cell Signaling Technology, Inc. (www.cellsignal.com). (B) The trend of kinase abundance changes for all kinases quantified. Dashed line, ±1.5-fold change. (C) The kinome profile of MYL-R relative to MYL was derived from the kinases that were significantly changed after statistical analysis. The kinase abundance ratios and p-values from three independent experiments were combined and adjusted for multiple hypothesis testing and ratios with a Benjamini-Hochberg q-value <0.2 were considered significant. Dashed lines, ±1.5-fold change; error bars, SE (N = 3)."
