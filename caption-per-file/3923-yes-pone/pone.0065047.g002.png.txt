"pone.0065047.g002.png","Molecular phylogeny of two fish species from central Angola suggests connection of ichthyofauna between the two river systems.Cladograms and haplotype networks for two cichlid species, A) Tilapia sparrmanii (CO1 and S7 intron) and B) Serranochromis macrocephalus (CO1, D-loop, ND2 and S7 intron). Trees represent results of the Bayesian analyses in MrBayes run for 5 million generations (burn-in 25%). Haplotype networks are based on mitochondrial gene(s) and nuclear gene (S7 intro). C) Sampling localities in the Bi? province (highlighted in grey) in the central Angola with the river systems scheme. Some of the localities could be represented by more collection sites. D) Schematic detailed map and schematic cladograms colored by the river system. Presence of the connection between two river systems enabled the putative colonization events. Light blue-green (no. 1) ?=? the Uvalondo subsystem (the Cuanza system), green (4, 5) ?=? the Cuquema subsystem (the Cuanza system), dark green (6) ?=? the Cuiva subsystem (the Cuanza system), and red (2, 3) ?=? the Cutato and Cuchi subsystems (the Okavango system). Connection of the ichthyofauna between the Cuanza (Cuquema) and the Okavango river systems found in both cichlid species. Clades showing this connection are highlighted by blue color. Further, in Serranochromis macrocephalus possible effect of the waterfall and rapids zone was hypothesized (highlighted by violet) separating localities 4 and 5 in the Cuquema subsystem (the Cuanza system)."
