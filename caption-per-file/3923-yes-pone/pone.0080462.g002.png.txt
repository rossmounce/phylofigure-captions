"pone.0080462.g002.png","Phylogenetic analysis of the MADS box gene family.(A) A simplified view of groupings. MIKC-type MADS box genes including APETALA3 (AP3), PISTILLATA (PI), ANTHOCYANIDINREDUCTASE (ANR), SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE (SVP), AGAMOUS (AG), SUPPRESOROFOVEREXPRESSIONOFCONSTANS1 (SOC1), APETALA1 (AP1), AGAMOUS-LIKE6 (AGL6) and SEPALLATA (SEP) are indicated by unfilled triangles. M-type MADS box genes including Mα, Mβ, Mγ and Mδ(S type and P type) are indicated by unfilled triangles. The A/E class of MADS box gene comprises AP1, AGL6 and SEP genes; the C/D class comprises of AG genes and the B class comprises of PI and AP3 genes. The numbers in the parenthesis indicate the number of MADS box genes identified in P. aphrodite versus the total number of genes. Altogether, 121 MADS box genes were used in this phylogenetic analysis: 30 from Arabidopsis, 28 from rice, and 63 from orchid species (among which, 28 were identified in P. aphrodite). (B) Detailed phylogenetic analysis of class B genes, AP3 and PI. (C) Detailed phylogenetic analysis of class A genes AP1 and AGL6. Accession number and gene information are listed in Table S4 in File S1."
