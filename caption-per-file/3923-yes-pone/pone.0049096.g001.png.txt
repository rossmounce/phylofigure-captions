Maximum parsimony (MP) phylogenetic trees and schemata of intron gains in Botryotinia and Monilinia spp.(A) and (B), MP phylogenetic trees based on cDNA sequences and intron sequences at position 164 of the Cyt b gene from Botryotinia and Monilinia spp. The numbers at each node indicate the bootstrap (BS) values (N?=?500) supporting individual branches. (C) Schemata of position 164 intron gains from lateral transfers in Monilinia species M. fructicola, M. yunnanensis and M. mumecola. Intron names are shown in parenthesis after the species name. The GenBank accession nos. of Cyt b genes in Botryotinia and Monilinia spp were AB428335 (B. fuckeliana), GQ304941 (M. fructicola), GU952817 (M. laxa), HM149254 (M. fructigena), HQ908793 (M. yunnanensis) and JN204425 (M. mumecola) which include the cDNA sequences and intron sequences at position 164."
