Phylogenetic Reconstruction of mGluR class III genes.mGluR sequences of class III metapotropic glutamate receptors of the following species were used in phylogenetic reconstructions (hs = Homo sapiens; mm = Mus musculus and dr = Danio rerio). Sequences were aligned using MUSCLE. A conserved stretch of 746 amino acids determined by the program Gblocks was used for phylogenetic reconstruction. The phylogenetic tree was build using the maximum likelihood method with the WAG amino acid replacement matrix. LRT values above 0.5 are shown. While zebrafish mglurs are shown in dark red, mouse mGluRs are given in light gray and human mGluRs in dark gray. The genomic organization of mGluR6 differs from other class III mGluRs. Analysis of the last exons within the class III mGluRs reveals an exon split and a reduced coding sequence length in mGluR6. While the first 7 exons within the class III mGluR subfamily are highly conserved in length, the 936 bp exon 8 found in mGluR4, mGluR7 and mGluR8 is split in mGluR6 (628 bp+308 bp). Moreover the sequence length following the split exons is significantly reduced. Human and zebrafish sequence identity is indicated."
