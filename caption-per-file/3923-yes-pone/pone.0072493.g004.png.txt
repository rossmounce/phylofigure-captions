"pone.0072493.g004.png","Supertree summarising relationships in Rutaceae, combining results of the present study with those of other molecular phylogenies (see Methods for details).The tree includes 115 of the 154 genera currently recognised [2]. The distribution of fruit types is optimised on the tree (colour coding of branches). Also shown are the limits of subfamilies and some tribes, including circumscriptions of the tribe Boronieae by: a, Engler [3], [4]; b, Armstrong [5]; c, Hartley [31], [32]. Clades R1 and R2 match those of Fig. 1; clades A-E match those of Fig. 2. Letter codes following taxon names in clade R2 indicate other tribal placements in the classification of Engler [3], [4] (Z, Zanthoxyleae; R, Ruteae; T, Toddalieae; F, Flinderseae). Asterisks denote clades with <50% bootstrap support in analyses of the primary data."
