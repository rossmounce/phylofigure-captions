"pone.0039924.g005.png","Differential infra-specific diversity of Haptophyceae before and during their spring bloom.Tag pyrosequencing reads assigned to the group of Haptophyceae were independently extracted for both sampling dates. Reads sharing more than 97% sequence identity were grouped under the same OTUs using Uclust [38]. All the reads having a size above 400bp and representative of an OTU were aligned together with reference sequences using Clustalw [84]. The representative sequences and reference sequences were aligned using Muscle [38]. The resulting alignments, manually curated using the Bioedit software (http://www.mbio.ncsu.edu/bioedit/bioedit.html), were used to build phylogenetic trees. For tree construction, the Seaview 4.0 software (http://pbil.univ-lyon1.fr/software/seaview.html) [39] was used with Neighbor-joining (NJ) and K2P substitution method. Bootstrap values were estimated from 1000 replications. The unrooted phylogenetic tree displayed 21 OTUs inferred from 299 reads corresponding to March 31st sample, and 56 OTUs inferred from 2,759 reads for April 21st sample. On each branch are indicated the sampling dates with “1-” corresponding to March 31st and “2-” to April 21st, the reads I.D. as it was submitted into the SRA database (SRX031036) and between brackets the number of reads composing the OTU. The taxonomical subdivisions are indicated on the left side of the figure. For relevant clades, the sum of reads “n” composing a cluster was given for each sampling dates."
