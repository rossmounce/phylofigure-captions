"pone.0005758.g003.png","Phylogeny of sxtN.ML phylogenetic tree of sxtN (sulfotransferase) that represents saxitoxin-related genes of cyanobacterial origin that is potentially from members of the Oscillatoriales. ML bootstrap values (when â‰¥50%) are indicated at the nodes. The branch lengths are proportional to the number of substitutions per site (see scale in the figure). Cyanobacterial taxa are shown in blue text, non-cyanobacterial prokaryotes in black text, and eukaryotes (Plantae) in green. The tree has been rooted on the branch leading to the non-cyanobacterial prokaryotes."
