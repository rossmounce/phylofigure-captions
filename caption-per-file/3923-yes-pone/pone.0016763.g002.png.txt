Phylogenetic and chemical diversity of mud dauber-associated Streptomyces. The phylogenetic placement based on partial 16S rDNA sequences of the 15 Streptomyces strains examined for their secondary metabolites. The tree is rooted with Kribbela (GenBank accession number: GQ351313) and Nocardioides (GenBank accession numbers: AF004988). Mycangimycin-producing Streptomyces strains isolated from Dendroctonus frontalis (SPB071 and SPB074) and three Streptomyces strains (S. philanthi) from European Beewolves (Philanthus venustus, P. gibbosus, and P. triangulum) are included [17], [29]. Branch values indicate bootstrap support (>50 are given) of 1000 pseudoreplicates under Maximum Parsimony. The right panel shows the structures and names of the secondary metabolites identified, including the structurally novel macrocyclic lactam, scheliphrolactam. Strain names indicate the wasp species isolation source, which, as well as the compound names, are color-coded according to the compounds produced. Compounds could not be identified from strains indicated in grey font."
