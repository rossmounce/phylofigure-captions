Comparative phylogenetic analysis of pre-suppression and low-level viremia (RT amino acids 157?210).Multiple sequence alignments were performed using 454-RT amplicon 2 pre-suppression 454 consensus sequences and SGA LLV sequences. There were a total of 160 nucleotide positions in the alignment encoding RT amino acids 157 to 210 (region B). Phylograms were constructed and are depicted as described in Figure 2."
