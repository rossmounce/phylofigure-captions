Strong phylogenetic and phylogeographic signal revealed by the genealogical relationships of COI haplotypes inferred using neighbour-joining (NJ) and maximum likelihood (ML) methods.Haplotypes fell into three lineages (L1-L3) and are numbered according to their position (top to bottom) within each lineage in the NJ tree (those in L1 follow on from the eight haplotypes of El-Mergawy et al. [2011c]). Bootstrap consensus NJ tree was computed using Kimura 2-parameter distances and 1000 replicates in MEGA 5.05. Branches with <50% support have been collapsed and in all other cases, bootstrap support is shown next to the branch. ML tree constructed in PhyML. Branch support was assessed using the approximate likelihood-ratio test (SH-Like) and branches with a probability below 0.5 have been collapsed. Support for major branches is shown next to the branch. Abbreviations (where used): TH=Thailand, MY=Malaysia, UAE=United Arab Emirates, KSA=Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Medit.=Countries of the Mediterranean basin (including Egypt, but excluding Syria)."
