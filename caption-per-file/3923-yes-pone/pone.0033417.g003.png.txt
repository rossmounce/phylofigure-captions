Bayesian phylogeny of Calcarea inferred with the RNA7A model for partition stem. Outgroup taxa not shown (compare Figs. S4, S5). Support values are given at the nodes (PP/BS of ML analyses under the same model). Clades are shaded and numbered for taxa that are not monophyletic. Order names are abbreviated: BAE = Baerida; CLAT = Clathrinida; LEUC = Leucosolenida; LITH = Lithonida; MUR = Murrayonida. Insert: ML topologies of two clades that differ from Bayesian inference (with BS values)."
