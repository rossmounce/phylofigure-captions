"pone.0015306.g002.png","Phylogenetic relationships between lactococcal strains. The unrooted neighbor-joining tree (bootstrap 1000, Kimura 2-parameter model) was constructed from the 2,934-bp concatenated DNA sequences of the six loci. a) Tree constructed from the 32 subspecies lactis strains. b) Same tree after addition of the concatenated sequences from two subspecies cremoris strains. Only bootstrap values >80% are indicated. Open and closed circles correspond to dairy strains and non-dairy strains, respectively. The phylogenetic position of the recently sequenced strain KF147 [69] is indicated by an asterisk. This strain differs from strain NCDO2118 (ST25) by only one SNP."
