Strict consensus of the phylogenetic analysis of sauropodomorph dinosaurs. Analysis was based on the dataset of Yates [34] modified by other authors [8], [45]â€“[49] and including Leyesaurus marayensis gen. et sp. nov., showing the strict consensus of 18 MPTs. Bremer decay indices greater than 1 are listed above nodes and Bootstrap values greater than 50% are listed below nodes."
