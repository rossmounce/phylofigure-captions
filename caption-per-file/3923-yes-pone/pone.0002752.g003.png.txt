Circular phylogenetic trees based in Tamura-Nei distances and elaborated using Neighbor-Joining method.Distances were calculated from G1â€“G2 (A) restricted sequences or the secY sequences (B), and are based on analysis of 131 strains of pathogenic species of Leptospira. Numbers above branches represent the percentage of bootstrapping results (2000 replicates). Only bootstrap values above or equal to 50% are shown. L. biflexa was used as the outgroup. Dots indicate strains with divergent positions compared to those from DNA-DNA reassociation analysis [2]."
