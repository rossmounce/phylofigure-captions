"pone.0022218.g003.png","Phylogeny of PPP catalytic subunits in Drosophilidae. The phylogenetic analysis of 227 Drosophila PPP catalytic subunits is presented as in Figure 2. The color of the branches indicates the chromosomal localization of the corresponding genes, the color code of the Muller elements is given in the lower right corner. The names of the 5 novel PPP enzymes that were identified in the present study are labeled by a+suffix and are surrounded by a heavy border. The scale indicates 0.1 amino acid substitutions per site in the primary structure."
