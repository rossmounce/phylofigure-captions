Evolutionary relationships of the nematode and arthropod Class 2 B1 members with the human homologues.The metazoan receptor groups identified are annotated in color. The phylogenetic tree is constructed using the maximum likelihood method implemented in the PhyML program (v3.0 aLRT). Reliability of internal branching is assessed using the bootstrapping method (100 bootstrap replicates). Analysis is based on the amino acid sequence alignment of the TM regions of Class 2 B1 receptors and is performed using only receptors with the full complement of seven TM domains in human, nematodes and arthropods (total of 73). Sequences omitted from the analysis are indicated in Table S1. For simplicity, only bootstrap support for the main receptor nodes is shown. The complete phylogenetic tree is available as Figure S3."
