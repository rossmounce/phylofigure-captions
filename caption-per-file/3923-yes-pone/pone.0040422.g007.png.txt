Phylogenetic tree of HA for HA-NA available strains of A/H1N1 virus.The phylogenetic tree was constructed using 998 complete HA-coding nucleotide sequences for HA-NA available strains of A/H1N1 virus. Cluster I and II correspond to those in Figure S2. (A) The strain names at exterior nodes were colored according to the net-charge in HA1; red: 14-+16, pink: 12-+13, orange: 10-+11, yellow: 8-+9, right blue: 6-+7, and blue: 4-+5. (B) The strain names at exterior nodes were colored red or orange when they had triple (Gln222, Met234, and Tyr274) or single (Tyr274) amino acid mutation in NA, respectively."
