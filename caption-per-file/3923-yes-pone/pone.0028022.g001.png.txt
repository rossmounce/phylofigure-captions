"pone.0028022.g001.png","Putative Tetrahymena GPCR amino acid sequence analysis. Neighbor-Joining phylogenetic tree depicting the relationship of the 9 Tetrahymena GPCR candidates. Two major clades are evident and supported when analyzing the sequences through the PFAM database: cAMP Receptor Family (specifically the Dictyostelium CARs) and the Rhodopsin family. The Gpcr6p protein falls into the Rhodopsin Family clade with a significant domain related to fungal nutrient receptors (Git3). Scale bar represents substitutions per site."
