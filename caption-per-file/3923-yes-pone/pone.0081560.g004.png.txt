"pone.0081560.g004.png","The phylogenetic tree based on 11 concatenated housekeeping genes conserved in the Mycobacterium abscessus group.Each node number represents the percentage of bootstrap support (>70%) from 1,000 resampled datasets. The gene sequences of the argH, cya, gdhA, glpK, gnd, murC, pgm, pknA, pta, purH, and rpoB genes were obtained from 53 genome-sequenced Mycobacterium abscessus strains, and the sequences were aligned and concatenated (18,893 bp in length). The bar represents 0.002 substitutions per site."
