Phylogenetic relationships of the NS genes of H9N2 avian influenza viruses isolated from poultry in Pakistan.Analysis was based on nucleotides 27â€“870 of segment eight of all viruses included in this analysis. NS gene sequences were compared with closely related H5, H7 and H9 viruses (the viruses highlighted in red were sequenced in this study and H9N2, H7N3 and H5N1 viruses isolated in Pakistan previously are indicated in blue, pink and brown respectively). The phylogenetic methods and abbreviations were as described for figure 1."
