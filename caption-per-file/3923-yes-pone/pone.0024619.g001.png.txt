"pone.0024619.g001.png","Information on lysozymes including their phylogenetic relationships and Bt-induced expression profiles. The phylogeny shown in (A) is derived from previously published phylogenetic analysis [10]. Expression profiles are given in (B) and were established from quantitative realtime PCR. The three C. elegans strains (MY15, MY18, N2) were confronted either with pathogenic or non-pathogenic Bt for 8 h. Lysozyme induction is given as the normalized expression difference between pathogen and non-pathogen treatment, such that positive values indicate upregulation and negative values downregulation after pathogen exposure. Relative expression levels were calculated from crossing points following the 2−ΔΔCT method (see methods section). Reddish/yellowish bar colours refer to the lysozymes from chromosome V (lys-1, lys-2, lys-3, and lys-7), bluish colours to those from chromosome IV (lys-4, lys-5, lys-6, and lys-10), and green to that from chromosome II (lys-8). An expression difference of 2 or −2 is indicated by dashed vertical lines. Stars highlight groups that are significantly different from 0 according to a t test and false-discovery-rate adjusted significance levels (all groups with the exception of the three lys-8 groups and lys-2 from MY15)."
