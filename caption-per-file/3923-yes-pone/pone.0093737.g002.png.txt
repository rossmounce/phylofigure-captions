Maximum clade credibility tree of partial VP1 sequences of EV-C species, including strains isolated in this study.The maximum clade credibility tree was constructed from partial VP1 coding region (consensus alignment 343 nucleotides) of CVA-21 (red), CVA-24 (green), EV-C95 (yellow), EV-C96 (orange) and EV-C99 (blue) strains and the prototype strains of other EV-C types. The phylogenetic tree was constructed using Bayesian MCMC method with GTR model of substitution and Bayesian skyline demographic model. Posterior probabilities are shown in each node."
