"pone.0039752.g002.png","Scaled, pruned composite tree used in phylogenetic comparative methods.The OTU, Felinae, in the single MPT (Fig. 1A) was replaced with the whole tree of Johnson et al. [1] and the branches were scaled following Sakamoto et al. [6]. Extant nodes were dated using either first occurrence or molecular divergence dates, whichever is the older, and terminal branches were extended to their last occurrence dates (i.e. modern time). Since temporal ranges of fossil taxa often have large margins of uncertainties (e.g., Pleistocene: 1.81-0.0117 Ma), the midpoint value of the age range was used to date each node and terminal fossil branches were not extended to their younger limit of the age range. Taxa not represented in the morphometric data were pruned from the scaled, composite tree. Color codings are as in Fig. 1."
