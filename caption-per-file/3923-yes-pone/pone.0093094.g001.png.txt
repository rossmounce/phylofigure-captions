Phylogenetic tree of HA gene (A) and NA gene (B) of A/H7N9/2013_China and its Origin.The phylogenetic tree was generated by means of the JC69 distance-based method and using MatLab Bioinformatics Toolbox. (A) The A/H7N9/2013_China influenza viruses are in red and are clustered at the bottom of the tree. The yellow virus strain at the top of the tree is the original source of the HA gene of A/H7N9/2013_China – a 2010 H7N1 virus from Baer’s Pochard of Hu Nan. Some H7N1 viruses also shared high HA similarity with A/H7N9/2013_China from ducks of Zhe Jiang in 2011. A pigeon H7N9 virus from Shanghai also shared high similarity with A/H7N9/2013_China and is clustered with them near the bottom part of the tree. (B): The A/duck/Nanchang/2000/H2N9 and A/duck/Hunan/2007/H6N9 are in yellow and clustered at top of the tree. The A/H7N9/2013_China influenza viruses are in red and clustered at the middle part of the tree. Four South Korea avian H7N9 viruses from 2011 are in green and clustered at the bottom. The distance analysis indicated that the NA gene of viruses from Nanchang and Hu Nan are closer to A/H7N9/2013_China than to the viruses from South Korea."
