"pone.0026999.g002.png","Bayesian phylogenetic tree of the MAPK protein sequences from vertebrates, tunicates, echinoderm, nematodes, arthropods and plants. The red stars indicate 3 earlier progenitors of the MAPK family. The tree is unrooted and Bayesian posterior probability values (>70%) are shown at interior nodes. The scale bar corresponds to 0.1 substitutions per site. The branches that correspond to vertebrates, echinoderm and tunicates, nematodes, arthropods, and plants are marked in black, red, green, blue, and purple, respectively. The species and accession numbers are listed in Table S1. The corresponding amino acid sequence alignment is provided in Figure S3. The abbreviations used are as follows: Isc, Ixodes scapularis; Aae, Aedes aegypti; Ame, Apis mellifera; Dme, Drosophila melanogaster; Api, Acyrthosiphon pisum; Cbr, Caenorhabditis brenneri; Cre, Caenorhabditis remanei; Cel, Caenorhabditis elegans."
