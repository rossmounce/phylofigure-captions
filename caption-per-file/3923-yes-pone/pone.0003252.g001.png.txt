"pone.0003252.g001.png","Phylogenetic tree based on 16S rRNA gene sequence of Pseudoalteromonas and Alteromonas species compared in the study.Tree was generated by maximum likelihood analysis of 1276 nucleotide positions. The sequence alignment and phylogenetic calculations were performed and manually checked with the ARB software package [97]. The 16S rRNA gene sequence of Silicibacter pomeroyi DSS-3 was used as an outgroup."
