"pone.0042147.g005.png","Maximum likelihood tree of polyproteins of endornavirus-like sequences.The phylogenetic tree was built using PhyML-mixtures based on a multiple sequence alignment generated using COBALT with the default parameter setting. The tree was rooted with closteroviruses Pineapple mealybug wilt-associated virus 1 and Plum bark necrosis and stem pitting-associated virus, which belong to the “alpha-like” supergroup of ss(+)RNA viruses. Only p values for the approximate likelihood ratios (SH test) of >0.5 (50%) are indicated. Scale bars correspond to 0.5 amino acid substitution per site."
