"pone.0017172.g002.png","Relaxed molecular-clock chronogram and phylogeographic reconstruction of Cistus monspeliensis based on cpDNA sequences. Maximum clade credibility tree produced by analysis of C. monspeliensis trnS-trnG and psbK-trnS sequences in BEAST, using C. populifolius as the outgroup. Branches are coloured according to the most probable range of their descendent nodes. Pie charts represent posterior probability distributions of ancestral range at well supported (PP>0.95) nodes of interest. 95% highest posterior density intervals for the divergence time estimates of the same nodes are shown. Other nodes with PP>0.95 are indicated with an asterisk (*). Colonization routes supported by a BF>3 are shown on the map. The colour of each route represent its relative support, with darker colours indicating stronger support. The map is based on satellite images available in Google Earth (http://earth.google.com)."
