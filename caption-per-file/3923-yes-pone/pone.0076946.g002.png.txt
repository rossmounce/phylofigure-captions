Phylogenetic analysis and identification of amino acid residues and sequence motifs conserved in DGAT3s.(A) Phylogenetic analysis. The presumed evolutionary relationships among the 27 DGATs from 19 organisms were analyzed by phylogenetic analysis. The numbers in the parenthesis following DGAT names are the calculated distance values, which reflect the degree of divergence between all pairs of DGAT sequences analyzed. (B) Identification of amino acid residues and sequence motifs conserved in DGAT3s. Multiple sequence alignment was performed using the ClustalW algorithm of the AlignX program of the Vector NTI software. Each DGAT sequence name is on the left of the alignment followed by the position of amino acid residue of DGAT protein sequence in the alignment. The numbers before, in the middle and after the amino acid residues in the sequence alignment represent the number of residues in the divergent region as previously used [63]. The letters at the bottom of the alignment are the consensus residues. Color codes for amino acid residues are as follows: 1) red on yellow: consensus residue derived from a completely conserved residue at a given position; 2) blue on cyan: consensus residue derived from the occurrence of greater than 50% of a single residue at a given position; 3) black on white: non-similar residues. The complete sequence alignment is shown in Figure S2. The abbreviations of the organisms are: Ah, Arachis hypogaea (peanut); At, Arabidopsis thaliana; Bd, Brachypodium distachyon; Gm, Glycine max (soybean); Hv, Hordeum vulgare (barley); Lj, Lotus japonicas; Mt, Medicago truncatula; Os, Oryza sativa (rice); Pg, Picea glauca (white spruce); Pp, Physcomitrella patens; Ps, Picea sitchensis (sitka spruce); Pt, Populus trichocarpa; Rc, Ricinus communis (caster bean); Sb, Sorghum bicolor (sorghum); Sl, Solanum lycopersicum (tomato); Sm, Selaginella moellendorffii; Vf, Vernicia fordii (tung tree); Vv, Vitis vinifera (grape); Zm, Zea mays (corn)."
