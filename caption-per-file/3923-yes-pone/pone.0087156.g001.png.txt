Phylogenetic relationships, gene structure and motif compositions of soybean HD-Zip genes.A. The unrooted tree was generated with the MEGA5.0 program using the full-length amino acid sequences of the 88 soybean HD-Zip proteins by the Neighbor-Joining (NJ) method, with 1,000 bootstrap replicates. The percentage bootstrap scores higher than 50% are indicated on the nodes. The tree shows four major phylogenetic subfamilies (subfamily I to IV) indicated with different colored backgrounds. B. Exon/intron organization of soybean HD-Zip genes. Green boxes represent exons and black lines represent introns. The untranslated regions (UTRs) are indicated by blue boxes. The numbers 0, 1 and 2 represents the splicing phases. The sizes of exons and introns can be estimated using the scale at the bottom. C. Schematic representation of the conserved motifs in soybean HD-Zip proteins elucidated from publicly available data. Each colored box represents a motif in the protein, with the motif name indicated in the box on the right. The length of the protein and motif can be estimated using the scale at the bottom."
