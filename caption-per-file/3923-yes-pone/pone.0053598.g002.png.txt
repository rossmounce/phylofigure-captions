Phylogenetic placement of the cyst-forming Acantharia.Molecular phylogeny obtained with Maximum Likelihood analysis based on a concatenated matrix of 18S and 28S rRNA sequences of Acantharia (104 taxa and 2386 bp-long, GTR+I+G model), including cysts (bold red font) and vegetative (bold blue font) specimens collected in plankton nets and sediment traps at different depths. Each picture of a cyst (column 1) is shown together with the vegetative stage (column 2) that shares the highest genetic similarity. PhyML bootstrap percentages based on 500 pseudo-replicates and Bayesian posterior probabilities (PP) are indicated at each node (above and below, respectively) when support values were higher than 60% and 0.8, respectively. Species name of each taxon and accession numbers are provided in Table S1."
