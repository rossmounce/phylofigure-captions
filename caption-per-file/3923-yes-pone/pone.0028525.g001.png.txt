The salivary Kunitz family of proteins in Amblyomma maculatum. Bootstrapped phylogram (1,000 iterations) resulting from the alignment of 101 full-length protein sequences containing one or more Kunitz domains. The numbers on the nodes indicate the bootstrap support, and the bar at the bottom indicates 20% amino acid divergence. Clades with more than 70% bootstrap support are indicated by Roman numerals."
