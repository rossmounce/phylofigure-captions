"pone.0092114.g001.png","Genome-wide phylogenetic analyses based on nucleotide sequences for orthobunyaviruses.Complete coding sequences for nine group C viruses from this study and GenBank reference genome sequences (Refseq) for eight orthobunyavirus were aligned with MUSCLE, trimmed to remove the unaligned termini, and used in construction of the phylogenetic trees by the Neighbor-Joining method and Tamura-Nei model for (A) L genome segment, (B) M genome segment and (C) S genome segment. Complete coding sequence for S segment of Apeu virus BeAn 848 was also included. The scale bars indicate nucleotide substitutions per site. Reliability of the branching patterns was assessed by bootstrap method with the use of 1000 replicates (shown at nodes). Virus names, strain identities and GenBank accession numbers are shown."
