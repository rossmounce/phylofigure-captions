Subtype 6a phylogenies estimated from (A) E1 and (B) NS5B region sequences, corresponding to H77 nucleotide positions of 869–1289 and 8276–8615, respectively. Subtype 6b sequence D84262 was used as an outgroup. Green pies label sequences from our previous studies [8], [9]. Red and yellow pies label sequences from this study, in which yellow pies mark isolates from IDUs with multiple HCV infections. Sequences without pies were retrieved from Genbank. In each tree, five rectangles highlight the further classification of 6a isolates into I, II, III, VI, and VII clusters. Scale bar represents 0.02 nucleotide substitutions per site."
