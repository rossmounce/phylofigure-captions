The phylogenetic trees reconstructed using maximum likelihood method on a basis of nrDNA ITS matrix (left, Log-likelihood ?=??6967.11) and cpDNA matrix (right, Log-likelihood ?=??30277.42).Bootstrap support values from ML analyses using PHYML are given below branches and the corresponding Bayesian posterior probabilities from Bayesian analyses using MrBayes are shown above branches. For simplification, three monophyletic clade A1, A, B, C, D, were marked and also a paraphyletic group A2 on the cpDNA tree. On the ITS tree, four clades and ploidy of each Rheum species was marked and the seven species with multiple clones were also marked with clone serial numbers. The different colours branches were used to mark species with different characters, and the branches of glasshouse species was marked with triangle tag."
