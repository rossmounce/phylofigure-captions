Selenoprotein extinction in arthropoda.Species whose genomes do not code for selenoprotein genes are shown in red. Sec-encoding species are shown in green with the number of selenoproteins found in each genome in parentheses next to its name. Species for which the available data was inconclusive are shown in white. The phylogenetic relationships have been taken from the ncbi's Taxonomy database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/) and the Tree of Life project (http://www.tolweb.org/tree/). The Drosphilidae tree was taken from the Drosophila Sequencing Consortium wiki (http://rana.lbl.gov/drosophila/caf1.html)."
