Simplified overview of Triassic archosauriform phylogeny based upon Nesbitt [48] showing relationships of major clades. Taxa marked with an asterisk were sampled for micro-CT scanning as part of this study. Stars indicate clades with unambiguous osteological evidence for postcranial skeletal pneumaticity (pterosaurs, neotheropods, most sauropodomorphs). The dark grey box delimits the clade (Ornithodira) for which we propose a bird-like air sac system was present. The light grey box delimits the minimum clade for which Gower [34] suggested postcranial skeletal pneumaticity might be present."
