Maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree of representative YR retrotransposons in analyzed fungal genomes.The phylogenetic analysis was performed with PhyML using concatenated amino acid sequences of RT, RH and YR protein domains. Approximate likelihood ratio test SH-like branch supports above 50% are shown. The tree image was prepared with Archaeopteryx [34]."
