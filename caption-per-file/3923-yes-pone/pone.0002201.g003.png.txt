Amino acid replacements at residues within and directly adjacent to the three proton transport channels (D, H, and K) within cytochrome C oxidase subunit 1 (COI) have substantially altered COI structure and presumably function in snakes.On the small snake phylogenetic trees shown, amino acid replacements that occur in snakes at sites comprising the channel are indicated with ovals, and changes at sites adjacent to each channel are indicated with rectangles. Deep colors (dark red and dark blue) indicate replacements at unique sites (see text) whereas lighter colors (light red and light blue) are not unique sites. Sites that were inferred to be under significant positive selection along the Alethinophidian snake branch (by PAML branch-site analyses) are indicated with a plus sign. The relative order of replacements along each single branch has no meaning. These same sites are shown as spacefill representations in the structure, and are labeled and shaded with the same color code as the mark on the tree. One channel is shown per subfigure (A = channel D, B = channel H, and C = channel K). The three proton channels D, H, and K are shown in transparent purple, green, or magenta volumetric representation, respectively. The entire CO1 structure is shown as a transparent grey ribbon structure, heme groups are shown as spacefill representations colored by element, and the magnesium and copper atoms are colored magenta and green, respectively."
