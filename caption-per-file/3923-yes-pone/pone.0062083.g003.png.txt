"pone.0062083.g003.png","Amino acid phylogenetic analysis of the four LSV protein sequences relative to those from representative phleboviruses and Gouleako virus.For the RdRp, glycoprotein, and N protein, Gouleako virus is included as an outgroup to the phleboviruses (tan). Gouleako virus, the closest known bunyavirus relative to phleboviruses, is a member of a proposed new genus in the family Bunyaviridae[36]. Also shown color-coded are the Uukuniemi (blue), Bhanja (red), and SFTS (green) clades of known tick-borne phleboviruses. GenBank accession numbers are reported in the text."
