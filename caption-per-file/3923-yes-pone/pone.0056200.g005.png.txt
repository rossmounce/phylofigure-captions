Principle component analysis & phylogram derived from SPP markers. (A) A representative Fitch and Margoliash phylogram with branch lengths reflecting phylogenetic distances based on Nei and Li genetic distances. Boxed clades and labels correspond to clusters based on Structure simulation at K = 6. Long Yellow Marconi and Lange Westlandse Rode are abbreviated L. Yellow Marconi and L. W. Rode, respectively. (B) Graph showing the coordinates of the first 3 principle components for each variety. Clusters are circled and labeled. Non-clustered lines PI 201234 and CM334 are labeled separately. In this view the Anaheim/Ancho, Mixed and Bell clusters, boxed in black, are difficult discriminate, therefore, this area was expanded in (C) which shows the arrangement of these clusters. Symbols correspond to those representing horticultural classifications in Figure 4."
