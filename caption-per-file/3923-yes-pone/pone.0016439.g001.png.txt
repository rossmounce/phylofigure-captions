"pone.0016439.g001.png","Magnaporthe oryzae Vam7 shares sequence homology with several other fungal Vam7 proteins. (A) Dendrogram of various Vam7 homologs in fungi: MoVam7 (Magnaporthe oryzae), XP_001907727.1 (Podospora anserine), XP_001551407.1 (Botryotinia fuckeliana), XP_001591719.1 (Sclerotinia sclerotiorum), XP_957713.1 (Neurospora crassa), BAF36378.1 (Aspergillus oryzae), XP_001391677.1 (Aspergillus niger), XP_001804975.1 (Phaeosphaeria nodorum), XP_567839.1 (Cryptococcus neoformans), XP_712444.1 (Candida albicans), NP_011303.1 (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), and XP_761553.1 (Ustilago maydis). Sequence alignments were performed using the Clustal_W program and the calculated phylogenetic tree was viewed using Mega3.1 Beta program Neighbor-joining tree with 1000 bootstrap replicates of phylogenetic relationships between VAM7 homologs in fungi. Numbers above the branches represent amino acid substitution. (B) Similarity of the MoVam7 PX domain to those that specifically bind ptdIns(3)P. The amino acid alignment of the PX domains for M. oryzae (MoVam7), S. cerevisiae (ScVam7, NP_011303.1), S. cerevisiae (ScVps5, EDV10670.1), S. cerevisiae (ScMvp1, EDV11508.1), S. cerevisiae (ScVps17, NP_014775.1), and humans (Hs p40phox, NP_000622.2) was performed using Clustal_W [22]. Positions corresponding to Arg58 were shaded. (C) Alignment of the SNARE motifs suggesting that MoVam7 is a t-SNARE protein. SNARE motifs origins: ScVam7 (NP_011303.1), ScVam3 (EDN63963), UmYup1 (XP761553), Scpep12 (NP014624), and HsSnap25 (NP570824). (D) The MoVAM7 gene rescued the CFW sensitivity of S. cerevisiae Δvam7 mutant. The yeast Δvam7 mutant was transformed with the pYES2–MoVAM7 construct expressing MoVam7. The wild type strain was also transformed with the empty pYES2 vector as a control. Serial dilutions of cultures of three independent transformants (a, b, and c) were grown overnight on SD-Met-Leu-His (glucose) or SG-Met-Leu-His (galactose 125 µg/ml CFW) plates, and grown at 30°C for 4 days and photographed. The experiment was repeated at least three times and representative results were photographed."
