"pone.0055726.g002.png","MLST majority consensus phylogeny.A majority consensus phylogeny of 77 V. parahaemolyticus isolates based on 7 concatenated housekeeping loci (dnaE, gyrB, recA, dtdS, pntA, pryC and tnaA) and representing 3,682 total nucleotides was constructed using the Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method as implemented in MrBayes v3.2. The 77 isolates included in this phylogeny were separated into three major clusters (I, II, III) and 12 distinct clades (1?12). Sequence typing (ST) designations for MLST analysis describe the 24 MLST sequence types comprising each of the 12 clades. Distinct clades clearly highlighted by alternating blue and gray shading. Nodes are labeled with posterior probabilities (0?1) while cladogram shading is indicative of branches with weak support (red) and strong support (black)."
