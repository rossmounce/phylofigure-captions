"pone.0002723.g001.png","Phylogenetic analysis of demosponge relationships using mitochondrial genomic data.Posterior majority-rule consensus tree obtained from the analysis of 2,558 aligned amino acid positions under the CAT+F+Γ model is shown. Other methods of phylogenetic reconstruction produced similar topologies [11]. The numbers at each node are Bayesian posterior probabilities. Nodes with ≥95% support are marked with an asterisk. For simplicity, non-demosponge clades were collapsed to triangles. The full tree is presented in Figure S1."
