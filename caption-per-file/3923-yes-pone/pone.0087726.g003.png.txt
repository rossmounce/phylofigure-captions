Phylogenetic tree of FADS2.The amino acid sequences of FADS2 used in the phylogenetic tree included those from European sea bass, gilthead sea bream, salmon, zebrafish, other fish species (Atlantic cod, turbot, rabbitfish, barramundi, carp, rainbow trout, and tilapia), mammals (mouse and human), fungus (M. alpina) and nematode (C. elegans). The horizontal branch length is proportional amino acid substitution rate per site. The numbers represent the frequencies with which the tree topology presented here was replicated after 1000 bootstrap iterations."
