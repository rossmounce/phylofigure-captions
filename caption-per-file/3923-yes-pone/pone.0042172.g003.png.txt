"pone.0042172.g003.png","Inferred phylogenetic relationship among Pulmonata species based on mitochondrial DNA sequences.The concatenated amino acid sequences of 13 protein-coding genes were analyzed utilizing maximum parsimony (MP), maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian analysis (Bayes), using Aplysia californica and A. dactylomela as outgroup. The numbers along branches indicate bootstrap probability (BP) and posterior probability (PP) resulting from different analyses in the order: MP/ML/Bayes. Alternative topologies were correspondingly shown on the downside of the tree. The colourred species indicated that the phylogenetic status of the family Ellobiidae remains problematic."
