Phylogenic tree based on rrs sequences.The complete rrs sequences of B. persica isolates in Israel were compared to rrs sequences from B. persica (Iran) and other Borrelia species (accession numbers are given in parentheses). The phylogenic tree was inferred using the UPGMA method. Parameters were as described in Figure 2. All positions containing gaps and missing data were eliminated from the dataset (Complete deletion option). There were a total of 1522 positions in the final dataset."
