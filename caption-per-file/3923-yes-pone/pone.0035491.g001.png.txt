"pone.0035491.g001.png","HIV-1 subtyping by analysis of phylogenetic relationships of HIV-1 non-structural genes.The analyzed region of HIV-1 genome corresponded to nucleotide positions 5,041 to 6,310 in HXB2. Three sequences were randomly selected for each study subject (see Methods). A phylogenetic tree was inferred by Mr. Bayes using GTR model. The convergence was reached after 10 M MCMC run. The consensus tree was visualized in Figtree v.1.3.1 [54]. Clade credibility values of >0.95 shown by asterisk, Subtype D cluster showed the support of 0.93 indicated by symbol. HIV-1 subtype C reference sequences are shown as blue circles. All non-subtype C group M reference sequences are shown at the bottom of the phylogenetic tree. SIV sequence (CPZ.CM98.CAM3.AF115393) was used as an outgroup."
