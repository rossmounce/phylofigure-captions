"pone.0058126.g001.png","Maximum likelihood phylogeny of the FRD superfamily.A. Phylogram of the NOX family rooted to DUOX genes (outgroup not shown). The tree topology suggests lineage-specific gene duplications in all major taxonomic clades. The NOX1-3 and NOX4 subfamilies possibly diverged before the emergence of metazoans. B. Phylogeny of eukaryotic gene families of the FRE group and the NOX group. According to this model, the DUOX family and NOX family form sister clades, but not the EF-hands containing protein families NOX5 and DUOX. C. Phylogenetic tree of the FRD superfamily. The tree topology proposes that the metazoan STEAP family (red) emerges from the bacterial clade at the base of the YedZ family. The gene AM1_3152 from the cyanobacterium Acaryochloris marina (strain MBIC 11017) (UniProtKB: B0CEP3) was probably obtained from an ancestral gene of the eukaryotic NOX5 family. Explanation: The names of gene families and gene groups are indicated with curly brackets. Branch colors correspond to those of the listed taxonomic groups."
