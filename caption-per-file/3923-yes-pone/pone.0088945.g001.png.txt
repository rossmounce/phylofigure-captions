"pone.0088945.g001.png","Using pairwise distances to rank species or populations.Consider a hypothetical group of taxa (A)?a set of closely-related species or populations of a single species?that is distributed across several islands in an archipelago (B). Differences among the taxa, labeled x1 through x6, can be organized into a pairwise distance matrix (C). We can represent this matrix either as a phylogenetic tree or as a phylogenetic network (D), where a set of weighted splits describes the relationships among the taxa (E). Altogether, these splits represent the group's phylogenetic diversity (PD). By selecting subsets of splits that exclude a given taxon, we can calculate each taxon's contribution to the total PD of the tree or network (F). The Shapley metric (SH) and expected PD complementarity (PD_c) are different approaches for ranking taxa based on split data. Note that the highest-scoring taxa (highlighted values) can differ considerably depending on the type of metric used and whether the splits come from a tree or network. We discuss the reasons for these differences and methods for ranking taxa in Section (ii) of the main text."
