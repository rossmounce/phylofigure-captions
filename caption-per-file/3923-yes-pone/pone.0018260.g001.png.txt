Evolutionary origins of the diploid hybrid Verticillium longisporum based on phylogenetic inference from ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) data comprising 203 taxa and 493 characters. Shown is the single, most parsimonious tree, 20 steps in length. Isolates are represented by a strain identifier. Hosts and geographic origins are given. Bootstrap supports above 70% are shown by the branches. Species delimitations are indicated by vertical bars on the right. The isolates fell into five different groups corresponding to the five species of Verticillium. The exceptions were four isolates of V. longisporum, V. longisporum strains PD589, PD614, PD687 and PD715, which grouped with V. dahliae."
