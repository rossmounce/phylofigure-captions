Lineage specificity classification of predicted N. crassa protein coding gene (PCG) set based on phylogenetic distribution.A black circle indicates that the gene homolog is present in the corresponding lineage; a white circle means it is absent. Number of PCGs in each LS group is shown at the bottom. Note that N. crassa is a member of the class Sordariomycetes, which is within the Pezizomycotina."
