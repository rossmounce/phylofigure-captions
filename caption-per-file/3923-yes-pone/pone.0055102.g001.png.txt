"pone.0055102.g001.png","ORF phylogeny based on alignments of the amino-acid sequences of unclassified and class F intron-encoded ORFs.(A) Phylogenetic tree based on the X-domain and its C-terminal extension. (B) Phylogenetic tree based on the RT-domain. MLE consensus trees based on MSAs generated with Clustal W, using the WAG substitution model. Trees are rooted at their midpoint. Bootstrap results (?75%) are given at each node (PhyML) and the rate of amino-acid substitutions per site is shown at the bottom of each tree. Introns assigned to class F are indicated and highlighted in bold typeface."
