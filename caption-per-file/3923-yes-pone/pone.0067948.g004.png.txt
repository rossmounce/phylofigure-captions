Phylogenetic reconstruction of bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequences retrieved for the Karnico ?light? and ?heavy? and Modena ?light? and ?heavy? clone libraries.Bootstrap values (1,000 repetitions) above 50% are indicated next to the tree branches. The tree displays one representative sequence per OTU and retrieved bands from DGGE (both in bold). Type and non-type sequences closed affiliated to OTU representative (rep.) sequences were retrieved from RDP database to enrich phylogenetic accuracy. A single OTU embraces all clone sequences sharing at least 99% similarity. Side bars next to OTU rep. sequences labels indicate the number of clones belonging to the correspondent OTU for each of the libraries. There were a total of 729 nucleotides position in the final dataset, and sequences belonging to the Cyanobacteria phylum were used as outgroup."
