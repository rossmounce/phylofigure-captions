"pone.0007194.g004.png","Phylogenetic analyses of vlm sequences with ces sequences and with housekeeping gene sequences.(A) ML phylogram resulting from analysis of vlm/ces data for Streptomyces strains and a Bacillus cereus type strain AH187. (B) Strict consensus trees resulting from maximum parsimony (MP) analyses of combined vlm (left half) data and combined 16S rDNA/trpB (right half) data. The vlm data set is mid-point rooted; the 16S rDNA/trpB data set is outgroup rooted with Nocardia farcinica. Branch lengths appear above the branches; bootstrap values (1000 replicates) and Bayesian inference (BI) analysis posterior probability values (parentheses) appear below. Species acronyms are as in Fig. 4A."
