"pone.0002018.g003.png","Estimated phylogenies of ten rickettsial taxa based on 731 representative core proteins.(A) Tree from Bayesian analysis. Three MCMC chains were primed with a neighbor-joining tree and run independently for 25000 generations in model-jumping mode. Burn-in was attained by 2500 generations for all chains, and a single tree topology with exclusive use of the Jones substitution model was observed in post burn-in data. The consensus tree shown here thus has 100% support for every branch. Branch support is from the distribution of posterior probabilities from all trees minus the burn-in. (B) Tree from exhaustive search using parsimony. Branch support is from one million bootstrap replicates."
