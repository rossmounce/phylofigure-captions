"pone.0038241.g002.png","Phylogenetic tree construct by HBV nt 136-1110.(A) clones of family Y. Solid dots indicate the clones from Y1,Y1W,Y2W,Y3F and Y3M; Solid triangles indicate the clones from Y2. Family names starting with number 7 means the samples collected in 2007 otherwise in 2006. Novel recombinants of Y2 were excluded from the phylogenetic tree. (B) clones of family Q and family V. Solid dots indicate the clones from family Q; Solid triangles indicate the clones from family V. A family name starting with number 7 means the samples collected in 2007, otherwise, in 2006. (C) Novel recombinant clones of Y2. Solid dots indicate the clones from Y2."
