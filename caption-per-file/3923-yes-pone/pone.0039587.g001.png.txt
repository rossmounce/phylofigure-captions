"pone.0039587.g001.png","Neighbor-joining tree of 16S rRNA sequences of Saccharina japonica symbionts, based on Kimura's 2-parameter distance.We used two representative phylotypes to illustrate bacterial diversity for each Proteobacteria genus. The numbers at the nodes are bootstrap percent probability values based on 10,000 replications. rRNA algae plastid genes are used as outgroup. Gammaproteobacteria and Betaproteobacteria phylotypes are marked by vertical lines. Other comments see Table 1."
