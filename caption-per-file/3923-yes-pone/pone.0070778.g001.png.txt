Multiple alignment and phylogenetic analysis of EsMYBA1 and related plant R2R3-MYB proteins known to regulate the flavonoid pathway.(A) Alignment of deduced amino acid sequences of EsMYBA1 and other plant R2R3-MYB proteins. Identical amino acid residues are shaded in black, similar in gray. The R2 and R3 domains shown refer to two repeats of the MYB DNA-binding domain of selected MYB proteins. Three conserved motifs, the bHLH interaction motif, the ANDV motif identified in Rosaceae and the motif 6 from Arabidopsis R2R3-MYB family classification are boxed. The two arrowheads indicate the insert position of intron I and II, respectively. (B) Phylogenetic tree of EsMYBA1 and selected R2R3-MYB proteins from other plant species using the neighbor-joining method by the MEGA 5 software. The scale bar represents the number of substitution per site and the numbers next to the nodes are bootstrap values from 1,000 replicates. The EsMYBA1 are indicated as a diamond. The putative regulatory functions of the different R2R3-MYB proteins in the control of phenylpropanoid biosynthesis pathway are indicated. All R2R3-MYB protein sequences were retrieved from GenBank database and accession numbers are as follows (in parentheses): Antirrhinum majus AmROSEA1 (ABB83826); AmROSEA2 (ABB83827); AmVENOSA (ABB83828); Arabidopsis thaliana AtPAP1 (AAG42001); AtPAP2 (AAG42002); AtTT2 (NP_198405); AtMYB12 (ABB03913); AtMYB4 (NP_195574); Citrus sinensis CsRuby (AFB73913); Diospyros kaki DkMYB4 (BAI49721); Fragaria x ananassa FaMYB1 (AAK84064); Garcinia mangostana GmMYB10 (ACM62751); Gerbera hybrid GhMYB10 (CAD87010); Ipomoea batatas IbMYB1 (BAF45114), Ipomoea nil InMYB2 (BAE94709); Lycopersicon esculentum (Solanum lycopersicum) LeANT1 (AAQ55181); SlMYB12 (ACB46530); Lilium hybrid LhMYB6 (BAJ05399); Lotus japonicus TT2a (BAG12893); Malus x domestica MdMYB10a (ABB84753); Medicago truncatula MtLAP1 (ACN795410; Morella rubra MrMYB1 (ADG21957); Nicotiana tabacum NtAN2 (ACO52470); Oryza sativa OsMYB4 (BAA23340); Petunia x hybrida PhAn2 (AAF66727); Vitis vinifera VvMYBA1 (BAD18977); VvMYBA2 (BAD18978); VvMYBPA1 (CAJ90831); VvMYBPA2 (ACK56131); VvMYBF1 (ACV81697); VvMYB5a (AAS68190); VvMYB5b (AAX51291); Zea mays ZmC1 (AAA33482); ZmPl (AAA19819)."
