"pone.0088618.g002.png","Phylogenetic relationships obtained with different phylogenomic data sets.Tree and branch lengths represent results of the TreeFinder analysis of the partitioned mintax4 data set. Node labels represent minimum and maximum support values of analyses of the phylogenomic data sets (mintax4, mintax8; upper row), phylogenomic data sets without RPs (mintax4_noRPs, mintax8_noRPs; middle row), and most purposive subset (MPS) data sets (with or without RPs; lower row). For further details see Table S4. ML bootstrap and ELW support (RAxML, TreeFinder) | PP values (MrBayes, PhyloBayes). A star denotes maximum support, a double star denotes maximum support in all analyses."
