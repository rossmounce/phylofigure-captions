"pone.0077502.g016.png","Phylogenetic tree of Argonaute proteins (AGO).Neighbour-Joining phylogenetic tree are constructed based on protein alignments of Arabidopsis and soybean HATs proteins using ClustalX2. Bootstrap values greater than 50% are shown at the nodes and tree is drawn to given scale of branch lengths. Heat maps were plotted against the phylogenetic tree constructed using soybean protein sequences and GO annotation. L0, L1, L2, and L3 were leaves at 0 short-day, 1 short-day, 2 short-day, and 3 short-day; S0, S1, S2, S3, and S4 were shoot apical meristems at 0 short-day, 1 short-day, 2 short-day, 3 short-day and 4 short-day."
