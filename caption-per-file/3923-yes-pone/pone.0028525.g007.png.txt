Phylogram of tick proteins from the 23-kDa family. The bootstrapped phylogram (1,000 iterations) was obtained from the alignment of deducted Amblyomma maculatum proteins with homologs found in the non-redundant protein database of the NCBI. The Am. maculatum protein names start with Am- and are recognized by a red circle marker; the remaining proteins are named by the first three letters of the genus name followed by the first three letters of the species name followed by their NCBI gi| accession number. The number at the nodes indicates the bootstrap support above 50%, and the bar at the bottom indicates 20% amino acid divergence. Clades and superclades with strong bootstrap support are indicated with Roman numerals."
