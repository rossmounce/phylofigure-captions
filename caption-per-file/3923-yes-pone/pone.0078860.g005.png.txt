Phylogenetic tree of ABCC (MRP) protein sequences from Arabidopsis and Vitis vinifera.The amino acid sequences of all Arabidopsis ABCC (MRP) proteins and those of Vitis vinifera were aligned using the MUSCLE program and subjected to phylogenetic analysis by the distance with neighborjoining method using MEGA5 programme. Accession numbers for Arabidopsis sequences are AtABCC1 (NP_174329.1), AtABCC2 (NP_181013.1), AtABCC3 (NP_187915.1), AtABCC4 (NP_182301.1), AtABCC5 (NP_171908.1), AtABCC6 (NP_188762.3), AtABCC7 (NP_187917.3), AtABCC8 (NP_187916.3) AtABCC9 (NP_191575.2), AtABCC10 (NP_191829.1), AtABCC11 (NP_178811.7), AtABCC12 (NP_174331.2), AtABCC13 (NP_174330.3), AtABCC14 (NP_191473.2) and AtABCC15 (NP_191656.2). AtSKD1 (AEC08019.1) and VvSKD1 (XP_002266534.1) were used as outgroups."
