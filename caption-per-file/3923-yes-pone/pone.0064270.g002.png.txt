"pone.0064270.g002.png","Phylogenetic relationships of the glycosyltransferase domains derived from BPEV, plants, fungi, and bacteria.The glycosyltransferase domains of various plants, fungi, and bacteria that are homologous to that of BPEV were identified by BLAST searching in several databases. The C-terminal regions of the aligned glycosyltransferase domains were used for the generation of the phylogenetic tree. A total of 93 amino acid sequences, including 54 plant sequences (in green), 21 fungal sequences (in brown), 17 bacterial sequences (in black) and the BPEV sequence (in red), were analyzed. The labels of the branches represent the aLRT values calculated using a SH-like method, and only values greater than 0.5 are displayed."
