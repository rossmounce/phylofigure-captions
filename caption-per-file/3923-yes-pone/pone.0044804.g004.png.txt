"pone.0044804.g004.png","Bayesian consensus phylogram of Arachonia inferred using COI, Cytb, and EF-1Î± gene fragments.Taxon codes and Ficus species associations are shown for terminal branches. Grey boxes connect morpho-species with pictures of Arachonia sp. 1 to 7. Circled Roman numerals are references to haplotype groups (Ia to IV). Posterior probabilities are shown for backbone divergences only. Posterior probability support for nodes >90% are given in Figure S3."
