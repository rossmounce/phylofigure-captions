"pone.0015633.g001.png","Comparative genomics and evolutionary lineage of insects. A. Insect gene orthology. The gene repertoire in nine insects: locust (LMI), body louse (PHU), and pea aphid (API) (Hemimetabola); fruit fly (DME), mosquito (AGA), silkworm (BMO), red flour beetle (TCA), honeybee (AME), and wasp (NVI) (Holometabola) were compared. Bar color indicates different orthologous relationships. Black: single-copy genes conserved in all insects (allowing one loss) (bottom). Blue: multiple-copy orthologs conserved in all insects (allowing one loss). Red: other orthologs presented in at least one hemimetabola and one holometabola. The striped boxes show hemimetabolous and holometabolous lineage specific orthologs, which were divided into genes conserved in all species in one lineage (lower yellow boxes, enlarged with an arrow) and those conserved in at least two species in the lineage but not all (upper green). White: partial homology but no orthology classified. Purple: species-specific genes. The phylogenetic tree was constructed using water flea (DPU) as outgroup, with numerals indicating estimated posterior probability. B. GO classification of hemimetabolous- (hemi) or holometabolous- (holo) specific gene families and gene families that underwent positive selection exclusively in hemi or holo insects."
