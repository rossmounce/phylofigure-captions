GenBank and Butterflybase/InsectaCentral accession numbers are given in Table S2. Numbers in bold indicate maximum likelihood bootstrap values based on 100 replicates, while plain numbers depict Bayesian posterior probabilities. Only values ?50 are indicated for both analyses. The bar at the bottom indicates a branch length of 10% distance."
