"pone.0029223.g002.png","Identification of novel hamster endogenous gammaretrovirus sequences in the live attenuated Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) vaccine (SA-14-14-2). (a) Phylogenetic inference of 91-bp overlapping (final alignment length is 82-bp) gammaretrovirus DNA sequences PCR-amplified from the JEV SA-14-14-2 vaccine and hamster cell lines (baby hamster kidney (BHK) and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)) using five different PCR assays. (b) Phylogenetic inference of 910-bp gammaretrovirus DNA sequences PCR-amplified from the JEV SA-14-14-2 vaccine and HAK using three different PCR assays. The new sequences were phylogenetically compared to prototypical gammaretroviruses (GenBank accession numbers in parentheses). MLV, murine leukemia virus; mERV, mouse endogenous retrovirus; FeLV, feline leukemia virus; RaLV, rat leukemia virus; PtrogCERV, Pan troglodytes chimp endogenous retrovirus; GaLV, gibbon ape leukemia virus; KoaRV, koala retrovirus; PERV, porcine endogenous retrovirus. XMRV sequences coded with VP and WPI are from persons with prostate cancer and chronic fatigue syndrome, respectively. X followed by a number in parentheses indicates the number of identical sequences obtained for that fragment. Asterisks indicate sequences without open reading frames. The MLV/XMRV and PERV branches were collapsed to fit the trees to single pages. Stability of the tree topology was tested using 1000 bootstrap replicates in both neighbor joining (NJ) and maximum likelihood (ML) methods. Bootstrap values >60 are shown (NJ/ML). New sequences (fragments 1â€“4) from the JEV vaccine and hamster cell lines are in light blue and red text, respectively. Fragment 5 sequences amplified from the JEV SA-14-14-2 vaccine are in dark blue text."
