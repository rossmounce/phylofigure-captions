Phylogenetic relationships of the concatenated main coding regions of influenza A(H3N2) viruses isolated in the UK during 2003â€“2004. Sequences from reference viruses A/Panama/2007/99 and A/Fujian/411/2002 were included in the dendrograms. For the purposes of comparison, the dendrograms also included sequences from A/New York/38/2003, A/New York/11/2003, A/New York/32/2003, A/New York/199/2003 and A/New York/52/2004. All phylogenies were rooted using A/Panama/2007/99 as an outgroup. Branch lengths are drawn to scale. Viruses isolated from fatal cases are displayed in red type. Bootstrap values (>70%) are displayed on the nodes. Genetic groups I and II are indicated with brackets. Amino acid substitutions characterising these groups are annotated on the nodes."
