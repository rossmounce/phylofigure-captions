"pone.0086192.g001.png","Alignment and phylogenetic analysis of SUP-like genes.(A) Alignment of CsSUP and SUP-like genes. The amino acid sequences of CsSUP, Csa001112 and Cas010435 in cucumber, AtSUP and RBE in Arabidopsis, NtSUP in tobacco, PhSUP in petunia, SlSUP in white campion and Os05g0286100 in rice were aligned using ClustalW in the MEGA5 software package. The black and gray areas indicate identical and similar amino acid, respectively. Zinc-finger and leucine zipper (LZ)-like domains were indicated in black lines. The DLELRL domain [15] was showed in red box. (B) An unrooted phylogenetic tree constructed using the amino acid sequences of CsSUP, Csa001112, Cas010435, AtSUP, RBE, NtSUP, PhSUP, SlSUP and Os05g0286100 based on the neighbor joining method. Branch length is proportional to evolutionary distance."
