"pone.0024457.g005.png","Phylogenetic analysis NAD7 orthologs extracted from the GOS database. A phylogenetic inference based on an alignment of NAD7 protein sequences from the reference set of alphaproteobacterial and mitochondrial species supplemented with a pruned set of GOS sequences (shown in bold). The main alphaproteobacterial orders Rickettsiales, Rhodobacteriales, Rhodospirillales, Sphingomonadales, Caulobacteriales and Rhizobiales are indicated. Note that some GOS sequences are placed at the root of the Rickettsiales clade and that the SAR11 clade encompassing Ca. Pelagibacter ubique is unrelated to the mitochondrial lineage. The tentative placement of the outgroup (OG) is indicated with an arrow. Phylogenies were produced using Bayesian methods with the CAT model. Numbers at nodes denote posterior-probability values. Numbers associated with GOS clades denote the number of GOS sequences here represented as a single terminal node."
