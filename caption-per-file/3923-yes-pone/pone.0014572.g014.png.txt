"pone.0014572.g014.png","Reduced strict consensus of the phylogenetic analysis.Four unstable taxa (Jingshanosaurus, Blikanasaurus, Camelotia, and Ferganasaurus) were excluded from the consensus a posteriori of the heuristic tree searches. Only sauropodomorph taxa are shown (for a complete consensus tree including all outgroup taxa see Appendix S1). Numbers at the nodes represent Bremer support values."
