Temporally calibrated phylogeny of varanids and their outgroups.Size data are indicated by color included on the known temporal ranges are derived from published accounts [21], ranges in black indicate taxa without reliable size data. Extant Shinisaurus was used as an outgroup for tree reconstruction, but the shinisaur clade is homogenous in size and extends into the Cretaceous [3]. Some nodes collapsed for space considerations, but the number of included species is in parentheses next to the taxon name (Dataset S1). Maps present the known distributions of the indicated taxa in red. Mosasaur distribution is based on the five basal taxa included in the analysis. Varanus amnhophilis is a nested member of the Indo-Asian A clade and the discordant distribution of that taxon with respect to other Indo-Asian A taxa is illustrated by the map on the lower left."
