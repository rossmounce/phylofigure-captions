"pone.0033808.g003.png","Scheme summarizing phylogenetic relationships of species and cytotypes in the genus Hordeum based on TOPO6.Diploid taxa were drawn directly at the tree, while tetra- and hexaploids were connected by lines to their inferred parental taxa. Dashed lines indicate uncertainties and double lines depict an autopolyploid origin. Colors refer to the ploidy level of the taxa (tetraploid blue lines, hexaploid green lines)."
