Bayesian phylogenetic tree showing relationships among representative strains of phytopathogenic Pseudomonas species and P. syringae pathovars.The phylogenetic tree was constructed using 2,193 concatenated amino acid of seven housekeeping genes (argS, dnaQ, gltA, gyrB, recA, rpoB and rpoD) with bootstrap values (100,000 generations) shown at the nodes. Strain members of genomospecies 8 (P. avellanae) sensu Gardan et al. [5], including also P. s. pv. morsprunorum M302280, are shown in red, whereas strain members of genomospecies 2 (P. s. pv. lachrymans M302278) and 3 (P. s. pv. tomato) are in blue. P. fluorescens A506 and P. putida UW4 were included as outgroups. To note that strains of genomospecies 2 and 3 are embedded into strains of genomospecies 8. The interior node values of the tree are clade credibility values based on the posterior credibility values produced by MrBayes."
