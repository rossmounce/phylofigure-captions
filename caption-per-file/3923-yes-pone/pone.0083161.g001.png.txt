"pone.0083161.g001.png","Neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree for the fusion gene of NDV isolates.Phylogenetic analysis was performed using the alignment of the first 1662 nucleotide sequence from the fusion gene coding region of NDV isolate. The K148/08 strain (●) was compared to commercial vaccine strains (○) obtained from the GenBank. The percentage of replicate trees in which the associated taxa clustered together in the bootstrap test (1000 replicates) were shown next to the branches."
