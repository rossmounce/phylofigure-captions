Unrooted radiation tree illustrating the phylogenetic relationship between fish beta-defensins.Cod beta-defensin (highlighted by red) falls into the same clade with a large group of other beta-defensins from different teleost taxa. Bayesian posterior probabilities and maximum likelihood values are indicated as percentages on the tree nodes, respectively."
