A phylogenetic tree of bacterial 16S rDNA sequences from Zea seed endophyte clones and cultured isolates. A multisequence alignment of the 16S region bounded by basepairs 867â€“1458 on an E. coli K12 reference sequence was used to generate a UPGMA tree. Included are sequences from clones (UnculturedbacteriumDJMX) and cultured isolates (Genus) which are identified in Tables S2 and S3. Bacterial classes are labelled in red letters at major branch points."
