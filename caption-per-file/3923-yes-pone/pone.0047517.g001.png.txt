Bayesian MCMC phylogenetic tree of 561 influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 HA sequences.The 227 Italian isolates newly characterised in this study are highlighted in red. The specific Italian clades (A–D) including more than two isolates and having a posterior probability of ≥0.9 are shown, as are two main clades including several Italian and non-Italian strains (E and F). The letters indicate the position of the identified clusters, and the scale bar the number of substitutions."
