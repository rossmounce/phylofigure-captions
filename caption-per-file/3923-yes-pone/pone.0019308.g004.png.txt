Unrooted karyopherin-β subfamily phylogeny. Schematic illustrating inferred ancestral relationships between the KAP-β subfamilies, percent identity (%id) values, known roles as import or export factor (I/E) within each subfamily and description of cargo types. This unrooted topology was inferred from a series of phylogenetic reconstructions available in Figure S1. Colored panels highlight three clades of related subfamilies whose phylogenies were initially determined; a subfamily representative of each of these clades, and of XPO6, were then used to infer a family-wide phylogeny."
