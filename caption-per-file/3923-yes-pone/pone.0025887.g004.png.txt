Phylogenetic analysis of S. aureus strains. Phylogenetic analysis based on the core genomes of S. aureus strains and selected accessory elements from CA-MRSA strains. (A) S. aureus phylogeny inferred by split decomposition analysis from pairwise comparisons of the 78,967 variable nucleotide positions identified from the core chromosome sequences of 20 completed S. aureus chromosomes and the 62 S. aureus strains for which unassembled reads were available, including the CA-MRSA strains sequenced in this study, JKD6177, JKD6260, JKD6272. CA-MRSA strains are indicated in colour (red JKD6159, pink JKD6177, orange FPR3757 USA300, blue MW2, light green JKD6260, dark green JKD6272) (B-D), Phylogenetic relationship of Ï†SA2, pMW2 and SCCmecIV inferred by split decomposition analysis of nucleotide differences for each of these accessory elements between CA-MRSA strains. Scale bar indicates the number of nucleotide substitutions per site. All nodes have 100% bootstrap support except those indicated by asterisk (*) which have >60% support (1000 replicates). CC: clonal complex. ST: sequence type."
