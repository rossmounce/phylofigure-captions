"pone.0004053.g001.png","Relationships of M66-2, 6th and 7th pandemic clones, and other closely related toxigenic strains based on 26 house keeping genes (Salim et al. 2005).The relationships of the strains are identical to those in Figure 2 of Salim et al. (2005) but the tree is presented as phylogram as commonly used for easy interpretation. The mutational (m) and recombinational (r) changes with gene names are marked on the branches. The 3 strains compared in this study are highlighted in light green colour. The branch lengths are not drawn to scale."
