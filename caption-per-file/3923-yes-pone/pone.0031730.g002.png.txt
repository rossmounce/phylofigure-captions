Blast and Bayes analysis of MFS transporters. Heatmap of pairwise BLAST bit scores for all known yeast, Drosophila and human proteins containing the MFS protein domain PF07690 [38] (left panel) sorted by a hierarchical clustering (middle panel). Bayesian phylogenetic reconstruction (dendogram) was used to identify 29 fly orthologs that are most closely related to yeast Pho84 (YML123C) and human SLC17A1â€“9. Posterior probabilities are indicated above each branch. Fly transporters found to be expressed in S2R+ cells are shown in bold/italic script."
