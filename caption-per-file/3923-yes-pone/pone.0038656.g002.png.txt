Distribution of map-1 genes in root-knot nematodes.A neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree of the species used in this study was built using SSU rDNA sequences shown in Table S2. Bootstrap support was calculated from 1,000 replicates and values >50% are indicated at the corresponding nodes. The red dot shows the clade clustering species that reproduce by mitotic parthenogenesis, except for M. floridensis. Red and green lines show the species that reproduce by mitotic parthenogenesis or meiotic parthenogenesis/amphimixis, respectively. Orange and blue boxes represent the 58-aa and 13-aa domains in MAP-1 encoded proteins, respectively."
