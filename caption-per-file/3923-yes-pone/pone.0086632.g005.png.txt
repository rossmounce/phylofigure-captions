"pone.0086632.g005.png","Heatmap showing the results of genome comparison of the studied spounaviruses, and the resulting phylogenomic tree.The similarity values were calculated using Gegenees software based on pairwise translated comparison of the analyzed sequences (tBLASTx method, fragment size ?50, step size ?25). The heat plot colors reflect this similarity, ranging from low (red) to high (green). The heatmap is asymmetric because the variable contents of genomes differ in sizes and a similarity is calculated as a fraction of similar sequences in each genome. The tree was constructed with SplitsTree using the neighbor joining method. The scale bar represents a 10% difference in average tBLASTx score. Leaves of the tree are colored by proposed in-subfamily clustering: blue ? Bastille group, green ? Twort group, red ? Bacillus phage SPO1. Abbreviations include name of host taxon (Ba ? Bacillus, Bx ? Brochothrix, En ? Enterococcus, Lb ? Lactobacillus, Li ? Listeria, St ? Staphylococcus) and the bacteriophage name. All analyzed sequences are listed in Table S2."
