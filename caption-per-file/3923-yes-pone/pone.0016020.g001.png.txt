Phylogenetic network based on SNPs discovered in the collection of 58 Beijing isolates. This phylogenetic network was constructed using the median-joining algorithm with the final set of 48 SNPs characterized by sequencing 22 3R genes in 58 Beijing isolates plus one non-Beijing isolate (Myc2). Isolates are color coded according to their geographic origin (A), large sequence polymorphisms (LSPs) (B) and, variations in mutT2 mutT4 and ogt genes (C). The reference strain M. tuberculosis H37Rv (Myc1) was also included. The numbers in each branch correspond to SNPs (Table 1) that enabled discrimination of sequence types. Node sizes are proportional to the number of isolates belonging to the same sequence type: Bmyc4 node (2); Bmyc12 node (3); Bmyc13 node (3); Bmyc19 (2); Bmyc16 node (7); Bmyc10 node (23). See Table S1 for details about strains belonging to each node. Mv represents a median vector created by the software and can be interpreted as possibly extant unsampled sequences or extinct ancestral sequences."
