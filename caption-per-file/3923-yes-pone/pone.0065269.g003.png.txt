"pone.0065269.g003.png","Phylogenetic tree of Hsp70 family in vertebrates.The phylogenetic tree was constructed using the Maximum Likelihood method based on the amino acids of Hsp70 members from human, mouse, rat, camel, cattle, platypus, chicken, frog, zebrafish, pufferfish, fugu, stickleback, medaka, tilapia and the swamp eel. The protein sequences were from NCBI and Ensembl database (protein ID in Table S1). 14 proteins of the swamp eel had been grouped into 7 cluster of Hsp70 family (red arrows). The numbers at the nodes indicate bootstrap values."
