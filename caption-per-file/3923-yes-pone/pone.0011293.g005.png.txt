"pone.0011293.g005.png","Phylogenetic relationships within Cypriniformes.The 50% majority-rule consensus tree obtained by phylogenetic Bayesian analyses, with model GTR+I+Î“, after 5,000,000 generations. Analyses were carried out with four markers whose sequences were downloaded from Genbank: cytb, rag1, rag2 and rho. Posterior probabilities are all indicated on branches. Constraints have been set so that all species are assigned to their respective monophyletic clades determined in previous studies (see Materials and Methods)."
