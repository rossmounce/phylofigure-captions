Cuticle Gene Phylogenetic Relationships. Evolutionary relationships of adult cuticle protein genes (one-to-one orthologs) among mosquito and Drosophila species were inferred using the Neighbor-Joining method. The gene IDs and the species names (5 letters) are shown for the orthologs. The optimal tree (the sum of branch length = 0.842) is shown. The percentage values of replicate trees in which the associated taxa clustered together in bootstrap testing (1000 replicates) are shown next to the branches. The tree is drawn to scale (shown below the tree), with branch lengths in the same units as those of the evolutionary distances used to infer the phylogeny. The distance scale is in units of the number of amino acid substitutions per site. Although fruit fly and mosquito cuticle proteins are a highly conserved family of proteins, the one-to-one orthologs show lineage specific phylogenetic groupings among the 12 fruit fly and three mosquito species."
