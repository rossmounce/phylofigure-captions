Computational analysis of the hexon gene. (A) SimPlot analysis of the HAdV-D59 hexon coding sequence. L1 and L2 correspond to loops 1 and 2 of the hexon gene, which comprise the determinant of virus serum neutralization. (B) Phylogenetic analysis of the hexon L1 sequences in species HAdV-D. (C) Phylogenetic analysis of the hexon L2 sequences in species HAdV-D. A phylogenetic tree was generated along with representatives from the other species. Phylogenetic trees were generated from aligned sequences using MEGA, via the neighbor-joining method and a bootstrap test of phylogeny."
