"pone.0060224.g001.png","General features of N. spumigena CCY9414.A. Photomicrograph of N. spumigena CCY9414 trichomes. The arrows point to heterocysts. The vertical bar corresponds to 40 µm. B. Phylogenetic position of N. spumigena CCY9414 (boxed) within the cyanobacterial phyum, based on its two 16S rRNA sequences (labeled a and b). The two sub-clades within the Nostocales, clade I and clade II, are indicated. Species for which a total genome sequence is publicly available, are in blue. The sequence of Chlorobium tepidum TLS served as outgroup. The numbers at nodes refer to bootstrap support values (1000 repetitions) if >60%. The phylogenetic tree was generated using the Minimum Evolution method within MEGA5 [158]. The optimal tree with the sum of branch length  =  0.85445647 is shown. The tree is drawn to scale, with branch lengths in the same units as those of the evolutionary distances used to infer the phylogenetic tree and are given in the number of base substitutions per site. The multiple sequence alignment was shortened to a total of 1407 positions in the final dataset to include also 16S rRNA sequences from species without a genome sequence."
