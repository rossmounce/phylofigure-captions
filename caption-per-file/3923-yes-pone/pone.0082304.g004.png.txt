"pone.0082304.g004.png","Phylogenetic tree analysis among family members.The Neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree was constructed based on the HCV Core gene from 53 cases in 23 families. The only cases from the same family that are clustered together (BL0001 and BL0002) were highlighted in red filled circle. Bootstrap values are based on 1 000 replicates and statistic values > 70% are indicated at the nodes of the corresponding branches. The scale bar unit is substitutions/site."
