"pone.0011807.g002.png","Identification of a novel red fluorescent protein (NvFP-7R) in Nematostella.(A) Drosophila S2 cells expressing NvFP-7R (scale bar = 25µm). (B) Purified protein solutions of NvFP-7R and DsRed. (C) Excitation and emission spectra of NvFP-7R. (D) Absorbance spectrum of NvFP-7R. (E) Phylogenetic tree showing the position of NvFP-7R with respect to the major anthozoan FP clades (colored clades: A, B, C and D) described in a previous report [13], [15]. In our phylogenetic analysis, the chromo-red protein eforCP/RFP from Echinopora forskaliana seems to belong to the clade B. This tree was constructed by the neighbor-joining method with JTT matrix. Bootstrap percentages over 60% are shown on interior branches. Three Arthropod FPs are used as outgroup. The GenBank accession numbers for the protein names used in this phylogenetic analysis are described in [15]."
