Sequence analysis of the full-length cDNA encoding a Rosa canina type-A response regulator, RcRR1.(A) Phylogenetic analysis of putative RcRR1 from Rosa canina and response regulators in Arabidopsis. The aligned sequences were used to construct a phylogenetic tree by MEGA4. (B) Phylogenetic analysis of response regulators from a range of plant species. (C) Sequence alignment of RcRR1 homologs from different species. The alignment was generated using ClustalW and Espript (http://espript.ibcp.fr/ESPript/ESPript/)."
