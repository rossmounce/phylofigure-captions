Inferred phylogeny of Spongospora subterranea f.sp. subterranea and other Plasmodiophorids.The evolutionary relationship of Spongospora subterranea f.sp. subterranea and other Plasmodiophorids was inferred using the Maximum Likelihood method on the concatenated ITS and actin sequences. The bootstrap consensus tree inferred from 500 replicates is taken to represent the evolutionary history of the taxa analyzed. Branches corresponding to partitions reproduced in less than 50% bootstrap replicates are collapsed. The tree is drawn to scale, with branch lengths measured in the number of substitutions per site. The number of samples possessing a particular haplotype is given in parenthesis. The underlined haplotypes were detected in the introduced regions Europe (EU), Africa (AF), Asia (AS), Australasia (AU), and North America (NA). tu, haplotypes detected from tuber lesions; ga, haplotypes detected from root galls. GeneBank accession numbers are given for the outgroup species."
