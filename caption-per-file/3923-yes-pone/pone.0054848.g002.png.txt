Relationships in Neoaves.A. Phylogeny based on 1,541 loci from 32 species and an alignment that was 87% complete. B. Phylogeny based on 416 loci in 29 species and an alignment that was 100% complete. A, B. Branch lengths are not shown to permit easier interpretation of the topology (see Fig. 4 for phylogram of 416-locus tree and Fig. S2 for phylogram of 1,541-locus tree). Bayesian trees are shown (nodes <0.90 PP collapsed) with circles on nodes indicating level of support for each node and congruence with the ML trees (see legend in figure). Support is shown for nodes that have less than 1.0 PP or less than 100% ML bootstrap support (PP | ML). If only a bootstrap score is shown (e.g., 46), then PP for that node ?=?1.0. NP?=?node not present in ML tree. Thus, white nodes with no values indicate 1.0 | NP."
