Neighbor joining phylogenetic tree of DNA sequences of gene hp0519. The full hp0519 length (831 bp for most Shimaa strains) was used for each strain included in this tree. This tree shows massive separation of Shimaa hp0519 alleles from those from elsewhere. The distinctiveness of Japanese alleles relative to Korean and European alleles had been documented previously [36]. The origins of H. pylori strains are coded by color and first letters of strain names: Shimaa, green (Shi); Japan, red (J); Korea, pink (K); Spain, blue (S); Peruvian shantytown, black (P). Genome sequenced reference strains from ethnic Europeans are indicated with unfilled circles (B38, P12, HpAG1, G27, 26695, J99). Bar scale indicates 0.02 nucleotide substitutions per site."
