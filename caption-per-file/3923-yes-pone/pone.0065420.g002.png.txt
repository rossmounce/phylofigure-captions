Neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree for GCRPR-related receptors.Human (hu), mouse (mo), chicken (ch), anole lizard (an), Xenopus (xe), zebrafish (zf), medaka (md), fugu (fu), stickleback (sb), and tetraodon (to) along with human SCTR, GHRHR, VIPRs, and ADCYAP1R1 were examined. The amino acid sequences were aligned on ClustalX-2.1, and a tree was constructed with MEGA 5.05. Bootstrap numbers represent 1,000 replicates."
