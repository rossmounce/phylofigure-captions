"pone.0062799.g003.png","Phylogeny of rRNA gene sequences.The longest rRNA consensus sequence assembled from the Neanderthal data and assigned to Streptmycetales is shown in red (SSU_Streptomycetales C11). The rRNA gene sequences amplified from the cave sediment are shown in green colour. Streptomyces coelicolor, used as a reference in the alignment is shown in blue. The PCR-amplified sequences from the cave sediment are shown in green. “ACT primers clone A5_G07” refer to amplifications with the actinobacterial-specific primers, while the four sequences obtained from the universal primers 27f and 1492r are referred to as “universal primers clone u2_C02, 05, 08 and 09″. The phylogeny was inferred using the maximum likelihood method. Numbers refer to bootstrap support values higher than 75%."
