"pone.0052413.g002.png","Melanopsin gene tree and the syntenic analyses in the melanopsin genomic paralogon.A. The phylogenetic analyses were retrieved with maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods and the support values for each method (bootstrap and posterior probability, respectively) are shown on the main nodes. The main duplication events that characterize melanopsin gene history are represented with yellow (2R) or green (3R) circles on the respective nodes. B. Paralogous genes are represented with the same color code (LDB3/PDLIM5 and BMPR1A/BMPR1B). The red cross represents the gene loss in the mammalian OPN4x."
