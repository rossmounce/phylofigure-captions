Maximum likelihood phylogeny of known Papaver S-alleles and putative S-alleles from other taxa. The Papaver S-alleles (alleles PrsS1, PrsS3 PrsS8 and PnSn1 in bold) identified by [5] and [6] form highly divergent lineages that include recently identified sequences from P. mcconnellii but show no close associations with any non-Papaver sequences. All sequences from P. californicus form a distinct monophyletic clade while sequences from A. munita and R. coulteri show some poorly supported shared polymorphism. P. californicus linked sequences S2d and S2e from parental plant 2 are found in separate sub-clades as are co-inherited sequences S3a and S3b from parent 3 (italics). Sequences used in crosses for A. munita and P. californicus are indicated as text."
