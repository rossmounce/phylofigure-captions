Relationship of chondrichthyan species.Species tree illustrating the relationship of all chondrichthyan species employed in our analyses, either in the divergence time study or evolutionary rate analysis (see text for alternative views of the phylogenetic relationship). Circles indicate the nodes referred to in the divergence time analysis. Widths of triangles are proportional to the numbers of species for individual groups according to Compagno et al. [69]."
