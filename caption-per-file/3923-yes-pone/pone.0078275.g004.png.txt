"pone.0078275.g004.png","Neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree constructed with anammox bacteria hzo-deduced amino acid sequences from the oxygen minimum zone (OMZ) in Costa Rica Dome (CRD).The sequences in bold were obtained in the present study. The sequences were grouped at a 1% cutoff value using DOTUR and only one sequence was selected to represent the operational taxonomic unit (OTU). The number in the brackets followed the sequence name indicated the number of the clones recovered. Bootstrap resampling was performed 1000 times and only its values higher than 50% are shown. The scale bar presents the number of amino acid substitutions per site."
