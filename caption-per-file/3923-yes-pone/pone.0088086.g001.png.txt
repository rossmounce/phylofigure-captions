Cloning and characterization of zebrafish Lin-28a and Lin-28b.A. Deduced amino acid sequences of zebrafish Lin-28a and Lin-28b aligned against human, mouse and c.elegans Lin28 homologs. Blue boxes represent identical and similar amino acids. The characteristic Lin28 structure including cold-shock domain and two CCHC-Zn finger domains was highly conserved in zebrafish Lin-28a and Lin-28b. B. The phylogeny of the Lin28 family based on the alignment of full length of amino acid sequence. The branch length (X axis) in the rectangular cladogram represent the distances among those sequences calculated using BLOSUM62 substitution matrix."
