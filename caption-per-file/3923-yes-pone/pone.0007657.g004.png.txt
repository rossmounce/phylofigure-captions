"pone.0007657.g004.png","Phylogenetic tree of 18S rRNA gene sequences for Prasinophyceae retrieved from PPEs sorted by flow cytometry in the South East Pacific (in bold blue) inferred by ML analysis.Sequences representative of OTUs are labelled with a dot. 888 positions of an alignment of 85 partial sequences were used. The phylogenetic tree was based on a TrN+I+G model of DNA substitution with a gamma distribution shape parameter of 0.5547 and substitution rates of R(b)[A–G] = 2.3180, R(e)[C–T] = 4.9754 and 1.0 for all other substitution rates. Total number of rearrangements tried was 75,853. Bootstrap values over 50% are indicated on the internal branches obtained from both NJ and MP methods."
