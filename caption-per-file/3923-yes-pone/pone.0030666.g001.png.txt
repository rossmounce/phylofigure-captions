"pone.0030666.g001.png","Phylogenetic tree of 23 Malagasy dialects realized by Unweighted Pair Group Method Average (UPGMA). In this figure the name of the dialect is followed by the name of the town where it was collected. The phylogenetic tree shows a main partition of the Malagasy dialects into four main groups associated with different colors. The strict correspondence of this cladogram with the geography can be appreciated by comparison with Fig. 2."
