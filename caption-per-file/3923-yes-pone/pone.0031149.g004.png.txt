"pone.0031149.g004.png","Phylogenetic relationship of HD-ZIP III subfamily from eight plant species. Enlarged view of the phylogeny of HD-ZIP III members from Figure 1A. Numbers at each branch indicate bootstrap values and only values higher than 50% are shown. Scale bar corresponds to the estimated number of amino acid substitutions per site. Filled circles represent HD-ZIP proteins from different plant species. Colors correspond to plant taxa as indicated in Figure 1."
