"pone.0019308.g006.png","Schematic illustrating lineage-specific events in KAP-Î² family evolution. Proposed positions of origin and secondary loss are shown on a schematic eukaryotic phylogeny, representing five major supergroups. Dots indicate expansions and losses; note the position in an internode is arbitrary, and only events that are shared by more than one taxon are shown. TNPO3 is proposed to have undergone an ancestral duplication (A and B) followed by loss in the lineage leading to the modern Excavata. Note that the more recently accepted SAR supergroup, encompasing stramenopiles, alveolates and Rhizaria is used here. Figure adapted from [90]."
