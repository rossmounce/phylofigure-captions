"pone.0031264.g007.png","S-ELF3 in Fagopyrum species. The gene structure and phylogeny of S-ELF3 in five Fagopyrum species, including the SC Kyushu PL4 line, which contains the Sh allele of F. homotropicum, are shown. Species in blue and red font exhibit heteromorphic SI and homomorphic SC, respectively. Dark brown boxes and lines represent 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions and introns, respectively. Coding regions are colored blue. Red boxes and line indicate large insertions (>400 bp) and nonsense mutation, respectively. The phylogenetic tree in the inset was obtained by the Neighbor-joining method. The S-ELF3 sequence from F. urophyllum was used as an outgroup. The bootstrap numbers (500 replicates) are shown next to the branches. The scale bar corresponds to 0.02 substitution per nucleotide site."
