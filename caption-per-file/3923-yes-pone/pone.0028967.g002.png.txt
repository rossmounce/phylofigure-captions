"pone.0028967.g002.png","Putative phylogenetic origins of three environmental Glycoside Hydrolases belonging to families GH7 (A) and GH45 (B). Bayesian (MrBayes) phylogenetic trees include protein sequences from different taxonomic groups, each identified by a specific colour. Diagrams drawn to scale illustrate the modular structure of each of the different GH45 protein sequences. Red rectangles, potential signal peptides; blue rectangles, GH45 domains used for the phylogenetic analysis; orange rectangles, family one Carbohydrate Binding Modules (CBM1) characteristic of fungal GH45; purple rectangle, CBM2 module only found in the environmental sequence. Boxed species names indicate protein sequences for which an endoglucanase catalytic activity has been experimentally established [30]â€“[33]. Posterior branch probabilities above 0.8 are given; branches with less than 0.5 probability support were collapsed."
