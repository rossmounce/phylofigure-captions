"pone.0068681.g006.png","Phylogenetic analysis of SM prteins from Verticillium and other fungal species.The entire amino acid sequences of SM proteins of Verticillium and other fungi were aligned using Clustal X and the MP phylogenetic tree was constructed using PhyML package with kimura model under 100 replications of bootstrap analysis. Separate clades are indicated by vertical bars, branch times values were given. Dictyostelium discoideum Sec1-like (DDB0238598) was used as an outgroup."
