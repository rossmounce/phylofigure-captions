Phylogenetic analysis of the 12 elephant V位 genes. A phylogenetic tree of the nucleotide sequences of the 12 elephant V位 segments was constructed. The 12 elephant V位 gene segments belong to six families, which are clustered with the human V位 1, 3, 4, 7, 9, and 10 families, respectively. The credibility value for each node is shown."
