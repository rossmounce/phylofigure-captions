"pone.0046695.g005.png","Rooted neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree of Gammaproteobacteria involved in DIC assimilation obtained from 16S rRNA gene clone libraries of 13C fractions from SIP experiments conducted at NH-10 in September 2008, March 2009, and May 2010.Clones representing highly similar OTUS were collapsed for clarity. Shaded clades represent those identified by Swan et al., 2012 to contain RubisCo and possibly participate in dark carbon fixation."
