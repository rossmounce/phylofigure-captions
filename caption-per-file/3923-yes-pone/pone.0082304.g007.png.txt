MCC trees of 2a and 6a clusters estimated under the model of Bayesian skyline plot model combinations.The MCC phylogenetic trees for Heyuan 2a cluster (A) and 6a cluster (B) were constructed under the best model combination tested. Branches are colored according to their respective geographic origins: (A). Heyuan 2a cluster, red; China, blue; Japan, green; United States, brown; Spain, Cyan; Denmark, magenta. (B). Heyuan 6a cluster, red; China, blue; Hong Kong, magenta; Vietnam, green. Scaled line indicates the different corresponding years the branches originated."
