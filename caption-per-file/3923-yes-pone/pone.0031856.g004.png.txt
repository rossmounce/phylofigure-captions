"pone.0031856.g004.png","Bayesian phylogenetic tree of fungal and bacterial FHbs. Bayesian tree based on a T-COFFEE 9.01 alignment of the globin domains of 55 representative fungal FHbs and 54 representative bacterial FHbs. Support values at branches represent Bayesian posterior probabilities (>0.5). All the bacterial FHbs are in the blue boxes. The sequences are identified by the first three letters of the binary species name, the number of residues, and the full phylum and family names (see Table S1). Sac â€“ Saccharomycetes."
