"pone.0082348.g002.png","The reconstructed spatiotemporal diffusion of SCSK at different time points from 1860 to 2013.Black lines show a spatial projection of a representative phylogeny, with each node being mapped to its known (external node) or estimated (internal node) location. In each panel colored clouds (cumulative, in different colors for each state) represent statistical uncertainty in the estimated locations of the SCSK lineages (95% HPD regions). In the last panel (2013), white circles indicate isolate sampling locations."
