"pone.0080822.g002.png","Patellazoles-containing L. patella animals form a distinct, divergent clade that may include several cryptic species.Cytochrome c oxidase I (COXI) gene nucleotide sequences from various L. patella animals were aligned and used to construct a phylogenetic tree. COXI sequences from other didemnid ascidians and Ciona intestinalis are included as an outgroup and for comparison, and were obtained from the NCBI database (see Materials and Methods). Animals containing patellazoles are highlighted in yellow, “Group A” is shown in blue and “Group B” is shown in magenta [13]."
