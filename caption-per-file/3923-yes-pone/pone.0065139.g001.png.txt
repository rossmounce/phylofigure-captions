Scheme of the OsGL1-6 gene and phylogenic analysis of OsGL1-6-related proteins.(A) Genomic organization of OsGL1-6 gene. The closed black boxes indicate exons, connecting lines indicate introns, and closed white boxes indicate the 5′ and 3′ untranslated region. The ATG start codon and TGA stop codon are also indicated. p1 and p2 are the primers used in the semi-quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis of the OsGL1-6 transcript. p3 and p4 are the primers used to amplify the antisense fragment. p5 and p6 are the primers used to amplify the intact ORF. (B) Phylogenic analysis of proteins homologous to OsGL1-6. The coding region sequences were aligned using Clustal W [51] and subjected to neighbor-joining analysis as implemented in MEGA5.0 [52].
