"pone.0022010.g001.png","Experimental time line and phylogenetic analysis of Env of immunogen and challenge virus. (A) Experimental design. Groups 1 and 2 were vaccinated with HIV-1 Tat, HIV1084i gp160, and Gag-Pol particles from either SIVmne (Group 1) or SIVmac239 (Group 2; 100 µg of each immunogen i.m. in incomplete Freund's adjuvant (IFA)); Group 3 controls received IFA alone. Maximally 5 weekly low-dose i.r. challenges of SHIV-1157ipEL-p were given (8,000 50% tissue culture infectious doses (TCID50, measured by TZM-bl assay). SHIV-1157ipEL-p is heterologous to HIV1084i Env and SIVmne Gag-Pol immunogens. Group 4, unvaccinated rhesus monkeys (RM) challenged identically with the same virus stock as part of other studies. All RM with no viremia at week 7 (shown in red) were rechallenged i.r. with a single high-dose of SHIV-1157ipEL-p (1.5×105 TCID50; red arrows). Group 5: naïve controls for the high-dose challenge. *, Mamu A*001-positive RM. (B) Phylogenetic analysis of Env sequences of immunogen and challenge virus. HIV-1 Env sequences of clade C and non-clade C reference strains were obtained from the Los Alamos HIV-1 sequence database. The evolutionary tree was inferred using the Neighbor-Joining method [47] by MEGA4 software [48]. The immunogen and challenge virus sequences were on different branches within cluster of HIV-C Env sequences."
