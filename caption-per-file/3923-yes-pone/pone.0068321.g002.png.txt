"pone.0068321.g002.png","Nucleic acid phylogenetic tree based on the VP3/VP1 conjunction region.The phylogenetic analyses were conducted in MEGA5 by using the Neighbor-Joining method. The p-distance method was applied to compute the evolutionary distances. LV was used as outgroup. A bootstrap test was replicated 1000 times and only the bootstrap values >70 are displayed. The reference strains are shown with their individual GenBank accession number and corresponding genotype."
