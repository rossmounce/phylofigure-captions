"pone.0025848.g001.png","Phylogenetic tree of the HA of influenza A(H1N1)2009 strains. The strains included were identified in Finland during two epidemic seasons, 2009–10 and 2010–2011. Some representative viruses from other parts of the world are included for comparison. All sequences included in the phylogenetic tree constitute the entire 1698 nucleotide long coding region of HA. The horizontal lines are proportional to the number of nucleotide changes. The phylogenetic tree was constructed using the Neighbor-Joining method with Mega software version 4. Viruses used in HI tests are marked with yellow boxes. Signature amino acid changes are indicated with the colors which represent different antigenic epitopes of HA (Sa in red, Sb in blue, Ca1 in dark green, Ca2 in lighter green and Cb in orange). Amino acid changes marked in black do not locate in expected antigenic epitopes."
