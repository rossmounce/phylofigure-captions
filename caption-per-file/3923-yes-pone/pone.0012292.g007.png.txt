"pone.0012292.g007.png","Phylogenetic relationships of Utahceratops gettyi n. gen et n. sp., and Kosmoceratops richardsoni n. gen. et n. sp. within Ceratopsidae.Strict consensus of 3 most parsimonious trees (tree length  = 263; CI = 0.669; RI = 0.790; RC = 0.529) of an analysis of 148 characters across 7 non-chasmosaurines and 18 chasmosaurines (more than doubling number of characters and taxa relative to any previous analysis of clade). Outgroup taxa and centrosaurines have been collapsed for clarity. Species durations based on first and last documented stratigraphic occurrences correlated where possible to radiometric dates. Solid bars denote species durations known with high degree of confidence. Striped bars denote species durations known with lesser degree of confidence. Solid bars overlaying striped bars indicate that the stratigraphic context of some specimens of the indicated taxon is well established (solid bar) whereas that of others is not (striped bar). Taxa listed in dark green were recovered from the northern portion of the Western Interior; taxa listed in light green are from the southern WIB. See Text S1 for further results of the phylogenetic analysis, including Bremer support and bootstrap values. Stratigraphic data based on Roberts et al. [29] and Sampson and Loewen [12]."
