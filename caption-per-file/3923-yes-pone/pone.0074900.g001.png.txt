Phylogenetic Analysis of the 37 study entry samples (six digit number, two letters) with HBV pol sequence results and Genbank reference sequences (accession number genotype) at baseline.From this tree 32 sequences cluster with the reference genotype A sequences, four cluster with the genotype D reference sequences and one with the genotype E reference sequences. Bootstrap values on the tree referred to how rooted the phylogenetic tree is at the branch i.e. level of confidence. Note that samples identified as occult HBV infection are excluded from this analysis. 37 isolates were sequenced at baseline, one isolate was sequenced after baseline and was thus not included in the tree."
