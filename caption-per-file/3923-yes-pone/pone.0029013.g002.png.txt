Sequence variation recovered by cloning vs. DGGE screening. (a) Unrooted maximum parsimony of sequence variants recovered from the process of bacterial cloning/sequencing of ITS2 rDNA from four samples of C31/C31c (h2â€“h5) and one sample of type C26a (h1) from a subset of samples presented in Figure 1 (b) A corresponding and highly simplified phylogeny based on screening the numerically dominant sequence variants using DGGE fingerprinting. Clones from each sample were color coordinated for comparison and apply to other figures throughout the text."
