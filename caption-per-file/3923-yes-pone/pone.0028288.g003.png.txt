Phylogenetic relationships of the (A) HA and (B) PB2-PB1-PA-NP-NA-MP-NS concatenated sequences of influenza A (H1N1) 2009 viruses circulating from May 2009 to April 2011. The phylogenetic trees were constructed using the neighbor-joining method with 1000 bootstrap replications. Branch values of more than 70 are indicated. The genome sequences obtained from the NCBI database of the 6 early viral isolates collected before May 30, 2009 in Taiwan, A/Taiwan/T0724/2009, A/Taiwan/T0826/2009, A/Taiwan/T1338/2009, A/Taiwan/T1339/2009, A/Taiwan/T1773/2009, and A/Taiwan/T1821/2009, as well as the current vaccine strain, A/California/7/2009, are included as reference sequences. The classification of specific evolutionary clades is indicated."
