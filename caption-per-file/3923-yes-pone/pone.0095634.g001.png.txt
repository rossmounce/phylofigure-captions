Protein sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis of VvARF7 and VvARF8.(A) Schematic diagrams of VvARF7 and VvARF8. The length of each protein is denoted. DBD, B3 DNA-binding domain; MR, middle region; III, Aux/IAA dimerization domain III; IV, Aux/IAA dimerization domain IV. (B) Phylogenetic tree of Vitis ARF7 and ARF8 with Arabidopsis and tomato ARF families. Asterisks indicate previously reported SlARF7 and SlARF8 proteins, numbered SlARF9 and SlARF4 [46], respectively, based on their locations on the chromosome."
