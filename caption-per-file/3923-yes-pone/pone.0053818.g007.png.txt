"pone.0053818.g007.png","Phylogenomic tree and heatmap analyses of the Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis strains based on pathogenicity island plasticity.Comparisons between the PAI contents of all the strains were plotted as percentages of similarity on the heatmap using Gegenees (version 1.1.4). The percentages of similarity were used to generate a phylogenomic tree with SplitsTree (version 4.12.6). Numbers from 1 to 15 (upper-left to upper-right corner) represent the strains from Cp1002 to Cp1/06-A (upper-left to lower-left corner). On the heatmap, the upper portion is not symmetrical to the lower portion because the pathogenicity islands contents of all genomes present different sizes. Therefore, considering a scenario where the pathogenicity islands content from genomes A and B are composed of 100 and 80 genes, respectively, with a common repertoire of 40 genes, genome A will present 40% of similarity to genome B and genome B will present 50% of similarity to genome A."
