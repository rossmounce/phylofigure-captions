"pone.0078860.g001.png","Phylogenetic tree of Vitis ABC proteins.The amino sequences of all Vitis ABC proteins were aligned using the ClustalW program and were subjected to phylogenetic analysis by the distance with neighbor-joining method. The reliabilities of each branch point, as assessed by the analysis of 1000 computer-generated trees (bootstrap replicates), were in excess of 90%, except for those discussed in the text. The Human Genome Organization (HUGO) nomenclature was used, and the abbreviations of ABC proteins are as follows: ATH, ABC-two-homolog; ATM, ABC transporter of mitochondria; GCN, general control non-repressible; MDR, multi-drug resistance; MRP, multi-drug resistanceâ€“associated protein; NAP, non-intrinsic ABC protein; PDR, pleiotropic drug resistance; PMP, peroxisomal membrane protein; RLI, RNase L inhibitor; SMC, structural maintenance of chromosome; TAP, transporter associated with antigen processing; WBC, white-brown complex. ATH belongs to the ABCA subfamily; MDR, TAP, and ATM belong to the ABCB subfamily; MRP belongs to the ABCC subfamily; PMP belongs to the ABCD subfamily; RLI belongs to the ABCE subfamily; GCN belongs to the ABCF subfamily; and WBC belongs to the ABCG subfamily, as described in the text."
