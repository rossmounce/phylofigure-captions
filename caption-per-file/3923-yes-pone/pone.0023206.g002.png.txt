Phylogenetic analysis based on the 510-nucleotide 3C gene. This phylogenetic tree was constructed by the neighbor joining method using the Kimura-two parameter model from MEGA4 software, with 1000 replicates. Thirty-seven Brazilian isolates of CA24v were compared to strains reported from other countries in previous years available in GenBank. Only bootstrap values >70% are shown at the node. Geometric shapes indicate the years of the Brazilian isolates."
