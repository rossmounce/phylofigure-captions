"pone.0076809.g004.png","Phylogenetic tree of all Dof domain containing proteins from soybean, Arabidopsis, and rice.The deduced full-length amino-acid sequences of 78 soybean, 36 Arabidopsis and 30 rice Dof genes were aligned by Clustal X 1.83 and the phylogenetic tree was constructed using MEGA 4.0 by the neighbor-joining method with 1,000 bootstrap replicates. Each Dof subgroup is indicated by a specific color."
