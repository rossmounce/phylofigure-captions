"pone.0005162.g003.png","Schematic tree illustrating currently accepted phylogenetic relationships among euglenozoan taxa examined in this study.The presence of EFL (red) and EF-1α (blue) are traced along the organismal phylogeny to their origins with solid lines where there is phylogenetic evidence for their monophyly. Dotted lines hypothetically trace the presence of EFL back to the ancestor of Euglenozoa. Taxa shown in white text on black background encode EFL; all others encode EF-1α."
