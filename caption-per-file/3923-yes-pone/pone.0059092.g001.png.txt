"pone.0059092.g001.png","Phylogenetic analysis of RBM4 proteins.A phylogenetic tree of various metazoan RBM4 orthologs was created with the Clustal X program based on alignment of their full-length amino acid sequences. Branch lengths are drawn to scale, and weights for each RBM4 homolog sequence are given; a value of 0.01 represents a difference of 1% between two sequences. Each colored bracket indicates a group of species, in which RBM4 orthologs/homologs contain recognizable domains (RRM or zinc-finger; blue), the potential phosphorylation site RD/ERSP (red), or low-complexity sequences (brown). Detailed information for the low-complexity sequences is shown in Figure 2."
