Evolutionary relationships of arsC sequences.A total of 48 nucleotide sequences and 352 sites were analyzed. The phylogeny was reconstructed by maximum likelihoodand TrN+I+G+F was selected as best fit model. Support values for each node were estimated using the Akaike Likelihood Ratio Test (aLRT). Only support values higher than 70% are shown. Reference sequences retrieved from the non-redundant database of the NCBI are shown in black, bacterial isolates (MS-AsIII and MS-AsV)in green, and operational taxonomic unities (OTUs) from As gene clone librariesin blue. Different background colors highlight Actinobacteria and three Proteobacteria classes â€“ Gamma-, Beta, and alpha-proteobacteria."
