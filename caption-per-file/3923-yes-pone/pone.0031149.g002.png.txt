Phylogenetic relationship of HD-ZIP I subfamily from eight plant species. Expanded view of the phylogeny of HD-ZIP I members from Figure 1A. Numbers at each branch indicate bootstrap values and only values higher than 50% are shown. Scale bar corresponds to the estimated number of amino acid substitutions per site. Filled circles represent HD-ZIP proteins from different plant species with colors corresponding to plant taxa as indicated in Figure 1."
