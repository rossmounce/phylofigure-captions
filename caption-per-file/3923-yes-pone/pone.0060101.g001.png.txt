Neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree of partial gag gene from recently infected individuals confirmed by BED-CEIA.A, Neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree for 120 gag sequences and relative reference sequences. B and C, CRF08_BC and CRF07_BC clusters from the phylogenetic tree shown in A. The scale bar indicates 5% nucleotide sequence divergence. Values on the branches represent the percentage of 1000 bootstrap replicates and bootstrap values over 70% are shown in the tree."
