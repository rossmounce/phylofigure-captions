Phylogenetic analysis of the G gene of HRSV isolates. A phylogenetic tree was built by the neighbor-joining method in MEGA version 5 based on the sequence of the whole G ORF from HRSV isolates. Reference sequences for each subtype, A2 and B1, were also included. All HRSV isolates were labeled by the year of isolation and the order of sampling. The numbers at the branch nodes indicate the bootstrap value. Bootstrap values were calculated with 1000 replicates. The scale bar represents the percentage of nucleotide changes."
