"pone.0018348.g001.png","Maximum parsimony tree of 45 entire mtDNA genomes of patients suffering Ras/MAPK pathway syndromes. The mutations are displayed along branches; the variant nomenclature is refered to was taken from the rCRS [30]. All mutations are transitions unless a suffix specifies a transversion (A, C, G, T), a deletion (d), an insertion (+), a synonymous substitution (s), a mutational change in tRNA (-t), a mutational change in rRNA (-r), stop codon (-stp), non-coding variant located in the mtDNA coding region (-nc) or amino acid replacement (indicated in round brackets). Recurrent mutational events are underlined. A prefix indicates a back mutation (@) or a position that is located in an overlapping region shared by two genes (*). Several mutational hotspot variants were not considered for phylogenetic reconstruction and therefore were eliminated from the tree; these included variants at the homopolymeric tracks around position 310, the microsatellite at m.523–524 d (aka m.522–523 d), the transversion m.16182A>C, m.16183A>C, m.16193+1C(C), m.16519T>C, and length or point heteroplasmies. Codes of the samples are indicated in colored circles at the terminal branches of the phylogeny: green indicates a mutation on gene SOS1, orange indicates a mutation on PTPN11, yellow indicates a mutation on KRAS, grey indicates lack of mutations on genes SOS1, PTPN11, KRAS, and RAF, and white indicates that data is not available for that sample."
