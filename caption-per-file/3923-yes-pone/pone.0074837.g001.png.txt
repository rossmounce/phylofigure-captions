Partitioned Bayesian phylogeny of Costa Rican Heterospilus based on 5 loci.The large tree is an ultrametric post-convergence chronogram inferred in BEAST, and the small inset phylogram shows branch lengths from a similar analysis in MrBayes. Edge width represents node posterior probability. Heterospilus is inferred to be paraphyletic. All taxa in the shaded rectangle- including the non-Heterospilus- were used for subsequent character evolution analyses."
