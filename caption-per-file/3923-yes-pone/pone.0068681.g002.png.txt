"pone.0068681.g002.png","Phylogenetic analysis of Qa-SNAREs from Verticillium and other fungal species.The entire amino acid sequences of Qa-SNARE proteins of Verticillium and other fungi were aligned using Clustal X and the MP phylogenetic tree was constructed using PhyML package with kimura model amino acid substitution model under 100 replicates of bootstrap analysis. Separate clades are indicated by vertical bars, branch times values were given and the orthologs in different filamentous fungi appeared to cluster together. Qa-type Syx18 of Encephalitozoon cuniculi was used as an outgroup. Fungal species are following: Sc, Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Vd, Verticillium dahlia; Va, Verticillium albo-atrum; Fo, Fusarium oxysporum; Fv, Fusarium verticillioides; Fg, Fusarium graminearum; Ss, Sclerotinia sclerotiorum; Mg, Magnaporthe oryzae; Ao, Aspergillus oryzae."
