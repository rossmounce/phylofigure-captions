Model for TRIMCyp evolution in Old World primates.Schematic dendrogram showing the history of TRIMCyp evolution inferred here, in the context of established phylogenetic relationships among Old World primate species studied. Filled star, evolution of TRIMCyp. Open star, fixation of TRIMCyp. Asian macaque phylogenetic groups are indicated at right [23]. This graphical representation is not to scale and is not intended to reflect relative divergence. Relationships are adapted from [23], [29], [37]."
