Inferred phylogeny of Tylos in the study area, based on the concatenated mitochondrial+nuclear loci.Majority-rule consensus tree (RaxML bootstrap). Colors and shapes correspond to clades in Fig. 1. Numbers by nodes indicate the corresponding range of Bootstrap Support (BS; top or left) for Maximum likelihood (RaxML, Garli, PartitionFinder); and Posterior Probabilities (PP; bottom or right) for Bayesian inference methods (MrBayes, Phycas, BayesPhylogenies), including all partitioning schemes. * denotes nodes that received 100% support for all methods. Nodes receiving less than 50% support for all methods were collapsed and denoted with <50. â€ : relationship based on 16S sequence only: Isla Angel de la Guarda."
