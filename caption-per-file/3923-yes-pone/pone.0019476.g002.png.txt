Bayesian phylogeny of 102 cytochrome b haplotypes, with main clades marked. Haplotype numbers are given (E1–106), followed by the site types represented (P = pond, L = lake, R = river, S = sea), and the number of such sites in brackets. Posterior probabilities >0.7 are indicated at the major nodes, and major clades are labelled. The outgroup is labelled by its accession number (GU227782), and is a previously published nine-spined stickleback sequence from Japan."
