Neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree from analysis of ecp upstream region of APEC strains.Phylogenetic relationships between nucleotide sequences of putative ecp promoter sequences (−603 bp to −1 bp from the start codon GTG of ecpR) of APEC strains sequenced in this study (n = 40) or those available on public database (n = 7) [APEC-O1 (NC_008563.1); BEN374 (JN377377); BEN79 (JN377376); 789 (JN377380), APEC-O78 (NC_020163.1), χ7122 (NZ_HE962388.1), IMT2125 (NZ_HE964769)]. Eleven related sequences of human pathogenic and non-pathogenic E. coli [(DH1 (CP001637), UMN026 (CU928163.1), TW14359 (CP001368), SMS-3-5 (CP000970), CB9615 (CP001846), CFT073 (NC_004431.1), E2348/69 (FM180568.1), E24377A (CP000800), BL21(DE3) (NC_012892.2), 55989 (CU928145.2), 11368 (AP010953)] and one sequence of Shigella boydii Sb227 (NR_076357.1) were included as controls and the sequence of Klebsiella pneumoniae Ec18 (NZ_HF536482.1) was used as outgroup. Results of ECP expression of APEC strains tested in biofilm or in contact with HeLa cells are shown on the right. Colored dots represent phylogenetic groups, Green (A), Blue (B1), Red (B2), Yellow (D), and Purple (E). Abbreviations: NS, non-specific; NT, non-typable; ND, not determined."
