Abundance of the dominant bacterial OTUs in the fecal samples of subjects throughout the study.All OTUs that had an average proportion >0.2% were included. Representative sequences of OTUs were used to construct the Maximum Likelihood phylogenetic tree, which is colored-coded according to phylum: Bacteroidetes (orange), Actinobacteria (magenta), Firmicutes (blue), Verrucomicrobia (green). The abundance of each phylotype is indicated by grayscale. The OTU numbers are presented to the right of the heatmap."
