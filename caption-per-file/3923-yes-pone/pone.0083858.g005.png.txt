"pone.0083858.g005.png","The phylogenetic topology tree for functional divergence and natural selection pressures tests in Data Set 1.Numbers adjacent to nodes represent ancestral FoxP2, FoxP2a and FoxP2b. Forkhead domain evolutionary changes between neighboring nodes are listed above the branches. The filled square under a branch indicates that the gene has undergone positive selection in the evolutionary status; the blank square represents that the gene has experienced accelerated evolution."
