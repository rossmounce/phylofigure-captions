ML phylogenetic tree of HIV-1 subtype C pol (?1000 pb) sequences circulating in Cuba (n?=?49), and in central (n?=?53), eastern (n?=?330) and southern (n?=?545) African countries.Branches are colored according to the origin of each sequence, as indicated at the legend (bottom left). The circular bracket highlights the position of the subtype C east African clade (CEA). Shaded boxes highlight the position of the two major HIV-1 subtype C Cuban clades (CCU-I and CCU-II). Key nodes with aLRT support values >0.80 (*) and ?0.90 (**) are indicated. The tree was rooted using HIV-1 subtype A1 and D reference sequences (gray branches). The branch lengths are drawn to scale with the bar at the bottom indicating nucleotide substitutions per site."
