VZV phylogeny. Phylogenetic network (splits network) of available complete genome VZV sequences. The strains are divided into clades 1 to 5, and the deep lineage reticulate topology is caused by a few ancient recombination events described previously. The network also presents a reticulate pattern within clade 1 caused by a putative recent recombination event involving strain SVETA."
