The phylogenetic tree analysis of R. sativus unigenes.The phylogenetic trees of U2AF35 and GIGANTEA unigenes in multiple plants were constructed using the neighbor-joining method. The Brassicaceae plants were denoted with red. Accordingly, (A) the U2AF35 unigene and (B) the GIGANTEA unigene of R. sativus were both marked with green square."
