Evolutionary branches of the GH13 amylolytic enzymes from 85 fungi and their structure features.A. The inner circle was the phylogenetic tree of the GH13 amylolytic enzymes from 85 fungal genomes and the root was put at the mid-point of the longest span across the tree. The tree was inferred by FastTree from the alignments of GH13 amylolytic enzymes constructed by HMMER packages against the profile hidden Markov model of PF00128 and edited on iTOL. The bootstrap values at the inner nodes are displayed by the color that the related edges are marked in red with the values less than 800 in 1000 replicates and otherwise maintain in dark. The outer is the taxon represented as species abbreviation (shown in Table? 1) followed by the serial number, which is covered by different colors to show its taxonomic group as the legend indicated. Each taxon links the branch with a dotted line. Distribution of putative starch-binding domains is indicated by the scattered solid circles outside the corresponding taxon. B. Primary and secondary structure features of four clades. The consensus logos of four clades were generated by Jalview from matched residues in their alignments against the profile hidden Markov model of PF00128. In the logo, the total stack height represented the information content of amino acids at that position. The relative height of each amino acid in the stack was proportional to its frequency at the position and amino acids were sorted so the most common one was on top of the stack. Secondary structures of four consensus sequences were automatically predicted by Jpred Server embedded in Jalview that helices were marked as red tubes and sheets as dark green arrows."
