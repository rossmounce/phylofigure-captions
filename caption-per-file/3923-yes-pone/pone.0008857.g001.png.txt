"pone.0008857.g001.png","Deletion mutants and expression of acs-20 and acs-22.(A) The phylogenic tree of FATPs among human and C. elegans was constructed using ClustalW (http://align.genome.jp). The sequences of a strongly conserved region corresponding to amino acids 246–556 in human FATP1 [14] were compared. The scale bar represents the evolutionary distance. (B) Schematic structures of genes and deletion mutations. (C) Body size of mutants and a rescue line. acs-20 (tm3232); acs-22(tm3236);tmEx1920[Pacs-20::acs-20::egfp] was used as the rescue line. The body length of the animals (n = 50-64) was measured for each strain. Error bars indicate the mean ± SEM. ***P"
