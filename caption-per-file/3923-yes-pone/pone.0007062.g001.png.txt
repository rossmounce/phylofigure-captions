Recent morphological (A) and combined morphological molecular (B) hypotheses of artiodactylan phylogeny.Most cladistic analyses of morphological characters have supported monophyly of extant terrestrial artiodactylans, traditionally called Artiodactyla, as well as the subclades Suiformes and Selenodontia. Note the variable placements of the enigmatic extinct groups †Raoellidae and †Mesonychia in the different topologies. The deeply nested conflict between phylogenetic hypotheses for Artiodactyla is shown very well by these two recent studies: for the major lineages shown, no clades are shared. Lineages that connect extant taxa in the tree are represented by thick gray branches, and wholly extinct lineages are shown as thin black branches. Illustrations are by C. Buell and L. Betti-Nash."
