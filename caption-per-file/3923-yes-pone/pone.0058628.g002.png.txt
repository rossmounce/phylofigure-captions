"pone.0058628.g002.png","Phylogenetic lineage of Acinetobacter baumannii.The phylogenetic relationship of all completely sequenced A. baumannii strains was inferred by the neighbour-joining method conducted in MEGA5 [54] using concatenated nucleotide sequences of six reference genes based on the multilocus sequence tag scheme of A. baumannii (cpn60, gltA, pyrG, recA, rplB and rpoB). Numerals adjacent to strain names represent the number of unique genes (determined by BLASTP) and the numerals adjacent to the brackets represent the size of the core genome of A. baumannii or within clonal lineages. The interior values are bootstrap probabilities based on 1000 replicates, and the tree was drawn using TreeGraph2 [101]."
