"pone.0057177.g002.png","MtDNA protein phylogeny of seven species belonging to Reinhardtinia clade and three outgroup species from the Volvocales.The tree was constructed under the RAxML (with WAG+I+4G model) method using the concatenated sequences of the deduced nad5, cox1, and cob amino acid sequences. Left, middle, and right bootstrap values (?50%) obtained using the RAxML, PhyML (with LG+I+4G model), and MP analysis, respectively. The amino acid sequences of the three proteins were aligned by Clustal X [29], and ambiguously aligned and highly variable regions were removed to construct a multiprotein data matrix of 909 amino acids from the 10 operational taxonomic units (Table S1)."
