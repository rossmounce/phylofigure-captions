Evolutionary relationships of ICEs within strains of the P. syringae complex.The concatenated sequences of seven proteins (XerC/D tyrosine recombinase, ICE_TraI, DSBA oxoreductase, uvrD helicase, AdoMet-methyl transferase, DnaB and ParA (chromosome partitioning) encoded in the ICEs were used to generate the phylogenetic tree. The data for islands in strains other than those sequenced here were obtained from the accession numbers shown in Table 7. The evolutionary history was inferred using the Neighbour-Joining method in MEGA5 [26]. The optimal tree with the sum of branch length = 0.542 is shown. The percentage of replicate trees in which the associated taxa clustered together in the bootstrap test (1050 replicates) is shown next to the branches."
