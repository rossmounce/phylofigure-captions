Simplified consensus tree showing the genera relationships in Homoscleromorpha based on molecular phylogenies.Morphological characters that are diagnostics of these clades are mapped. I: Absence of spicules in clade A. II: Specific gene arrangement in mitochondrial genome in clade A (see Fig. 4). III: Presence of spicules (lophate and alophate) in clade B. IV: Specific gene arrangement in mitochondrial genome in clade B (see Fig. 4). V: Presence of a candelabra (heterolophose calthrop) specific to Corticium genus, clade B1. VI: Presence of alophose spicules and absence of lophose spicules in clade B2. VII: Presence of tetralophose calthrop and of a well developed mesohyl in clade B3."
