"pone.0091804.g002.png","Sequence alignment and phylogenetic analyses of CsGAIP and related DELLA proteins.(A) Sequence alignment of the 150 amino acid residues of CsGAIP N-terminal with other DELLA proteins. The identical and similar residues are shown in black and gray, respectively. The highly conserved DELLA and VHYNP domains are indicated in black lines. At, Arabidopsis thaliana; Cm, Cucurbita maxima; Cs, Cucumis sativus; Zm, Zea mays; Os, Oryza sativa; Hv, Hordeum vulgare; Ta, Triticum aestivum. (B) Phylogenetic analyses of CsGAIP and related DELLA proteins using MEGA5 software based on the neighbor joining method. Homologs of DELLA from six dicotyledon species (green line) and four monocotyledon species (red line) were used for the analyses and formed distinct clade (dicotyledon group and monocotyledon group). The four DELLA homologs from cucumber are indicated in red boxes. Gene ID for each of the DELLA protein used for this analysis is listed in the “accession numbers”. Ls, Lactuca sativa; Ps, Pisum sativum; Pv, Phaseolus vulgaris."
