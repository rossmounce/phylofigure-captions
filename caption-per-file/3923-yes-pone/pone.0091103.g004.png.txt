Phylogenetic analysis of the replicase domains of pp1ab.Unrooted phylogenies were generated from the protein sequences of the indicated replicase domains using the maximum likelihood method. Bootstrapping replicates (1000) are rounded to a value out of 100. The branch length is proportional to the evolutionary distance as shown by the scale bar (substitutions per amino acid site)."
