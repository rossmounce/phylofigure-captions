ML phylogenetic tree of TBEV strains.The tree was based on the complete genomes of strains inducing diseases of different severity. Pathogenic strains Efd are shown in black, Sfd strains in green and strains with the febrile form of TBEV are shown in red. Prototype strains are shown in blue. Numbers above or below branches indicate posterior node probabilities and bootstrap values from NJ analysis."
