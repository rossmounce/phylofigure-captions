"pone.0065567.g004.png","The phylogenetic distribution and relatedness of the soil bacteria.The 16S rRNA genes were sequenced from all bacteria and the phylogenetic tree was created using these sequences and the ARB program package. Branches of the tree are color coded by bacterial orders, with each line at the branch end representing an individual bacterial isolate. The orders with the largest number of lines indicate the largest number of bacterial members within this study. The relatedness of the orders is defined by the distance from one branch to the next. The unclassified bacteria are therefore, closest to the Pseudomonadales."
