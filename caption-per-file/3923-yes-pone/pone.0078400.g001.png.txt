"pone.0078400.g001.png","Phylogenetic tree analysis of putative Pam18 (A) and Pam16 (B) orthologues from twelve plant species.Both Pam18 (A) and Pam16 (B) phylogenetic trees were generated by the neighbor-joining method and bootstrap values (1000 replications) are indicated at each branch. The unit bar on the tree represents the measure of phylogenetic distance."
