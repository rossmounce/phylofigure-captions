"pone.0021086.g003.png","Estimated ages of the major eusocial insect clades. Colored boxes indicate the time period in which the eusocial members of the clade are estimated to have originated. All estimates are based on fossil calibrated divergence time analyses except for the eusocial Vespidae, which is based on the fossil of a polistine nest from the Late Cretaceous [66]. This fossil provides a minimum age for the origin of eusocial wasps which probably originated sometime in the mid-Cretaceous [67]. Molecular studies, however, have indicated that the eusocial vespids do not form a monophyletic group and instead represent two independent eusocial lineages [84]. There is also uncertainty in the phylogenetic placement of ants relative to bees and vespids. The traditional relationships are depicted here, with ants more closely related to vespids than to bees [85], although a more recent molecular analysis suggests that ants share a more recent common ancestor with bees than vespids [86]. Termites are estimated to have originated sometime between 180 and 230 Mya [70], ants between 115 and 135 Mya [69], corbiculates 87 Mya (78 to 95 Mya), allodapines 53 Mya (41 to 65 Mya), eusocial Halictus (Halict.) 21 Mya (15 to 28 Mya) [71], eusocial Lasioglossum (Lasiogl.) 22 Mya (15 to 29 Mya) [71], and eusocial Augochlorini (Augochl.) 20 Mya (12 to 29 Mya) [71]."
