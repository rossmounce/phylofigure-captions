Summary of the taxonomies proposed for the genus Madascincus using different species delimitation approaches.Correspondences with clades are shown on the mtDNA gene tree (BI analysis of concatenated ND1and 16S sequences, posterior probabilities indicated for each node). The seven vertical multicolored bars represent alternative taxonomies, respectively supported by the Mitochondrial Tree â€“ Morphological character Congruence (MTMC), Integrative Taxonomy (ITAX), Wiens-Penkrot (WP), Bayesian Assignment Test (BAT), Haploweb (HW), Bayesian Species Delimitation (BSD) and Generalized Mixed Yule-Coalescent (GMYC) approaches for species delimitation, each segment of these bars representing distinct species according to the respective approach. White lines connecting different samples in the phylogeny represent instances of sympatry between different clades."
