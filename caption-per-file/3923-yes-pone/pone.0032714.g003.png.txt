"pone.0032714.g003.png","Phylogenetic trees for HIV-1 gag, protease, integrase and env-V3 sequences extracted from VC, VP, and RNA using DPS. Symbols represent unique haplotypes extracted from DPS for subjects P20 ○, P21 ▵, P22 ⋄, and P23 □, according to sample type: VC (light symbols), VP (dark symbols), and RNA (empty symbols). Numbers next to symbols indicate haplotype frequencies obtained from the total reads; only values above 20% are indicated in the figure. Node numbers indicate bootstrap values over 75%. (A) gag maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree based on the TrN model. (B) Integrase maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree based on the HKY model. (C) Protease maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree based on the HKY+ G (α = 0.565) model. (D) env-V3 maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree based on the TrN model."
