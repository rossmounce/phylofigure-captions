PN-SIA28 Neutralizing activity. Influenza hemagglutinin unrooted phylogenetic tree of the different viral strains tested in neutralization assays with PN-SIA28. Viral isolates belonging to group 1 and group 2 are presented in the box B and box A, respectively. A green ‘+’ indicates positive neutralizing activity, a red ‘−’ indicates negative neutralizing activity. As reported in the text, PN-SIA28 is able to neutralize all of the group 1 strains and is also able to neutralize all of the H3N2 isolates spanning 1968 and 1975. *Recombinant HA from (H1N1) A/South Carolina/1/1918 pandemic strain was previously shown to be bound by PN-SIA28 [19], [20]. Analogously, recombinant HA from H5N1 A/Cygnus Olor/Italy/742/2005 was recognized by PN-SIA28 (data not shown). # H1N1 A/New Caledonia/20/1999 was previously shown to be neutralized by PN-SIA28 as Fab fragment [19], [20]."
