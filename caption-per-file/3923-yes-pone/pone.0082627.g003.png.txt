Bootscanning plot of sequences covering the ORF1/2 overlap of GI. 2/GI.6 recombinant HuzhouN11.(A) Bootscanning plot of HuzhouN11 using GI.1 (Norwalk/1968/US), GI.2 (Leuven/2003/BEL), GI.4 (Chiba407/1987/JP), and GI.6 (Hesse3/1997/DE) as subtype references. Dashed vertical lines indicate the start of the capsid gene. (B) Phylogenetic analyses of segment I (3'-ORF1) and segment II (5'-ORF2) defined by bootscanning. The phylogenetic trees were constructed with MEGA 5.0 using the neighbor-joining method. Segment I of HuzhouN11 clustered with the GI.2 subtype reference and segment II of HuzhouN11 clustered with the GI.6 subtype reference."
