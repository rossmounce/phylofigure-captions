"pone.0067415.g001.png","Obst-A and Gasp and their expression.(a, b) Whole-mount in situ hybridization of wild-type embryos with obst-A (a) and gasp (b) probes. obst-A and gasp mRNA are detected in tracheal cells from stage 13 onward. Note the gaps in obst-A expression correspond to the position of the fusion cells (arrowheads). Scale bar: 25 Âµm (c) A phylogenetic tree of Obstructor proteins based on ClustalW method. The number in brackets indicates, which subgroup of the Obstructor family (1 or 2) each gene belongs to. (d) Schematic representation of the Obst-A and Gasp protein domains. N-terminal signal sequence is followed by three chitin-binding domains type 2 (CBD2)."
