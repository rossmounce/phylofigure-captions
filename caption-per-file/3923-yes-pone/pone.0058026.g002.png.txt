Relationship of Wolbachia derived from Ae. albopictus and Ae. aegypti mosquitoes based on 16S ribosomal RNA sequence.Ribosomal RNA sequences were assembled using a reference sequence, and a multiple alignment file was constructed. This was used to calculate a distance matrix and phylogenetic tree using the neighbour joining method. For comparison, Wolbachia 16S ribosomal RNA from field-caught Ae. albopictus (Accession number X61767.1) and D. melanogaster (Accession number AE017196.1) were included, and 16S ribosomal RNA from Rickettsia prowazekii (Accession number NC_017560.1) was used as an out-group. The numbers shown are the bootstrapping values for 1000 replicates."
