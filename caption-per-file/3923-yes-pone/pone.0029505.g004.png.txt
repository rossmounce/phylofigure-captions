"pone.0029505.g004.png","Inferred phylogenetic relationships of herpesviruses detected in siman bushmeat samples. Neighbor-joining (NJ) and maximum-likelihood (ML) analysis gave identical branching orders. Sequences identified in bushmeat products are underlined and cluster with sub-families betaherpesvirus (samples: CII-028, CII-163, BM-002), and gammaherpesvirus (samples: CII-163, CII-013, CII-051, CII-044, CII-144, CII-040, BM-008)."
