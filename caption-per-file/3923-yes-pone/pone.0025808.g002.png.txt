Phylogenetic relationships of PB1 (A), PB2 (B), and PA (C) genes of the BbM viruses and analyzed H9N2 reference viruses. Neighbor-joining phylogenetic trees were generated using the MEGA program. Analysis was based on the following nucleotides: PB1, 229 to 2233; PB2, 52 to 2255; and PA, 58 to 2094. Viruses were labeled using the same way as Figure 1. Virus abbreviations are listed in the legend of Figure 1."
