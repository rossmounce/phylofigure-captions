"pone.0003828.g004.png","Inferred pattern of acquisition or loss of five pathogenesis-associated gene clusters in Xanthomonas.Based on comparison of genome sequences and other data among Xanthomonas strains and the close relatives Xylella fastidiosa and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (see text), an inferred pattern of acquisition or loss of five pathogenesis associated gene clusters during the evolution of different Xanthomonas lineages is shown, superimposed on a phylogenetic tree drawn from an alignment of 16s rRNA gene sequences. Potential horizontal exchange of hrp and rpf sequences affecting the X. axonopodis clade, discussed in the text, is not depicted. Strain abbreviations are as in the text. For X. fastidiosa, the strain 9aâ€“5c sequence was used. For S. maltophilia, the strain K279a sequence was used."
