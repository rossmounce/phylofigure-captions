"pone.0016743.g005.png","Phylogeny of the 64 MJ1 sequences from Ae. aegypti and the hyrcanus group of Anopheles mosquitoes. The unrooted phylogeny was inferred from nucleotide sequence alignment of all 64 MJ1 sequences using MrBayes version 3.1.2 [20]. The evolutionary model used during the Bayesian analysis was selected using JModeltest [29] and 2.5 million generations of analyses were performed to produce the phylogeny and clade credibility scores. Sequence alignment and parameters for phylogenetic analysis are provided in Supplemental File S4 which is an executable Nexus file. Ae. aegypti MJ1 sequences are indicated by their contig names. All other MJ1 sequences are named according to the following convention: The first letter “A” refers to genus Anopheles and the 2nd and 3rd letters are the first two letters of the species name. For example, the first clone of the Anopheles sinensis MJ1 is Asi_MJ1_Clone1. Full species names are shown in Table 1. Ae. aegypti MJ1 and An. sinensis MJ1 are highlighted in blue and red, respectively. Only clades with >0.70 credibility scores are shown as resolved clades. The thickness of the corresponding branches is proportional to the credibility score. Clades with the highest possible credibility value, 1.00, are indicated. Although the tree in this figure is unrooted, the position of midpoint root is indicated."
