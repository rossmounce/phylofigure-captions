"pone.0078473.g004.png","Phylogenetic relationships among Borrelia species using partial Intergenic spacer (IGS, 510 nucleotides) and partial FlaB gene (FLA, 269 nucleotides) concatenated sequences(PhyML 100 bootstraps, available at http://mobyle.pasteur.fr/cgi-bin/portal.py). The colored triangle estimated the Borrelia species diversity. We included in the B. merionesi clade (9 seq.) a Borrelia detected in a rodent captured in El Argoub (Morocco). The colored full circle correspond to the tick species determined by the 16S phylogenetic analysis of this study. The phylogram was constructed using a maximum-likelihood method from concatenated sequence data (220 sequences including GenBank reference sequences, 779 nucleotides). Bootstrap values >70 are shown (Scale bar, 0.01 substitutions per site). Seq. A.: B. crocidurae (GU350723 and NC017808), seq. B.: B. recurrentis (DQ000277 and DQ346814), seq. C.: B. duttonii (DQ000279 and DQ346833), seq. D.: B. merionesi (JX257047 and JX257050), seq. E.: B. hispanica (GU350718 and GU357614) and concatened sequences were used as references."
