Comparison of MLST and WGST analysis of VGIIa, VGIIb and VGIIc C. gattii isolates. Maximum parsimony phylogenetic analysis was performed in MEGA4 on MLST and WGST SNP data from VGIIa (panel A), VGIIb (panel B) and VGIIc (panel C) genomes. Scale bars indicate relative branch lengths for each analysis. The R265 whole genome sequence was used as the reference for SNP discovery (R265a-H-BC-02). VGIIa (panel A) analysis is shown both with and without R265, VGIIb and VGIIc shown only without R265. The numbers of SNPs included in each analysis is indicated. The consistency index value (CI) was calculated in MEGA4. Meaning of taxa nomenclature is described in legends for Figures 1 (MLST) and 2 (WGST). Trees shown are mid-point rooted, bootstrap values less than 50% are not shown."
