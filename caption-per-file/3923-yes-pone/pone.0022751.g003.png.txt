Phylogentic placement of German EHEC O104:H4 outbreak strain. Minimum-spanning tree based on allelic profiles of E. coli core genome genes (n = 1,144) portraying the phylogenetic relationship of the EHEC O104:H4 outbreak strain (LB226692), the historical EHEC 01-09591 (HUSEC041), additional E. coli strains representing the most common EHEC serotypes, intestinal and extraintestinal E. coli pathovars and commensals, from the NCBI RefSeq database. In addition, an in silico generated hypothetical O104:H4 progenitor is included. Each dot represents an allelic profile, the number on connecting lines represent the number of alleles that differ between two profiles. The different pathovars (EHEC, EAEC, ExPEC, EPEC, ETEC, commensals) are defined by colors and the EHEC serotypes are indicated."
