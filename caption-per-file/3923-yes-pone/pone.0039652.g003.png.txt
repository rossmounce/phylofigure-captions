"pone.0039652.g003.png","Predicted RNA secondary structure of HCV NS3 serine protease sequence.The RNA secondary structure of HCV-1b genome was predicted by the Mfold program. The viral genome sequence modelled, was an isolate phylogenetically classified as HCV 1b (accession number: AJ000009). A very stable stem-loop, including codons for amino acid positions 145 to 163 (corresponding at NS3 Protease coding region), was reported into box."
