"pone.0054701.g008.png","Effect of the Hxt on the transcription of other Fusarium oxysporum sugar transporter genes during consolidated bioprocessing (CBP) of wheat straw/bran.Wild type fungus 11C, Hxt-silenced mutant pSilent-1-Hxt-3 and overexpression mutant pBARGPE1-Hxt-6 were aerobically cultured on wheat straw/bran (10?1 ratio) and RT-PCR was conducted using RNA isolated from samples harvested 24 h post-inoculation. (A) Transcript accumulation in RNA extracts was quantified relative to that of the housekeeping gene ?-tubulin (FOXG_06228.2) by 2?-??Ct method, where ??Ct?=?(Ct, Target gene - Ct, ?-tubulin). Results are based on two experiments, each with three replicates per strain/mutant per medium. Bars indicate the SEM (LSD0.05?=?0.015) (B) A phylogenetic tree was constructed based on the protein sequence of 20 F. oxysporum strain 4287 sugar transporters. Protein sequences were aligned using European Bioinformatics Institutes?s ClustalW2 tool (www.ebi.ac.uk) [62] and a distance tree of 100 bootstrapped data sets was generated by using the Phylogeny.fr program and the neighbor-joining method [64]. Arrows indicated the three genes alluded to in part (A) above that were affected by Hxt expression."
