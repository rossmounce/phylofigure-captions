Bayesian phylogeny and timescale of primate evolution inferred from mitochondrial genomes.Nodes were supported by 100% Bayesian posterior probability (PP) and 100% approximate likelihood ratio statistic (aLRT). Exceptions are illustrated by the values of PP/aLRT on nodes. Bars indicate 95% credibility intervals. (*) Node not recovered in ML analysis."
