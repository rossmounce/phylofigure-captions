"pone.0069895.g001.png","Phylogenetic relationships of EV71 viruses isolated in this study and reference strains using VP1 sequences (A) and full genomes (B).Backgrounds of the EV71 viruses genotyped in this study and the reference viruses were provided in Table 1 and Table S1 [15], respectively. The prototype coxsackievirus A16 (CA16G10) was used as the outgroup virus. The phylogenetic tree was constructed using the neighbor-joining method. Bootstrap values (>70%) are shown as percentage derived from 1,000 sampling at the nodes of the tree. Scale bar denotes number of nucleotide substitutions per site along the branches. Red dot indicates the viruses isolated and sequenced in this study."
