Amino acid substitutions in the prairie vole lineage. The evolutionary relationship of the prairie vole to other rodents and rabbit is illustrated as a phylogenetic tree. Divergence times are represented by the branch lengths of the tree based on [39], [40]. The numbers above the terminal branch leading to the prairie vole represent the number of conservative/radical amino acid substitutions in the behaviorally-relevant proteins that were inferred by parsimony to have occurred in that lineage and unique to the prairie vole. MYA refers to millions of years ago."
