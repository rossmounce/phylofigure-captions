"pone.0056859.g001.png","A graphical representation of the operation of edge principal components analysis (edge PCA).The phylogenetic distribution of reads for a given sample determines its position in the principal components projection. For the first axis, reads that fall below edges with positive coefficients on that axis' tree (marked in orange on the tree) move the corresponding sample point to the right, while reads that land on edges with negative coefficients (marked in green on the tree) move the corresponding sample point to the left. The second axis is labeled with a subtree of the first tree (the position of which is marked with a star on the first principal component tree): reads below edges with positive coefficients move sample points up, while reads below edges with negative coefficients move sample points down. The principal components shown here are the actual principal components for the example shown in Figures 4, 5, and 6."
