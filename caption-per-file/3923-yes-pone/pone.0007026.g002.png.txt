Structural and phylogenic analysis of four zebrafish IGFs.(A) Sequence alignment of mature zebrafish (zf) IGF-1a, IGF-1b, IGF-2a, IGF-2b and mature human (h) IGF-1 and IGF-2. The B–C–A–D domains are labeled. Star indicates conserved cysteine. (B) Phylogenetic analysis of the vertebrate insulin/IGF family members. Amino acid sequences in the B and A domains were analyzed by the neighbor-joining method using the MEGA3 program [64]. Gaps were removed from the alignment. Bootstrap values derived from 1,000 runs are shown. Relaxins are used as an outgroup. Accession numbers for the sequences used are: human (IGF-1, NM_000618; IGF-2, NM_000612; insulin, NM_000207; relaxin, NM_080864), mouse (IGF-1, NM_010512; IGF-2, NM_010514, insulin 1, NM_008386; insulin 2, NM_008387; relaxin, NM_173184), Xenopus (IGF-1, M29857; IGF-2, BC070545), zebrafish (insulin a, NM_131056; insulin b, NM_001039064), common carp (IGF-1, EF536889; IGF-2, AF402958; insulin, X00989), trout (IGF-1, EF432852; IGF-2, EF432854; insulin, M21170), tilapia (IGF-1, AF033796; IGF-2, AF033801; IGF-3, EU272147; insulin, AF038123 ), shark (IGF-1, Z50081; IGF-2, Z50082), hagfish (IGF, M57735; insulin, V00649 ), sea lamprey (IGF, AB081462), Amphioxus insulin-like peptide mRNA (ILP, M55302). Sequence for Tetraodon, fugu and stickleback IGF-1, IGF2 and insulin were obtained by searching the Tetraodon genome (http://www.genoscope.cns.fr/externe/English/Projets/Projet_C/C.html), fugu genome (http://fugu.hgmp.mrc.ac.uk/), and stickleback genome (http://www.ensembl.org/Gasterosteus_aculeatus/). Sequence of sea lamprey insulin was obtained by searching sea lamprey genome (http://pre.ensembl.org/Petromyzon_marinus/). (C) Conserved synteny between human (Hs) and zebrafish (Zf) IGF loci. Vertical gray lines indicate a group of genes on the same chromosome, with order ignored to facilitate the comparison of orthologs and paralogs. Horizontal gray lines connect presumed orthologs within chromosome groups as well as paralogs between chromosome groups."
