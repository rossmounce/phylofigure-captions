"pone.0068681.g003.png","Phylogenetic analysis of Qb-SNAREs from Verticillium and other fungal species.The entire amino acid sequences of Qb-SNARE proteins of Verticillium and other fungi were aligned using Clustal X and the MP phylogenetic tree was constructed using PhyML package with kimura model under 100 replications of bootstrap analysis. Separate clades are indicated by vertical bars, branch times values were given and the orthologs in different filamentous fungi appeared to cluster together. Qb-type Sec20 of E. cuniculi was used as an outgroup."
