"pone.0020096.g004.png","SxtA4 phylogenetic tree and genomic copy number. a) Schematic representation of phylogenetic tree, drawn to scale (for full tree see Supporting Information S2). Maximum likelihood topology is shown. Numbers on nodes represent bootstrap values of maximum likelihood and Bayesian analyses, respectively. b) Genomic copy number of sxtA4 in A. catenella ACSH02 at three different time-points during the growth cycle."
