Phylogenetic analysis of Rhodobacteraceae recovered from Kaneohe Bay.Phylogenetic relationships between SSU rRNA gene clone sequences obtained from Station NB in Kaneohe Bay (prefixes NB031206 and NB062606) and representatives of the Family Rhodobacteraceae of the Alphaproteobacteria. The scale bar corresponds to 0.02 substitutions per nucleotide position. Open circles indicate nodes with bootstrap support between 50â€“80%, while closed circles indicate bootstrap support >80%, from 450 replicates. The bracket indicates the specific lineage primarily responsible for differences between storm and non-storm Rhodobacteraceae relative abundances. A variety of Gammaproteobacteria were used as outgroups (not shown). Accession numbers for sequences included in the phylogenetic tree but not listed in the figure include: Sulfitobacter - AJ550939, Y16425, AY180103, EF202614, AY180102, Y16427, DQ097527, DQ683726, Y17387, Y13155; Roseovarius - EU156066, AJ534215, AF098495, DQ120726, Y11551; Jannaschia - EF202612, AJ438157, DQ643999, AJ748747, AY906862; Loktanella - AY682198, AB246747, AJ582225, DQ344498, EF202613, AY682199, AJ440997, AJ582226."
