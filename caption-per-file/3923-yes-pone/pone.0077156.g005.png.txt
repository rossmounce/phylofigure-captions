"pone.0077156.g005.png","Molecular phylogenetic results modified from He et al.[8]. The topology of the Bayesian phylogenetic results obtained by combining ApoB (615 bp) and BRCA1 (792 bp) gene sequences modified from He et al. [8]. The distribution range for each species is based on the Red List of the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources, accessible online at (http://www.iucnredlist.org/). The dotted line divides groups A and B according to geographical regions."
