Maximum likelihood phylogenies of the fire ant OBPs (SiOBPs) and honey bee OBPs (AmOBPs). The phylogenies are based on the two best alignments (top: MUSCLE, bottom: PRANK). All trees are midpoint rooted in the absence of a suitable outgroup. Branch support is SH-like aLRT derived from PhyML analyses."
