"pone.0051023.g001.png","Phylogenetic analysis of AMA1 sequences.A. Phylogenetic tree of the AMA1 alleles expressed by 18 different isolates examined in this study in relation to 250 other AMA1 alleles obtained from the public database. Analysis was based on the ectodomain sequence. B. Phylogenetic tree of the AMA1 alleles expressed by the 18 different isolates used in this study, based on the AMA1 ectodomain sequence (amino acids 25–456). The AMA1 sequences of HCS-E5 and CSL-2 were found to be identical. C. Phylogenetic tree of the AMA1 alleles expressed by isolates used in this study, based on the C1-L sequence of AMA1 (amino acids 196–207). Translated ectodomain and C1-L protein sequences were aligned and phylogenetic trees constructed using ClustalW2."
