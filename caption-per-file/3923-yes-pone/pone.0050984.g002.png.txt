Real time expression analysis of the Arabidopsis ASK gene family. A; RNA from the indicated organs was isolated and used to assess ASK gene expression as described in the methods. Organs examined were 4–5-day-old seedlings, stage 5 leaves, green stem, green siliques, stage 9 flowers, and stage 15 flowers. Gene expression is depicted in MNE units ± SE after ACTIN2 normalization. Data are means of two independent biological repetitions ± SE. B; Cluster summary of the Pearson-based hierarchical clustering of ASK gene expression among select organs. The colors represent genes within the different phylogenetic clades as defined within Fig 1."
