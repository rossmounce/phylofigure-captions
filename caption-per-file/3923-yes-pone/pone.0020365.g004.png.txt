Genomic structure, palindrome prediction and phylogeny in human MAGE-A genomic region. (A) A diagonal line drawn from the upper left to the lower right indicates identity within the region. The region is divided into the three subregions, A, B, and C, which contain five, 10 and one MAGE-A genes, respectively. (B) The tree was constructed using the number of nucleotide differences (p-distances) among CDSs (1916 bp) of the 16 MAGE-A genes. The number at each node represents the bootstrap probability supporting that node. Bootstrap values greater than 50% are shown. Operational taxonomic units (OTU) in magenta, green and blue represent genes in subregions A, B and C, respectively. (C) Three predicted palindromes shown in subregions A, B and C. In subregion B, most of genes are located on putative palindrome arms."
