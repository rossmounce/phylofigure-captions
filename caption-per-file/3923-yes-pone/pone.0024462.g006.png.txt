Evolution of coexpression patterns in murine V2Rs. The neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree has been rooted with the family-C receptors. Branches corresponding to previously defined families have been collapsed and are shown as triangles. Bootstrap values >75% (over 1000 replicates) are shown at the corresponding nodes. The supposed origins and evolutionary shift of V2R coexpression patterns are indicated by gray arrows."
