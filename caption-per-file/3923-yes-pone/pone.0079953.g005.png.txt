Phylogenetic trees resulting from the analysis of the DNA sequences of (a) the HA gene and (b) 1Â kb from VACV-Cop F10L and VACV-Cop F12L each.The different CPXV clades cannot be resolved when using the sequence of the HA gene for phylogenetic analysis, as they all cluster together. In contrast, the concatenated sequences from F10L and F12L can be used to achieve a clear separation of all groups visible in Figure 3a. VARV, VACV, CMLV and ECTV represent collapsed clades containing data from all whole genome sequences available in GenBank. All displayed branches, unless otherwise indicated, have a Chi2-statistic value of at least 0.99."
