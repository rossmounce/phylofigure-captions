Phylogenetic relationships among adenovirus polymerase sequences inferred using the amino acid models implemented in MrBayes.The phylogenetic position of newly acquired sequences is indicated in grey. Node support values presented are posterior probabilities (PP): black circles PP>95, grey circles 95>PP>70, and white circles 70>PP>50. To simplify the graphical representation of this result, we pruned from the tree adenoviruses that were drawn from the same host and were strongly supported as monophyletic. When a sequence has been reported from two or more reptilian species, we indicate the infected species with a bracket."
