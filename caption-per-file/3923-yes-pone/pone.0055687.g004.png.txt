Pulsed Field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE) profile digested with XbaI.We performed PFGE analysis of 24 S. Newport strains (without two environmental farm isolates) isolated from diverse sources and geographic locations. PFGE profiles divided these strains into two major clusters with different groupings compared with the phylogenetic tree based on whole genome wide SNPs."
