"pone.0017025.g001.png","a–b. Determination of Guinea-Bissau-specific clusters in HIV-1 CRF02_AG and subsubtype A3 phylogenies. Maximum-likelihood trees were reconstructed based on the sequences from Guinea-Bissau together with reference sequences (A. CRF02_AG and B. subsubtype A3). The scale bar at the bottom of each tree represents 0.01 nucleotide substitutions per site. Asterisks along branches represent significant monophyletic clusters (**: Zero-branch-length test p-values 95% in corresponding Bayesian analysis. *: Zero-branch-length test p-values 90%). Statistically supported clusters are numbered according to appearance in tree and the corresponding tMRCA are marked with filled circles (red circles  =  Guinea-Bissau-specific tMRCAs, and black circles  =  the tMRCA of the CRF02_AG or subsubtype A3). The colours represent the country or geographic region representing the origin of each tip in the phylogeny."
