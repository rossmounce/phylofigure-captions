"pone.0015306.g003.png","Comparison of gene-based phylogeny, strain origins, and genome properties. The genome features (chromosome/plasmid content size, presence of genes of industrial importance) of the 36 L. lactis subsp. lactis strains are compared to MLST-based strain relatedness. From left-to-right: neighbor-joining tree of the 36 strains, strain name; strain origin (color code: green  =  plant, brown  =  animal skin, white  =  milk, red  =  starter strains, black  =  cheese, unmarked  =  uncertain origin); genetic groups determined from the NJ tree; clonal complexes determined by eBURST; ST numbering; presence of citP gene (red dot), lacE gene (blue diamond), and prtP gene (green triangle); chromosome (black rectangles) and plasmid content (white rectangles) sizes. Derivative strains are indicated by an asterisk. The two dashed red lines indicate mean chromosome and genome size, respectively."
