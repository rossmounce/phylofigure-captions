The historical distribution of Lagomorpha inferred from different algorithms: S-DIVA, Bayes-DIVA, Maximum parsimony.The phylogeny was based on the majority consensus trees derived from Bayesian inference analysis of three genes. Posterior probabilities are shown beside each node. Biogeographical regions used in the analysis including: Asia (A), Europe (B), North America (C), South America (D) and Africa (E). Out groups were excluded in the figures. Three methods identified Asia as the origin center of Lagomorpha (Node 1, S-DIVA 100%, Bayes-DIVA 79%, Maximum parsimony, 100%). Asia was also identified as the most probable ancestral region of leporids and ochotonids respectively (Node 2 and 3), while, Lepus firstly appeared in North America (Node 4)."
