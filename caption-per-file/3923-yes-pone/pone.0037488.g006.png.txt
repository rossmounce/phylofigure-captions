Phylogenetic tree of fungi and the presence of croziers and clamps.The tree is based on the latest phylogenetic data including those of James et al. [3]. In the Ascomycota, a smiling face indicates that croziers are present and a sad face indicates that they are absent. In the Basidiomycota, a smiling face indicates that clamps are present and a sad face indicates that they appear absent. No face is shown when we were not able to find data on the presence of croziers/clamps in the literature or that species from the group grow only as yeast."
