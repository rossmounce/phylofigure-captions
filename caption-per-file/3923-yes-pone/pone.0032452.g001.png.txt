Phylogenetic relatedness and evolutionary divergence times of species in the present sample.Chronogram based on phylogenetic analysis complemented with phylogenomic data of the species in the present sample (N = 67) (Tables S1, S2, S3; see also Materials and Methods). The branch points indicate when in phylogeny different species diverged from each other and a time scale in Ma (Million years ago) is shown at the bottom."
