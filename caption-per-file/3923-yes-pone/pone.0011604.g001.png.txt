Representative backbone tree topologies.Phylogenetic trees were constructed by using both orthologous proteins through phylogenomic approaches and 16S rRNA gene (For details on evolutionary models and phylogenetic methods, see Materials and Methods). T1 corresponds to the consensus of 1,197 NJ or ML trees and the supertree made with ML trees. T2 corresponds to the concatenated sequences tree built with ML and the supertree constructed with NJ trees. T3 corresponds to the concatenated sequences tree inferred with NJ. T4 corresponds to 16S rRNA tree inferred with Bayesian or ML. Trees derived from the phylogenomic analysis of the conserved 694 core genes show the same topology T1."
