Phylogenetic clustering of pygmy loris, human, mouse, canine, cow, and chicken gastrointestinal metagenomes.A double hierarchical dendrogram was established through weight-pair group clustering methods based on the non-scaling Manhattan distance. The dendrogram shows the phylogenetic distribution of the microorganisms among the ten metagenomes from the six different hosts, including pygmy loris (WFH), human (HSM and F1S), mouse (LMC and OMC), dog (K9C and K9BP), cow (CRP), and chicken (CCA and CCB). The linkages of the dendrogram do not show the phylogenetic relationship of the bacterial phylum and are based on the relative abundance of taxonomic profiles. The heat map depicts the relative percentage of each phylum of microorganism (variables clustering on the y axis) in each sample (x axis clustering). The heat map color represents the relative percentage of the microbial descriptions in each sample, with the legend indicated at the upper left corner. Branch length indicates the Manhattan distances of the samples along the x axis (scale at the upper right corner) and of the microbial phyla along the y axis (scale at the lower left corner)."
