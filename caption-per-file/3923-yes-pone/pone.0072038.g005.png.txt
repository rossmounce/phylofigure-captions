Molecular phylogenetic analysis.Amino acid sequences of the genes atp6, atp8, atp9, cob, cox1, and cox2 in Ganoderma lucidum and other 16 fungal species were used to construct this tree with the maximum likelihood method implemented in the software MEGA 5.05. The order, sub-kingdom, and kingdom corresponding to each species show their taxonomic classifications. Bootstrap supports were calculated from 1000 replicates."
