"pone.0077156.g004.png","Reconstruction of the ancestral distribution of Asiatic water shrews.Ancestral distribution range based on the Bayesian binary MCMC method. The distribution range is based on the majority tree annotated from Bayesian phylogenetic analysis (a). The classifications of the geographical regions of current samples are identified in different colors, with the letters beside the sample names indicating the following specimens: A) Chimarrogale himalayica leander from Taiwan; B) Chimarrogale platycephala from Japan; C) Chimarrogale himalayica leander from eastern China; D) Chimarrogale himalayicavarennei and Chimarrogale styani from southwestern China and Chimarrogale himalayicavarennei from northern Vietnam; E) Chimarrogale himalayica himalayica from Nepal; F) Chimarrogale phaeura from Borneo; and G) outgroups. The pies indicate the ancestral distribution based on the probabilities (%) at each node. Black stars show the combined probabilities of the reconstruction results <5%. The probabilities (%) of the reconstruction results of three major nodes are shown in (b). Vicariance and dispersal events are indicated at these nodes."
