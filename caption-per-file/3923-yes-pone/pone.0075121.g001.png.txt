Evolutionary relationships of Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains for mtDNA.The phylogenic tree was inferred by using the Maximum Likelihood method based on the Tamura-Nei model with bootstrapping (500 iterations). Branches corresponding to partitions reproduced in less than 80% bootstrap replicates are collapsed. The analysis involved 12 nucleotide sequences representing the concatenation of 4 mitochondrial loci (COX2, COX3, VAR1 and ATP6). All positions containing gaps and missing data were eliminated. There were a total of 2719 positions in the final dataset. Evolutionary analyses were conducted in MEGA5. Label describes the origin of the strains: natural isolates▪, distillery•, brewing□, wine▴."
