Phylogenetic tree of 16 complete mtDNA sequences from LHON patients.Rare LHON mutations are shown in bold. The position of rCRS [57] is indicated for reading off sequence motifs. Mutations are shown on the branches; they are transitions unless a base is explicitly indicated. The prefix @ designates reversions, while suffixes indicate: transversions (to A, G, C, or T), indels (+, d), gene locus (∼t, tRNA; ∼r, rRNA), synonymous or non-synonymous changes (s or ns) and heteroplasmies (h). Recurrent mutations are underlined. One mtDNA sequence (I; black circle) from a control subject (GenBank accession number FJ190383) was also included to illustrate that sequences 11 and 12 acquired independently the LHON mutation m.14568C>T. The haplogroup affiliation of each haplotype is based on mutational motifs and follows the most updated human phylogeny [35]."
