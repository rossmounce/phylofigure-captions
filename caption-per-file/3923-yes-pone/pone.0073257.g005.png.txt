Eukaryotic diversity in intertidal sediment.18S rDNA-based phylogenetic reconstruction of eukaryotic diversity (here: Protista and Fungi) in intertidal sediment sampled in A) December 2011 and B) June 2011, and C) in an intertidal diatom mat sampled in April 2012. Phyla with more than three OTUs are shown as colored leaves, phyla with 1-3 OTUs as grey leaves, and unrepresented phyla as white leaves. The size of the colored leaves is proportional to the number of OTUs in each phylum which is given in parentheses. The scale bar represents the number of substitutions for a unit branch length."
