"pone.0062566.g002.png","Phylogenetic relationships within Clermontia (32 populations spanning all 21 extant species, with two outgroup Cyanea species) based on 58 ISSR characters.Numbers above branches indicate bootstrap support levels â‰¥ 20%. (A) MP phylogeny based on unweighted characters. The tree shown is the strict consensus of 2296 shortest trees; (B) MP phylogeny based on sequential reweighting of ISSR characters; tree is strict consensus of six shortest trees. Colored band shows island distribution of populations (see key) and presence (+) vs. absence of petaloid sepals."
