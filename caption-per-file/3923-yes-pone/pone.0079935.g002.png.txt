Topology comparisons between our Phylobayes results and past studies.The phylogeny obtained from phylobayes was compared to past hypotheses that were well-resolved regarding our included taxa. Three topologies met our criteria of taxon inclusion and resolution: Verhoeff [54], Enghoff [10,55], and Sierwald and Bond [2]. The full trees from each study are shown, the data source used to build the tree is indicated, and branches leading to taxa included in our analysis are shown in red. P-values obtained from each test are provided. Significant results (p < 0.05) are bolded and indicate the likelihood value of our Phylobayes results were significantly better than the alternative. Our RAxML results were also compared to the Phylobayes tree."
