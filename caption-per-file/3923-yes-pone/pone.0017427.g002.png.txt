"pone.0017427.g002.png","Phylogenetic analysis of 58 HRSV sequences in the F and G genes. Phylogenetic reconstruction was by neighbour joining of MCL-corrected pair-wise distances. F gene sequences rooted with bovine RSV; G gene sequences unrooted. Sequence symbols are colour coded by geography to emphasize the congruence between the phylogenies of the two genome regions. Monophyletic groupings which contain sequences from the 07/08 respiratory season for which sequence data was available from all four referral centres are indicated in shaded boxes. Bootstrap values >70% are indicated."
