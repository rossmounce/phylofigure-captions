"pone.0043554.g001.png","Bdelloid phylogenies.Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian phylogenies reconstructed with concatenated mitochondrial proteins and rooted with Monogononta and Acanthocephala. Left and right trees represent two predominant topologies, where the root lies between Macrotrachela and the rest of the bdelloids (left) or Philodina and the rest of the bdelloids (right). The left tree represents the topology recovered from three analyses: 1) ML JTT, 2) MrBayes MtRev, and 3) Phylobayes with CAT Poisson model. Bootstrap support values and posterior probabilities for the position of the root are listed in the order given above for each analysis. The right tree represents the topology recovered from six analyses: 1) ML MtRev, 2) ML Partitioned data (models were assigned to each partition and partitions were generated by grouping together genes that shared the same model) 3) ML JTT on Dayhoff-recoded data, 4) Maximum Parsimony, 5) MrBayes WAG, and 6) Phylobayes with CAT GTR model. Bootstrap support values and posterior probabilities for the position of the root and the RHM clade (Rotaria, Habrotrocha, and Macrotrachela) are listed in the order given above for each analysis. Thicker branches indicate clades strongly supported by most analyses (bootstrap support or posterior probability >90). Red taxon labels indicate members of the family Philodinidae, green taxon labels indicate the family Habrotrochidae, and black indicates the family Adinetidae. Neither Philodinidae nor the order Philodinida is monophyletic. Line represents 0.25 amino acid substitutions per site. Summaries of strategies and support value provided in Table 2."
