SoxB1/B2 evolution mapped onto the metazoan timetree. The genes of Sox subgroups B1 and B2 are represented by blue and red rectangles, respectively. Numbers on the right side of the tree indicate the estimated inventory of the Sox subgroups B2 and B1 respectively in the taxon. The numbers in black indicate that the inventory estimate for the taxon is based on the comprehensive survey in whole genome sequences; the numbers in blue indicate that the inventory estimate for that taxon is based on heuristic survey; the numerals in parentheses indicate the numbers of genes having ambiguous identities because only incomplete HMG box sequences are available for these genes. The known conserved gene neighborhood (CGN) of the group B Sox genes in species belonging to that taxon are indicated on the right of the taxon name. The line breaks in Drosophila and Apis indicate linkage breaks. The question mark in Daphnia indicates that the linkage between the SoxB2 genes and SoxB1 is not yet determined. The names of phylogenetic groups are indicated beside the nodes or along the terminal branches. The ancestral genomic states of SoxB1/B2 at the major nodes of the metazoan phylogeny are reconstructed on the principle of parsimony and shown beside the nodes. The two yellow blocks over phylogenetic nodes indicate the range of the phylogenetic timing of the duplication events. The asterisks beside phylogenetic nodes indicate that the timing of the nodes is arbitrary due to lack of information. Abbreviations in rectangles: D, duplication; FSGD, fish-specific genome duplication; GD, genome duplication; SD, segmental duplication; TD, tandem gene duplication."
