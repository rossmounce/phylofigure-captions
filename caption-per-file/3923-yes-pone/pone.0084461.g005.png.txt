The phylogenetic tree of the nine sequences derived from P. cochleariae belonging to the purple branch (see Figure 3 and 4, Figure S4) and homologous sequences derived from the whole tree of life, especially from Dendroctonus ponderosae (Dc) as well as from Tribolium castaneum (Tc), was calculated using RaxML.Indicated in purple, it can be seen that the beetles? sequences build up a separate branch."
