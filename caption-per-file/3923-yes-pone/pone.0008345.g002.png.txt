"pone.0008345.g002.png","The array of CPR cuticular protein genes located approximately at band 44C of D. melanogaster chromosome 2R and the orthologous regions in six other Drosophila species.A. Schematic of the organization of genes in the array, with colored boxes matching colored symbols in the phylogeny according to the legend at left. Names at top are of D. melanogaster genes; plus and minus symbols indicate relative orientation. Genes with dark outlines are predicted to be intronless. B. Neighbor-joining phylogeny (see Methods) of predicted amino acid sequence with bootstrap support indicated."
