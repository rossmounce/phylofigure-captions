"pone.0025586.g001.png","Identification of MYT1 and its distribution in fungi. (A) Mycelial growth and perithecium formation of the Z39P105 mutant on potato dextrose agar (PDA) and carrot agar, respectively. Pictures were taken 3 d after inoculation and 7 d after sexual induction from PDA and carrot agar. Arrows indicate protoperithecia. (B) Molecular characterization of the vector insertion event in the Z39P105 genome. (C) Distribution of MYT1 in representative fungal species. The distribution image was constructed by using the BLASTMatrix tool that is available on the Comparative Fungal Genomics Platform (http://cfgp.riceblast.snu.ac.kr/) [62]. (D) Phylogenetic tree of MYT1 homologs in several fungal species. The alignment was performed with ClustalW, and the MEGA program Version 4.0 was used to perform a 1,000 bootstrap phylogenetic analysis using the neighbor joining method. amp, ampicillin resistance gene; hph, hygromycin B resistance gene. Pi, Phytophthora infestans; Pr, P. ramorum; Ps, P. sojae; Af, Aspergillus fumigatus; An, A. nidulans; Ao, A. oryzae; Bc, Botrytis cinerea; Fo, Fusarium oxysporum; Fv, F. verticillioides; Hc, Histoplasma capsulatum; Mo, Magnaporthe oryzae; Nc, Neurospora crassa; Pa, Podospora anserine; Ca, Candida albicans; Kl, Kluyveromyces lactis; Sc, Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Cc, Coprinus cinereus; Cn, Cryptococcus neoformans; Pc, Phanerochaete chrysosporium; nd, not detected."
