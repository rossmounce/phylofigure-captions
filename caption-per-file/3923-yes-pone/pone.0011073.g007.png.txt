A phylogenetic perspective of Malagasy primate niche space as defined by temperature variables (principal component 2).There is no significant phylogenetic signal in this niche axis for all species comparisons (p = 0.568),or within families (Lepilemuridae (p = 0.415), Cheirogaleidae (p = 0.327), Indriidae (p = 0.304), Lemuridae (p = 0.431). Also note that several distantly related species converge on a similar niche space."
