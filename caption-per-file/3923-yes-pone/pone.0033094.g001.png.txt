Nemitin domain architecture and phylogenetic distribution.(A) Domain diagram of nemitin showing the N-terminal LisH and CTLH domains and the C-terminal WD40 repeat domain. Amino acid numbers shown indicate the locations of predicted features based on mouse nemitin (NP_852065.2). Also shown are schematic representations of the antigen used for antibody production (His-nemitin-N2, indicated by a star), as well as FLAG-tagged and GFP-tagged truncation variants used for interaction studies. (B) Phylogenetic tree showing representative species that possess nemitin orthologs as defined by OrthoMCL DB (http://www.orthomcl.org). Common names shown for simplicity, zebrafish = Danio rerio, nematode = Ceanorhabditis elegans, fruitfly = Drosophila melanogaster, sea anemone = Nematostella vectensis, ciliated protozoan = Tetrahymena thermophila. (C) Multiple sequence alignment of the N-terminal domain of nemitin from select sequences. Note that some nemitin sequences without well-conserved LisH/CTLH domains are not included in the alignment. (D) Multiple sequence alignment of the WD40 domain of nemitin from select sequences. Note that some species were omitted to prevent ambiguity in the alignment."
