"pone.0008360.g003.png","Schematic SNP and INDEL phylogeny, indicating genetic markers and Francisella subclades.Markers presented in this study are indicated in black and, for comparison, SNP markers developed in a recent study by Vogler et al 2009 [1] are indicated in gray. The branch names of Vogler et al. have been abbreviated to simplify the nomenclature. Stars indicate terminal subclades defined by Francisella genomes and circles represent collapsed branch points along the genetic lineages that contain isolates of a particular genotype (a subclade). The subclades are named for the flanking SNPs and INDELs. The branch lengths do not represent true phylogenetic distances. The position of B.15/Ftind47 (marked by the asterisk in the figure) could not be definitively determined; it could be either where shown, or be descendant from B.1/2."
