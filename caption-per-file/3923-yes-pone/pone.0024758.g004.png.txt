Phylogenetic analysis of the isolated densovirus. The phylogenetic tree was generated using Mega 4.0 with maximum parsimony and bootstrap 500. Reference densovirus strains were selected after blasting the NCBI NT database with a 398 bp fragment assembled with the small RNAs. Numbers in parentheses indicates the reference number of the particular virus stain [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22]. The virus strain identified in this work has been assigned the name Culex tritaeniorhynchus densovirus YN2009 (indicated by a solid arrow). Scale bar represents the number of nucleotide substitutions."
