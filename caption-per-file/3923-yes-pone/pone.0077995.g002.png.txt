"pone.0077995.g002.png","Phylogenetic analysis of OPHC2 enzymes.A. Simplified phylogenetic tree of several OPHs (OPHC2s and MPHs) and lactonases (AiiAs and AiiBs) exhibiting a αβ/βα topology. Sequences were selected from NCBI blast (sequence identity>40%) using input query of OPHC2 from P. pseudoalcaligenes, MPH from Stenotrophomonas sp. Dsp-4, AiiA from B. thuringiensis and AiiB from A. fabrum str. C58. Alignment was performed using the T-coffee server and the tree was built using PhyML. The tree has been arbitrarily rooted for clarity. Bootstraps values are indicated. B. Sequence alignment of OPHC2 from P. pseudoalcaligenes (OPHC2-1) and Stenotrophomonas sp. SMSP-1 (OPHC2-2), MPH from Stenotrophomonas sp. Dsp-4, AiiA from B. thuringiensis and AiiB from A. fabrum str. C58. Conserved residues are represented with black font while similar residues are represented with grey font. Secondary structures are annotated according to OPHC2 structure (Fig. 3C & S4) (β-sheets are represented by orange arrows and α-helices are represented by light blue tubes). Conserved residues involved in the divalent cations coordination are indicated by red stars. Modeled parts of OPHC2 are represented in green (see also Fig. S4). This lacking part is also highlighted by a green font."
