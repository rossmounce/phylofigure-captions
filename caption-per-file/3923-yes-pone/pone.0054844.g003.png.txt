Inferred phylogeny of eight completed bacterial genomes.Panel A: Inferred phylogeny of eight completed bacterial genomes using their 16S rRNA sequences. Data was analyzed using the Maximum Likelihood method based on the JTT matrix-based model conducted in MEGA5. There were a total of 1,515 positions in the final dataset and 100 bootstrap replicates were included. Panel B: Inferred phylogeny of eight completed bacterial genomes using whole genome alignment. Alignments were conducted in MAUVE [21] and SNPs within conserved regions were extracted. Data was analyzed using the Maximum Likelihood method based on the JTT matrix-based model conducted in MEGA5. There were a total of 98,659 positions in the final dataset and 100 bootstrap replicates were included."
