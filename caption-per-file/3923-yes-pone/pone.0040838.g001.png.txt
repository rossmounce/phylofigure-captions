Phylogenetic reconstruction of corbiculate bees based on Long Wavelength Rhodopsin and Arginine Kinase.The tree was obtained by means of a phylogenetic mixture model based on Bayesian approach. The numbers next to nodes indicate the posterior probability of occurrence of the clade. The letters above the nodes correspond to the hypothetical ancestors, whose most probable character state is shown in Figures 2 and 3."
