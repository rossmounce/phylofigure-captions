"pone.0089876.g002.png","Phylogenetic relationships in the genus Nostoc, based on the best ML tree of the analysis on the 16S dataset.Values above branches represent ML bootstrap and Bayesian PP values, respectively. Names in bold are those for which DNA sequences were produced for this study. Color boxes represent phylotypes containing our sequences and defined by well-supported monophyletic groups. Colors in the taxa names represent the type of the thallus containing the Nostoc: in green tripartite thalli, in red pannarioid thalli and in blue collematoid thalli. Taxa names refer to the host of the Nostoc symbionts, when available. Thick black branches have MLBS >70 and Bayesian pp>0.95, dark grey branches have MLBS >70 but pp0.95 but MLBS<70."
