"pone.0034581.g004.png","Phylogenetic analysis of the hemagglutinin (HA) gene of influenza pH1N1 isolates.The phylogenetic tree was constructed using the neighbor-joining method (CLUSTAL W method) of the MegAlign program (Lasergene software suite, DNASTAR Inc., Madison, WI). The tree represents amino acids 111 through 360 of the mature HA protein. Reference strains for the six circulating subclades (2–7) are shown in bold text, with their defining mutations shown to the right. The vaccine strain, A/CA/7/2009, is shown in bold and italicized. Isolates collected by NHRC from recruits who had been vaccinated greater than 14 days are italicized. Strains from the same geographical location and time of collection from the GISAID database are included in the tree as well as two samples collected from the same recruit training sites in 2009. The scale indicates the distance created by a one amino-acid difference between sequences. The number of amino acid changes between subclades is denoted by a delta symbol (Δ)."
