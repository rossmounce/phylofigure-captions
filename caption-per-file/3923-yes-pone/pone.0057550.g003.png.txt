"pone.0057550.g003.png","Comparison of phylogenies obtained for the 16 Bodega Bay species.A) mitochondrial gene tree (COI and 16S), B) nuclear gene tree (18S), C) topology for Bodega Bay species extracted from the 88 species 18S tree shown in Figure 2. All trees are 50% majority rule consensus trees from MrBayes analyses, with the node labels giving posterior probabilities. For full species names see Figure 1 (note that multiple genera with the same initial letter are abbreviated here). The only conflict between these topologies is within the Talitroidea (Protohyale frequens, Parallorchestes cowani, and Allorchestes angusta). However, the alternate topology obtained in the 88 species analysis is not well supported; the posterior probability = 0.89, where strong support is typically >95% for posterior probabilities (rather than >70% for bootstrap probabilities [89], [90])."
