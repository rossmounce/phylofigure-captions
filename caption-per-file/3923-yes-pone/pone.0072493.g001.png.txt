Summary of the major clades of Rutaceae, based on published molecular phylogenies[16], [19].Shown for comparison are the subfamilial classifications of Engler [3], [4], Thorne [20] and Kubitzki et al.[2]. The number of Australasian genera in each group is indicated (values in brackets represent the total number of those genera included in family-wide molecular phylogenies [16], [19]). Subfamily Rutoideae, as currently defined, is paraphyletic; its type genus, Ruta, occurs in clade R1. If clade R2 was considered worthy of recognition as a separate subfamily it would need a different name: the oldest of the names available, each with equal priority under the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature [65], are Zanthoxyloideae, Amyridoideae and Diosmoideae."
