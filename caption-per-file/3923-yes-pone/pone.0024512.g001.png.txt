"pone.0024512.g001.png","Phylogenetic relationships of the representative sequences from each OTU and the representative sequences from GenBank. The DNA fragment of AMF (partial SSU, ITS region and partial LSU rDNA sequences of approx. 1.5 kb, amplified by primers SSUmCf - LSUmBr) were obtained from roots sampled from three mangrove species in three intertidal zones, in bold. Sequences with the same alpha code (A-AK) are from the same OTUs. The asterisks are used to indicate the ‘novel’ phylotypes; the values above the branches are Bayesian posterior probabilities (bold) followed by bootstrap values (1000 replicates); only support greater than 70% is shown."
