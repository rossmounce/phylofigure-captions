"pone.0029027.g001.png","Mirror trees of the evolutionary history reconstructions of embryonic heart rates (beats per minute; left side) and adult body mass (grams; right), according to four different phylogenetic hypotheses (Aâ€“D). Some major clades are identified in A (equal positioning in B) and C (equal positioning in D). The three-letter codes after the scientific name of each species indicate the country where heart rate was measured: AUS-Australia, CHI-China, USA-The United States of America."
