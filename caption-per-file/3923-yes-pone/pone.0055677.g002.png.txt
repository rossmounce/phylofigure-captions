Time-calibrated phylogeny of Acanthaceae showing contemporaneous evolution of Acantheae (95% CI?=?54?24 mya) and Ruellieae (95% CI?=?55?31 mya).Stars indicate two internal fossil calibrations. All branches except placement of the Neuracanthus lineage are strongly supported. Photographs (by Martin Cheek) of living Physacanthus batanganus showing variegated leaves and unique morphology (see text)."
