"pone.0047392.g002.png","Maximum likelihood phylogeny of STR3 orthologs.The maximum likelihood phylogeny was reconstructed with RAxML, as described in Materials and Methods. Nodes with black circles indicate that these clusters are well supported (?70% bootstrap support). Purple branches and species names indicate sequences with a fused C-terminal mevalonate kinase domain. Species that have known STR3 orthologs prior to this study are shown in green. Protein sequences were obtained from the Fungal Genome Collection (FGC). For those species not present within FGC, sequences were obtained from the NCBI database and their accession numbers are given in parentheses. Asterisks indicate sequences retrieved from the Saccharomyces Genome Database (SGD)."
