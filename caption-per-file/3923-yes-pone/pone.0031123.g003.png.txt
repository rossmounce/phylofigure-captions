"pone.0031123.g003.png","RAxML tree depicting the relationships of Malpaisomys within Muridae based on the analysis of the combined cytb and IRBP genes. ML and BI analyses of the dataset gave a similar topology. Numbers above the branches reflect support obtained from the analysis of the dataset following the two different reconstructions (BP RAxML/PP MrBayes. The symbol “–” indicates that phylogenetic relationships are not supported by one of the two analyses. Tribal arrangement following [10] is indicated on the right of the tree."
