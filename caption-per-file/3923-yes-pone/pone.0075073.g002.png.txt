"pone.0075073.g002.png","Genome-based phylogenetic analysis of the L. casei group.(A) Phylogenetic relationships between the genomes of sequenced lactobacilli inferred from 34 concatenated ribosomal protein amino acid sequences. The scale bar represents an evolutionary distance. Sequences were aligned with ClustalW with a bootstrap trial of 1,000 and bootstrap values (%) are indicated at the nodes. An unrooted tree was generated using NJplot. The chromosome size is shown in parentheses. (B) Three-way comparisons between L. casei ATCC 393 with L. rhamnosus ATCC 53103 and L. paracasei ATCC 334. The 2,191 genes shared by the three strains were classified into three categories on the basis of the BLAST score ratio analysis [23]. (C) Venn diagram comparing the gene inventories of four strains of the L. casei group. Data resulted from reciprocal BLASTP analysis. The numbers of shared and unique genes are shown."
