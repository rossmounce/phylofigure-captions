The begomovirus affecting cotton in Sindh likely originates from Egypt. Neigbour-joining phylogenetic dendrogram based upon an alignment of all complete genome nucleotide sequences of Cotton leaf curl Gezira virus (CLCuGV) available in the databases and the two available sequences of Hollyhock leaf crumple virus (the virus species most closely related to CLCuGV) with the sequences isolated from Pakistan. In each case the database accession number is given. The numbers at nodes represent percentage bootstrap confidence scores (1000 replicates). The alignment was arbitrarily rooted on outgroup, the sequence of Tomato pseudo curly top virus (TPCTV), a distantly related geminivirus. The plant species from which viruses were isolated and their geographical origins are indicated; Burkina Faso (BFA). Additionally, the viruses originating from north Africa (N) and from Africa south of the Sahara (S) are indicated."
