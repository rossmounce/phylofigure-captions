Taxonomic and phylogenetic position of species with and without a Pcl K intron.In Figure 4A and 4B, the species harboring a Pcl K orthologous intron with an intact or an eroded heg are in orange and green, respectively. The species lacking an orthologous intron are in black. The phylogenetic position of each fungal species was established according to the phylogenetic tree reported by James et al. [29] for the fungal kingdom using a six-gene phylogeny. When not present in the tree, species were located according to the nearest taxon (same genus or order) found in the tree."
