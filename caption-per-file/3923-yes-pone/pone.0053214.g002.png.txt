"pone.0053214.g002.png","The phylogenetic relationships of the MCM7 and antifungal protein coding sequences.A. Rooted 50% majority rule maximum parsimony phylogenetic tree of the MCM7 coding sequences. The Tu. melanosporum sequence was designated as the outgroup for rooting the tree. The numbers at the nodes are the bootstrap percentages based on 1,000 replications. The presence (+) or absence (?) of an antifungal protein gene is indicated for each species in the tree. B. The single most parsimonious phylogenetic tree recovered from an exhaustive search of the antifungal protein coding sequences. The tree is midpoint rooted. Accession numbers of the sequences used for both trees are given in Table 5."
