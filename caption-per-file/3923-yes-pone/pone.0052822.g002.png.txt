Mitochondrial phylogeny of scorpions in the Vaejovis vorhiesi group.Phylogeny inferred from Bayesian analyses of 1258 bp of concatenated COI and 16S mitochondrial sequence data. Posterior probability support values for nodes are indicated by coded dots explained in the figure legend. Inferred lineages are indicated by black bars. Samples used in species tree reconstruction are indicated in bold font. Localities of haplotypes are listed in Table 1. Inset depicts the geographical localities of putative sister species of montane Vaejovis isolated on opposite sides of the Sea of Cortez. The divergence of these two species caused by the split of the Cape region of Baja California from mainland Mexico was used to calibrate the molecular clock."
