Phylogenetic relationships of Wallabia and the three Macropus subgenera, M. (Macropus), M. (Osphranter) and M. (Notamacropus).(A) The supertree of Cardillo et al. [6] summarizing previous molecular and morphological phylogenies and (B) Meredith et al.'s [7] evolutionary timescale (ave. of four BEAST analyses), showing the 2?2.4 Ma duration divergence cluster. Both trees are modified to include only the taxa sampled in the present study. Dendrolagini was not recovered by Cardillo et al. [6], however its inclusion in the summary tree is warranted on subsequent strong evidence from morphology [2] and all recent molecular analyses. Photos include (from the top) W. bicolor, M. rufogriseus (left), M. irma (right), M. rufus and M. giganteus. Photo credits ? Matt Phillips, except M. irma (Ric Dawson) and M. rufus (Daniel Hoops)."
