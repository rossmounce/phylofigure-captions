Comparison of the gene order structures of the VT2 phages.Genes located inside the prophage are shown as blue arrows. A transposase in O157:H7 Sakai is indicated in green. Two sub-regions have been defined and are shown in green and orange. The gene into which the insertion site is located, wrbA, is indicated in red. The location of the integrase (int), exonuclease (exo) and the Shiga toxin genes (stx2A, stx2B) are shown. For 01-09591, a contig containing wrbA is shown next to the contigs containing the prophage. Comparisons are shown as in Figure 3. The maximum-likelihood phylogeny of two sub-regions is shown below the map. Colors represent different subsets of strains, as in Figure 1."
