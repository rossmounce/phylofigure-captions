Relationship between phylogeny and A) feeding rates, B) stable isotope signatures.In A) circle size indicates feeding rates (species with non-significant feeding rates on a particular food [compared to controls] have that rate set to 0; this is indicated by a+sign). Feeding rates for eelgrass, detritus, and macroalgae (Ulva spp.) were measured in mg wet weight consumed per individual per day, so circle size is comparable between those foods. Feeding rates on epiphytes were measured in µg chla per individual per day, and so are not on the same scale as the other 3 foods. In B), larger circles indicate higher δ13C or δ15N. The scale is comparable across seasons within a single isotope only (i.e., N or C). Note that the 3 species found on the outer coast have been trimmed from the phylogeny and excluded from the analysis of phylogenetic signal. The species with missing winter values is present only in the summer. Additional figures with both means and standard errors for each trait are available as supplementary material (Figure S1)."
