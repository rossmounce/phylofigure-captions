"pone.0078860.g008.png","Phylogenetic tree of ABCG (PDR) protein sequences from Arabidopsis and Vitis vinifera.The amino acid sequences of all Arabidopsis ABCG (PDR) proteins and those of Vitis vinifera were aligned using the MUSCLE program and subjected to phylogenetic analysis by the distance with neighborjoining method using MEGA5 programme. Accession numbers for Arabidopsis sequences are AtABCG29 (NP_190919.1), AtABCG30 (NP_566543.1), AtABCG31 (NP_193258.2), AtABCG32 (NP_180555.2), AtABCG33 (NP_180259.1), AtABCG34 (NP_181265.1), AtABCG35 (NP_181179.2), AtABCG36 (NP_172973.1), AtABCG37 (NP_176196.1), AtABCG38 (NP_190916.1), AtABCG39 (NP_683617.1), AtABCG40 (NP_176867.2), AtABCG41 (NP_173005.1), AtABCG42 (NP_680692.1), AtABCG43 (NP_680693.5) and AtABCG44 (NP_680694.2). AtSKD1 (AEC08019.1) and VvSKD1 (XP_002266534.1) were used as outgroups."
