The one-of-each family of ticks. (A) Alignment indicating conserved cysteines in black background, conserved residues in blue background. Sequences starting with Am are from A. maculatum and are recognized by a red circle, those starting with IXOSCA are from Ixodes scapularis retrieved from GenBank and are recognized by a blue triangle, those from Rhipicephalus were assembled from DBEST ESTs as described before and are recognized by a green square [1]. The symbols at the bottom indicate (*) identity of residues, (:) conserved and (.) less conserved residues. (B) Bootstrapped phylogram of the alignment in (A). The numbers at the nodes indicate the bootstrap support and the bar at the bottom indicates 20% amino acid divergence."
