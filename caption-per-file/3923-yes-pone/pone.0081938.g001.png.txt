"pone.0081938.g001.png","Phylogenetic tree and schematic representation of select CYP sequences.(A) Genomic DNA sequences were aligned using ClustalW, and the phylogenetic tree was generated using the Neighbor-joining method. The unit bar represents relative evolutionary distance. The Arabidopsis CYP51 sequence was used as an outgroup. (B) Schematic illustration of CYP genes. Filled boxes represent exons, and thinner boxes at the 5? of 3? ends indicate untranslated sequences. The base ?A? at the translation start codon was set to 1. All of the compared CYPs, except AtCYP51, consist of 7?10 exons, characterizing BR biosynthetic genes belonging to the CYP85 clan."
