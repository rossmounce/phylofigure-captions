Ancestral networks that were reconstructed for the S. cerevisiae PPI network.Following the phylogenetic tree, PPI networks on different evolutionary levels were (re-)constructed: the present-day yeast (present-day protein), the ancestral fungi (fuNOG, last common ancestor of fungi), the ancestral eukaryote (KOG/euNOG, last common ancestor of animals, plants and fungi), and the Last Universal Common Ancestor (COG/NOG, last common ancestor of archaea, bacteria, and eukaryotes). The colors of nodes represent the different functional categories extracted from the eggNOG database [59]."
