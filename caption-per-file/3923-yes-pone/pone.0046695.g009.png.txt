Rooted neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree of Deltaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria, Verrucomicrobia, Actinobacteria, and Planctomycetes involved in DIC assimilation obtained from 16S rRNA gene clone libraries of 13C fractions from SIP experiments conducted at NH-10 in September 2008, March 2009 and May 2010.High similar OTUs were collapsed for clarity. Shaded clades represent those identified by Swan et al., 2012 to possibly participate in C-1 metabolism or dark carbon fixation."
