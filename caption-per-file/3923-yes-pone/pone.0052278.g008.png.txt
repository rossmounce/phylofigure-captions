Evolutionary analysis of Hydra PPOD reveals a link to bacterial carbohydrate-binding proteins.A bayesian inference phylogenetic tree was generated for the Hydra PPOD family and the top-scoring related sequences retrieved by BLAST. The Hydra PPOD family forms a single clade restricted to Hydra and has expanded by tandem duplication of a single ?-trefoil domain, followed by whole-gene duplications. The closest ancestral sequences are of bacterial origin. The most related sequences include additional domains such as glycosyl hydrolase domains and sugar-binding domains (e.g., ricin). Unlike most of the detected bacterial homologs, the closest outgroup of the Hydra PPOD clade (a sequence from Marinomonas) has a single ?-trefoil domain, supporting its close relationship to the inferred ancstral PPOD domain. Posterior probabilities are indicated above the major clades. See Fig. S4 for an expanded version of this tree."
