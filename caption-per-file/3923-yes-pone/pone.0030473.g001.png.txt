"pone.0030473.g001.png","Bayesian phylogenetic analysis of 16 Didemnum vexillum cytochrome oxidase I (COI) haplotypes. Numbers on nodes denote posterior probability values. GenBank accession numbers of the COI haplotypes are shown. Asterisks indicate seven COI haplotypes (H11â€“H17) not previously reported by Stefaniak et al. (2009) [52]. COI sequences from Didemnum psammatode (EU742661, JN624758), D. albidum (EU419432, EU419456) and Didemnum sp. B (EU419407, EU419408) were used as outgroups."
