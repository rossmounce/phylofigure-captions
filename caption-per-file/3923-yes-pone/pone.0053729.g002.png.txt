"pone.0053729.g002.png","Comparative phylogenies of the conserved elongation factor EF1 ? and the BIK1.Maximum likelihood phylogenies from alignments of the protein sequences were estimated using the PhyML program with the substitution model WAG and a number of bootstraps of 100 [52] (http://www.phylogeny.fr). A. Phylogeny of EF1? represents the evolution of fungal species. Selected proteins are from Botrytis cinerea (BROAD: BC1G_09492.1), Sclerotinia sclerotiorum (GenBank: EDO03042.1), Fusarium verticillioides (BROAD: FVEG_02381.3), Fusarium oxysporum (GenBank: EGU83230.1), Fusarium fujikuroi (B. Tudzynski, unpublished data), Fusarium graminearum (BROAD: FGSG_08811.3), Podospora anserina (NCBI: XP_001907437.1), Aspergillus oryzae (GenBank: BAA76296.1), Aspergillus niger (NCBI: XP_001398942.1), Ajellomyces capsulatus (GenBank: AAB17119.1), Coccidioides immitis (GenBank: AAK54650.1), Schizosaccharomyces pombe (NCBI: NP_594440.1), Saccharomyces cerevisiae (GenBank: AAA34585.1). B. Phylogeny of BIK1 indicates a non-vertical inheritance. Selected proteins are from the pink B. cinerea strain 1750 (EMBL: HE802550), F. fujikuroi (GenBank: CAB92399.1), F. oxysporum (BROAD: FOXG_04757), and F. verticillioides (BROAD: FVEG_03379). The PKS sequence from A. niger (JGI: ANG51499) was used to root the tree."
