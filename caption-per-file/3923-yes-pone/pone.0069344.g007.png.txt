Schematic representation of controversial relationships in high-level phylogenetics of Hymenoptera.Numbers next to nodes and superscripts in the text indicate nodes for which the consensus trees obtained in specific analyses are in conflict with the diagram (see these for details). Numbers next to taxon names stand for non-monophyly of the group. Besides hypotheses derived from our data, we also show selected results from the literature. If a dataset or publication does not appear in one of the cases, then it did not provide any resolution for the relationships in question. In the Heraty et al. (2011) analysis, we refer to the by-eye alignment."
