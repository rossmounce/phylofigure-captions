"pone.0087901.g001.png","Phylogenetic tree construction for GnRHR-like receptors and evolutionary relationship of vertebrate GnRHRs genes.A, Amino acid sequences of vertebrate species (human, mouse, chicken, anole lizard, Xenopus, coelacanth, spotted gar, zebrafish, medaka, fugu, stickleback, tetraodon, and lamprey) and invertebrate species (C. elegans, Drosophila, Ciona, and amphioxus) were aligned using MUSCLE and the phylogeny tree was generated by MEGA 5.05. The human arginine vasopressin receptor 1a protein sequence was used as an outgroup. The vertebrate GnRHRs are grouped monophylogetically. The vertebrate gene types 1 and 2 are illustrated by green and orange, respectively. The arrows indicate the location of each vertebrate gene type on the ancestral linkage group. B, Prior to 2R, GnRHR types 1 and 2 emerged as a product of local duplication on the VAC A. Following 2R, a, b, and c subtypes of each ancestral type 1 and 2 were produced on GAC A0, GAC A4, and, GAC A5 respectively and GnRHR type 1a was translocated to GAC C1. During the evolution of vertebrate species some GnRHR subtypes have been lost or/and duplicated. The empty box indicates a pseudogene in a human chromosome. An empty box with a cross indicates loss of the gene."
