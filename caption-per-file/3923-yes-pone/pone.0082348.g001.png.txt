"pone.0082348.g001.png","Map (a) and maximum clade credibility tree (b) of SCSK G gene sequences used in the study.Posterior probabilities are shown for key nodes, and timescale is present at the bottom. To show the phylogenetic position of SCSK in the context of other related RABV lineages, several representative G gene sequences of raccoon RABV (RACCOON), north-central/central Mexican skunk RABV (MXSK), bat RABV (BAT) are shown, and a canine RABV is used as an outgroup."
