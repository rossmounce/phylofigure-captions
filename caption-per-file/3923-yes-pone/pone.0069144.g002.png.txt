Evolutionary relationships between the HIV-1 env genes in donor/recipient pair #1.The evolutionary history was inferred using the Neighbor-Joining method [38]. The optimal tree with the sum of branch length = 0.28572580 is shown. The tree is drawn to scale, with branch lengths in the same units as those of the evolutionary distances used to infer the phylogenetic tree. The evolutionary distances were computed using the Maximum Composite Likelihood method [39] and the unit is the number of base substitutions per site. Codon positions included were 1st+2nd+3rd+Noncoding. All positions containing gaps and missing data were eliminated from the dataset (Complete deletion option). There were a total of 500 positions in the final dataset. Phylogenetic analyses were conducted in MEGA4 [40]. For the recipient, viruses from PBMC-derived DNA (•) and plasma RNA (○) are represented. For the donor, strains from PBMC-derived DNA (▾) and plasma RNA (∇) are represented."
