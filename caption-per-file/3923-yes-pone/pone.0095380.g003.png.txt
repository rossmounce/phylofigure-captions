Syntenic and phylogenetic analysis of genes involved in urea hydrolysis.Arrangement and similarity of genes involved in the urea hydrolysis pathway C. symbiosum and SAGs (A), and an inferred phylogenetic tree of α-subunit of urease (ureC) gene sequences from SAGs and selected cultures and environmental samples (B). SAGs are colored according to source; red, South Pacific; blue, North Pacific. The scale bar indicates tblastx similarity values between genes. The tree was inferred using maximum likelihood in RAxML and bootstrap (1000 replicates) values ≥50% are indicated at nodes. C. symbiosum, Cenarchaeum symbiosum."
