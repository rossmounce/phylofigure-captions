Lack of host specificity and microevolution.A subtree of the phylogram in figure 1 depicting relatedness of invasive multidrug resistant S. Typhimurium strains from HIV-infected adults (A+) and children (C+) and HIV-uninfected children (C−) over time (2002–2008) including the epidemic strain D23580. The pre-epidemic chloramphenicol-susceptible S. Typhimurium strain A130 is included as an outgroup. The scale bar value 0.08 represents expected substitutions per site."
