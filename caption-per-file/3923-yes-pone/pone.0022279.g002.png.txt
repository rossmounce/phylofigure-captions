"pone.0022279.g002.png","ML phylogenetic tree of VEP1. The tree was inferred from 239 amino acid characters using the empirical replacement matrix of [61], setting amino acid frequencies as free parameters, gamma-distributed rates among sites (4 categories; α = 1.532), and a proportion of invariant sites (I = 0.060), referred to as LG+F+dG+I model. Non-parametric bootstrap (1000 replicates)/aLRT support scores greater than 50% are shown above the respective nodes. Light (right) and dark (left) background areas indicate, respectively, the sequences used for building the tree (identified using tBLASTn; >25% pairwise sequence identity), and the extant closest remote homologs of VEP1 (identified using remote homology searching methods), which were not used for tree building, but are shown to indicate this study's hypothesis about the evolutionary origin of VEP1. Subtrees subtending inferred bacteria-to-eukaryote LGT events are colored green (viridiplantae) and fucsia (fungi). Green and red dots next to the taxa labels indicate plant-associated non-phytopathogenic and phytopathogenic bacteria, respectively. α, β, γ, and δ denote Alpha-, Beta-, Gamma, and Epsilon-proteobacteria, respectively; Ac, Actinobacteria; Ba, Bacteroidetes; Ch, Chloroflexi; Fi, Firmicutes."
