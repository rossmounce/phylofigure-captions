"pone.0056341.g002.png","Rooted phylogenetic trees showing the relationships amongst HEV-A isolates using the different genomic regions.The neighbour-joining trees were constructed from alignment of the 5' UTR (a), P1 (b), P2 (c), P3 (d) and 3?UTR (e) genomic region, respectively. The percentage of bootstrap (percentage of 1000 pseudoreplicate datasets) replicates supporting the trees are indicated at the nodes; for clarity, only values over 80% are shown. The branch lengths are proportional to the genetic distances corrected using Kimura-two-parameter substitution model."
