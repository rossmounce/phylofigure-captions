"pone.0005227.g003.png","Unrooted tree of filaggrin-2 repeat domains together with typical domains of hornerin and profilaggrin.This neighbour-joining cladogram tree [68], depicting relationships among A- and B-type repeats, is constructed based on the alignment. The bootstrap consensus tree is inferred from 1000 replicates [69]. Branches corresponding to partitions reproduced in less than 50% bootstrap replicates are collapsed. The tree is drawn to scale, with branch lengths in the same units as those of the evolutionary distances used to infer the phylogenetic tree. All positions containing gaps and missing data were eliminated from the dataset (complete deletion option). There were a total of 71 positions in the final dataset. Phylogenetic analyses were conducted in MEGA4 [66]. Numbers in nodes correspond to bootstrap support values indicated as percentages."
