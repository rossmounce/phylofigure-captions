Phylogeny and PCR analysis of avian-specific miRNAs.The top part of this figure shows the phylogenetic tree of the species that we analyzed with the divergence nodes on a scale of millions of years (left). At the bottom are shown the results of gel electrophoresis of PCR products from each genomic DNA for pre-miRNA hairpin precursors for miR-1559, miR-2131, and miR-2954. Indicating that they are conserved across, but are specific to, the avian lineage. The hairpin precursor miR-100 is a positive control that is conserved across all vertebrates examined. The primers only lane is a negative control that lacks genomic DNA."
