"pone.0052802.g001.png","Amino acid sequence alignment and phylogenetic tree of COI1 and OsCOIs.A, Deduced amino acid sequences of COI1 and OsCOIs were aligned using the ClustalW program. Gray shading indicates identical residues. Approximately 55% identity was shown between COI and OsCOIs. Solid boxes indicate residues involved in the COI-coronatine complex. Dashed boxes indicate residues involved in the COI-JAZ interaction. Asterisks indicate amino acid residues involved in the COI-coronatine complex or COI-JAZ interaction, which shows the difference between coronatine and JAZ interactions. B, The phylogenetic tree of COI1 and OsCOIs. These results were drawn with DNAstar software."
