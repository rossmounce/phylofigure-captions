"pone.0022257.g001.png","Evolutionary conservation of NcoA4 and the ARA70 domains. Blastp analysis indicates that vertebrate NcoA4 contains two ARA70 family domains designated as ARA70-I and ARA70-II. These domains have no significant sequence identity with one another. Relative to H. sapiens, ARA70-I sequence identity (I) ranges from 94% to 34% and positivity (P) from 95% to 53% and is present in all orthologs. In contrast, ARA70-II, which is restricted to vertebrates, ranges from 70% to 37% sequence identity and 77% to 50% positivity. The E-values indicated for each ortholog are based upon the full-length sequence and are relative to H. sapiens. A rooted phylogenetic dendrogram based upon full-length sequence similarity is shown on the left and is consistent with the accepted evolutionary history of metazoans."
