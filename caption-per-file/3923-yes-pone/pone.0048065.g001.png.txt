Phylogenetic analysis of REF and SRPP protein family.A BlastP was realized on REF P15252 at http://www.phylogeny.fr. The accession numbers of each 24 aligned sequences with ClustalW (http://www.genome.jp/tools/clustalw/program) were as follows: REF Hevea brasiliensis P15252, REF Hevea brasiliensis AEH05970 (2), REF Hevea brasiliensis AAR11448 (3), SRPP Hevea brasiliensis O82803, SRPP Hevea brasiliensis AAO66432 (2), RLP1 Hevea brasiliensis AAP46159, RLP2 Hevea brasiliensis AAP46160, REF Ricinus communis XP_002512427, REF Arabidopsis thaliana NP_187201, SRP Vitis riparia Q9SW70, REF Morus alba ACV90044, REF Amblyomma maculatum AEO33677, SRP Ipomoea batatas ABP35522, SRP Oryza sativa AAO72547, SRP Zea mays ACG39345, REF Selaginella moellendorffii XP_002969776, SRPP Parthenium argentatum AAQ11374, SRP Capsicum annuum ADI60300, SRPP Ricinus communis XP_002514917, REF Populus trichocarpa XP_002319520, REF Arabidopsis lyrata XP_002882419, SRP Glycine max XP_003543052, REF/SRPP-like protein Medicago truncatula XP_003593563. Evolutionary analyses were conducted in MEGA5 [65] using the Neighbor-Joining method, the bootstrap test (1000 replicates) and the p-distance method. All positions containing gaps and missing data were eliminated. On the right, characterized proteins are presented. SRPP: Small Rubber Particle Protein; REF: Rubber Elongation Factor; SRP: Stress-related protein; RLP: REF-like stress related protein. Both REF and SRPP proteins used in this study are framed. Hevea brasiliensis protein family is framed by a gray dashed box."
