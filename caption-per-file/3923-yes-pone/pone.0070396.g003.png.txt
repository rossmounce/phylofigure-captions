"pone.0070396.g003.png","Simplified maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree of GAPH, shown as arbitrarily rooted with cyanobacterial sequences.Cytosolic GAPDH collapsed clades are coloured in blue. Gap A/B and Gap2 are in green, with GapC1 in red. Several ciliates form the immediate outgroup to GapC1 sequences, although without bootstrap support. Only bootstrap support values above 50 are shown. Several clades, indicated as Mixed Eukaryotic Groups, belong sequences from taxa that do not form monophyletic clades. Given the many paralogs included in this analysis, and the fact that it is a single gene phylogeny, this is not unexpected. In the majority of these groups taxa are predominantly from a single supergroup with the addition of a few “rogue” taxa. The full phylogenetic tree can be found in data S1."
