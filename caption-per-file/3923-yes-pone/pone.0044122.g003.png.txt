Neighbour-joining phylogenetic tree showing the relationships of the 201 sequences of bacterial amoA genes detected in the clone libraries constructed from samples from the soil column with their most similar sequences and the sequences of known AOB.The numbers at the nodes are percentages that indicate the levels of bootstrap support from 1000 replicates. The scale bar represents 0.05 nucleic acid substitutions per nucleotide position."
