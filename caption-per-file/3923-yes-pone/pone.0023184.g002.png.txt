"pone.0023184.g002.png","Genome-based phylogenetic analysis of L. garvieae. (A) Synteny between the L. garvieae and L. lactis subsp. lactis IL1403 chromosomes. Each plot point represents reciprocal best matches by BLASTP comparisons between orthologs. Genome numbering initiated at dnaA for both chromosomes. Shaded region indicates the location of the capsule gene cluster in the Lg2 genome. (B) Phylogenetic relationships between the genomes of sequenced Streptococcaceae inferred from 27 concatenated ribosomal protein amino acid sequences. The scale bar represents branch length. Reliability of internal branches was assessed using the bootstrap method with 1,000 pseudo-replicates. Bootstrap values greater than 70% are indicated at the nodes. Scale bar represents the number of substitutions per site. An unrooted tree was generated using NJplot."
