Genetic lineages of the H. spelea complex and their geographic distributions.Representative phylogram based on Bayesian analysis of nine nDNA loci of the Heteronotia spelea complex plus outgroups from Pepper et al. (2011). Values refer to Bayesian posterior probabilities. The outline of Australia shows the distribution of the Pilbara and central Australian lineages, while the insets show the detailed topography of these regions with sample localities colored to match the phylogeny. The distribution of H. fasciolatussp. nov. and H. atrasp. nov. are indicated with green and pink stars, respectively."
