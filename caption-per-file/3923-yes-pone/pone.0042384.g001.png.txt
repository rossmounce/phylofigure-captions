A. Distribution of spotted kiwi haplotypes. The current distribution of great spotted kiwi is depicted in green. Little spotted kiwi presently (2012) occur on several predator-free offshore islands and a wildlife sanctuary on the mainland (not shown); all derive from transfers from Kapiti Island or D’Urville Island (little spotted kiwi have been removed from the latter). Little spotted kiwi haplotypes are represented by circles; great spotted kiwi samples are indicated by diamonds. Only the approximate position of the sample from ‘West Coast, South Island’ (museum number AV25141) is indicated on the map because of the imprecision of its recorded locality. A star indicates the position of the sample (AV17079) from which a partial DNA sequence identical to the control region of haplotype A was obtained. B. Distribution of brown kiwi haplotypes. The current distribution of North Island brown kiwi is shown in blue and their haplotypes are shown as pentagons. The distribution of rowi is shown in red and their haplotypes as triangles. The distribution of tokoeka is shown in grey and tokoeka haplotypes are shown as squares. In both maps the location names of ancient samples are shown in bold and underlined. C. Midpoint-rooted Bayesian phylogeny of the expanded sample set which included all spotted and brown kiwi samples and all loci (missing loci were coded as missing data). Numbers above the branches represent posterior probabilities (PP), MP and ML bootstrap (BS) values, respectively. Only PP>0.70 and BS>50% are shown."
