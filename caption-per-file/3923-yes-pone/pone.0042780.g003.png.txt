"pone.0042780.g003.png","Neighbour-joining phylogenetic analysis of ITS DNA barcodes for all dinoflagellates from culture collections in this study and from GenBank.Using uncorrected p-distances. Most species could be accurately identified with ITS which showed cryptic speciation in Scrippsiella, Heterocapsa, Oxyrrhis and Karlodinium. Strain labels were removed for clarity but are available in Figure S1 and also listed in Table S1. Abbreviations: S. sp. : Scrippsiella species; Sym: Symbiodinium. Brackets represent species groups as identified using criteria described in methods and results. GB indicates a genbank deposited strain."
