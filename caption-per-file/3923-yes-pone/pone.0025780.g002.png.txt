An exemplar simulation of a clade in decline. Rates of increase and decline used correspond to the slow relative rate of decline from Figure 1B. A) Exemplar phylogeny. The pink portion represents the decline in diversity phase. The dashed lines represent points in time where the γ value and diversity of each phylogeny was assessed. B) The number of extant species at each point in time for decline phase. C) The γ statistic for what would have been the molecular phylogeny at each point in time for the decline phase."
