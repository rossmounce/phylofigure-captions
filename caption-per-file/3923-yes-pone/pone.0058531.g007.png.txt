"pone.0058531.g007.png","Neighbor-joining (NJ) bootstrap consensus tree of partial 16S rRNA gene (1412 bp) illustrating phylogenetic relationship among fluorescent Pseudomonas spp. isolated from inside rhizomes 17 months after inoculation.The first number in strain codes indicates the treatment number from the inoculation experiment (Table 2). The analyses were done with MEGA version 5 [6], and the numbers at each node represent bootstrap value (1000 replicates). Scale bar: substitutions/site."
