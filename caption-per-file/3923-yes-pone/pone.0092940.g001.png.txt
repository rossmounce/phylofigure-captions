Genus level phylogenetic tree of carious lesion-associated microbiota.The phylogenetic tree was generated using maximum likelihood in the program RAxML (version 7.0.4, CIPRES webserver [52]), and graphically displayed using iTOL [71]. Genera are coloured according to their corresponding phylum. The outer band shows the overall abundance of each genus as well as relative abundance in pH group."
