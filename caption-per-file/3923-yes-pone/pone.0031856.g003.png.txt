"pone.0031856.g003.png","Bayesian phylogenetic tree of fungal FHbs. Bayesian tree based on a MAFFT v.6.850 alignment of 62 fungal FHb globin domains using two plant nonsymbiotic Hbs as outgroup. Support values at branches represent Bayesian posterior probabilities (>0.5). The sequences are identified by the first three letters of the binary species name, the number of residues, and the full phylum and family names (see Table S1). Sac â€“ Saccharomycetes."
