"pone.0033560.g002.png","Maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree generated from seven concatenated TB domains of each fibrillin. The fibrillin protein family is grouped into four separate clades (from bottom to top): single fibrillin (Fbn), fibrillin-1 (Fbn-1), fibrillin-2 (Fbn-2), and fibrillin-3 (Fbn-3). Bootstrap values shown on each node represent the percentage of trees (out of 1,000) yielding the same two-set partition of sequences. The Jones-Taylor-Thornton model with invariant sites and a gamma distribution with four discrete categories was used. The tree was re-rooted around the base of the single fibrillin clade. The scale bar indicates the estimated average number of expected substitutions per site. Analyses of full length fibrillins or of full length fibrillins lacking the unique region resulted in similar phylogenetic trees."
