"pone.0015506.g001.png","Phylogenetic tree and exon-intron structure of Group I Nme in Eukaryotes and synteny conservation between human and starlet sea anemone Group I Nme. A. The phylogenetic tree was constructed from a single multiple sequence alignment. Bootstrap values for neighbor joining, maximum parsimony, and maximum likelihood methods, respectively, are indicated for each node. Asterisks (*) indicate that the node was not recovered by the corresponding phylogenetic method. The consensus midpoint-rooted tree was calculated using the FIGENIX automated phylogenomic annotation pipeline [41]. For each sequence, species and corresponding name are shown. B. Corresponding exon/intron structures of genes coding for the proteins used for the phylogenetic tree estimation. Exon/intron structure was obtained through Ensembl, NCBI or JGI databases. When exon boundaries correspond to identical amino acid positions, the exons are displayed in color. Otherwise, exons are displayed in black. Non-coding exons are shown in grey. Exon size (in nucleotides) is indicated above each box. C. Synteny analysis between Nematostella vectensis NmeGp1 genes and human group I NME genes. Nematostella vectensis gene names are NCBI Entrez gene symbols. For clarity reasons “NEMVEDRAFT_” was removed from all gene symbols. Duplication time estimations are from TimeTree [46]."
