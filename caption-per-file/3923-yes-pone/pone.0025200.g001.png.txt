Characterization of the fecal microbiota in eighteen subjects that consumed increasing doses of GOS by multiplex pyrosequencing of 16S rDNA tags. A phylogenetic tree that encompasses the phylum Actinobacteria is shown (A). The tree contains representative sequences of all OTUs detected that were significantly affected by GOS in individual subjects together with sequences of related entries in the database. The latter includes both type strains of known species and sequences from molecular studies of human fecal samples. Sequences were aligned using Muscle 3.6 and the trees were constructed using the neighbor-joining algorithm with 1,000 bootstrap replicates in MEGA 4.0. The sequences from individual subjects are labeled using open black and closed black symbols, and type strains and other sequenced human strains are indicated by grey symbols. Those OTUs that were not significantly affected in all eighteen subjects were labeled as “No significance”. Graphs to the right of the trees show the abundance of the OTUs and bacterial groups that were significantly affected by GOS. The abundances of all of the Bifidobacterium species affected by GOS consumption, for all eighteen subjects, are shown in B. These graphs show mean proportions of the three individual samples taken during the treatment periods for each subject. Baseline and washout refer to samples taken in periods where no GOS was consumed. Repeated measures ANOVA in combination with a Tukey's post-hoc test were performed to indentify differences between treatment and control periods, where * = p"
