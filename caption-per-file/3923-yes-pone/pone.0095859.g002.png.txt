"pone.0095859.g002.png","Alignment and phylogenetic analysis of Ca-AIF1 amino acid sequences with other animal AIF-1s.(A) Multiple alignment. Conserved amino acids were shaded and each shade represents a degree of conservation (black, 100%, grey, 70%). The alignment was taken by ClustalX program. (B) Phylogenetic analysis was performed by MEGA (version 3.1) program based on the AIF-1 amino acid sequences from various animals. The phylogenetic tree was constructed using neighbor-joining method and bootstrap 1000. The human calcium binding protein was taken as out-group root."
