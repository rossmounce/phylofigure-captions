"pone.0075794.g001.png","Phylogenetic relationships among representative strains of phytopathogenic Pseudomonas species and P. syringae pathovars.The phylogenetic tree was constructed using 6,579 concatenated nucleotides of seven housekeeping genes (argS, dnaQ, gltA, gyrB, recA, rpoB and rpoD) with bootstrap values greater than 65 per cent (1,000 replicates) shown at the nodes. The phylogenetic relationships were inferred using the maximum likelihood (ML) method and the GTR I G as the best model with the PHYLIP package. Strain members of genomospecies 8 (P. avellanae) sensu Gardan et al. [5], including also P. s. pv. morsprunorum M302280, are shown in red, whereas strain members of genomospecies 2 (P. s. pv. lachrymans M302278) and 3 (P. s. pv. tomato) are in blue. P. fluorescens A506 and P. putida UW4 were included as outgroups."
