Reconstructed phylogeny of the Vampyrellida in a cercozoan context based on SSU rDNA sequence comparisons. Shown is the best maximum likelihood tree obtained by RAxML analyses of 81 sequences using 1640 aligned characters. The order Vampyrellida as well as the families Vampyrellidae and Leptophryidae are shaded in yellow/red colours, the remaining two deep-branching endomyxan clades in grey. The branch containing ‘Novel Clades’ 10–12 and some members of the ‘core Filosa’ are defined as outgroup. For previously published sequences taxonomic names and accession numbers are given. Sequences without taxonomic designations are environmental sequences and newly obtained sequences are combined with the strain designation only and are in bold (for accession numbers see Table 1). The support values of all methods applied are shown on the respective branches in the following order: ML/NJ/MP/BI. Support values less than 50% or 0.5 are not shown (−), whereas bold branches were maximally supported by all methods (100/100/100/1.00). Interrupted branches (//) show 50% of their original length. NC = ‘Novel Clade’ according to Bass & Cavalier-Smith (2004) and Bass et al. (2008) [11], [38]."
