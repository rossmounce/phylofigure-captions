"pone.0009457.g001.png","Plausible models of evolution for the inhibin/activin gene family.A) Simplified species tree for animals based upon recent large-scale analyses [93], [94], [95]. “WGD” indicates the position of the whole genome duplications [29] uniting vertebrates and letters indicate alternative models for the origin of the α-subunit (the letters used correspond to the parts of this figure). B) Cladogram showing the expected inhibin/activin phylogeny given the “early vertebrate duplication” model. Two rounds of WGD have been suggested to characterize vertebrates [28], [29], [30] and we show the only topology consistent both with two rounds of WGD and a clade containing INHBA-INHBB (the latter clade is strongly-supported in this study and in other studies; [27], [96]. C) Cladogram showing the expected phylogeny of inhibin/activin genes given the “deuterostome duplication” model, which places the α-subunit origin before the early vertebrate WGDs. Several versions of this model are possible (i.e., the α-subunit origin could predate the divergence of vertebrates from urochordates, cephalochordates, or even echinoderms). D) Cladogram showing the expected inhibin/activin phylogeny given the “early animal duplication” model, which places the α-subunit origin before the divergence of deuterosomes and protostomes. The “Dawdle orthologue” hypothesis is a version of this model. Additional duplications may have occurred in any of these models. Biased estimation of the gene tree or sampling variance may cause estimates of the gene tree to deviate from any of these idealized model trees."
