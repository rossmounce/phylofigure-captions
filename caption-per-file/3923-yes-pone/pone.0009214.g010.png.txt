"pone.0009214.g010.png","Phylogenetic and temporal distribution of H1N1sw isolates.Figure 10A shows the phylogenetic distribution of H1N1sw isolates based on complete amino acid neuraminidase sequences. The label of each strain includes the GenBank number, the country of origin, the time of collection and the amino acid pattern at residue positions 106 and 248 of the neuraminidase protein. Figure 10B shows the temporal distribution of strains harbouring the VN or ID amino acid pattern at residue positions 106 and 248 of the neuraminidase protein. Figure 10B: Green circle: strains with VN pattern. Pink triangle: strains with ID pattern. Dark blue square: strains with VD pattern. Light blue square: strains with IN pattern."
