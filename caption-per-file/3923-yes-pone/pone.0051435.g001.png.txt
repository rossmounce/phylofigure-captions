"pone.0051435.g001.png","Phylogeny and expression patterns of Bsister genes.Bayesian phylogeny of class D, class B and Bsister genes in seed plants. Posterior probabilities are indicated on the nodes. The expression patterns of Bsister and class D genes are depicted as far as they are known. Colors indicate expression intensity: white, no expression; light grey, weak expression; dark grey, strong expression; asterisk, expression was detected particularly in endothelial cells of inner integument; n, no expression data available; cross, tissue or organ is not present in respective species."
