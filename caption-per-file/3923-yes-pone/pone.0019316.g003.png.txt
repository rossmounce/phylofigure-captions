"pone.0019316.g003.png","Phylogeny of clade A-associated CooS sequences. Protein phylogeny was determined by Phylip ProML maximum-likelihood analysis of 423 unambiguously aligned and filtered amino acid positions. Support for the tree was calculated by 100 bootstrap-step reanalysis of the dataset using protein maximum-likelihood methods and is reported for nodes with greater than 50% support. Sequences recovered from insect gut inventories are indicated as follows: termite sequences (green) are from Z. nevadensis, Zn; R. hesperus, Rh; and I. minor, Im; wood-feeding cockroach sequences (blue) are from C. punctulatus adult, CpA and nymph, CpN; omnivorous cockroach sequences (red) are from P. americana, Pa. %G+C content of cooS genes for each translated amino acid sequence is given parenthetically. Group A1, indicated by a gray box, contains CooS sequences putatively assigned to the genus Treponema based on phylogenetic inference. Bar indicates distance given as 0.1 changes per amino acid position."
