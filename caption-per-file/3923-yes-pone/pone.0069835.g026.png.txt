"pone.0069835.g026.png","Time-calibrated phylogram of Lambeosaurinae based on the phylogenetic hypothesis shown in Fig.25. Each of the five most parsimonious trees resulting from parsimony analysis is shown. However, because those trees differ only in the relationships of the Hypacrosaurus-Amurosaurus clade, we only show the complete topology of one of the threes and include below only the topologies of that subclade for the additional four most parsimonious trees. The circles at each node represent the relative probabilities for the ancestral areas inferred using Statistical Dispersal-Vicariance Analysis (S-DIVA [104]), implemented in RASP 2.0b [127]. The numbers to the left of the taxon names are datings in millions of years. When absolute dating estimates are not available but only subages (e.g., late Maastrichtian), the absolute dating of the taxon is approximated as the mid-point of the available range (numbers between brackets). The literature sources for each taxon?s geochronological range are as follows: Amurosaurus riabinini (late Maastrichtian range for the Udurchukan Formation [64]); Aralosaurus tuberiferus (late Santonian-early Campanian range for the Bostobe Formation [43]); Arenysaurus ardevoli and Blasisaurus canudoi (late Maastrichtian; Fig. 2); Charonosaurus jiayinensis (late Maastrichtian range for the Yuliangze Formation [60]); Canardia garonnensis (late Maastrichtian up to near the K-Pg boundary; Fig. 2); Corythosaurus spp., Lambeosaurus spp., and Parasaurolophus walkeri[98]; Hypacrosaurus altispinus[49]; H. stebingeri (?middle? to late Campanian range for the upper section of the Two Medicine Formation [1]); Magnapaulia laticaudus[131]; Jaxartosaurus aralensis (Santonian range for the Syuksyuk Formation [132]); Olorotitan arharensis (late Maastrichtian range for the Udurchukan Formation [6]); Pararhabdodon isonensis (late to latest Maastrichtian; Fig. 2); Parasaurolophus tubicen and P. cyrtocristatus[133]; Sahaliyania elunchunorum (late Maastrichtian range for the Yuliangze Formation according to Godefroit et al. 2008); Tsintaosaurus spinorhinus (early Campanian range for the Jingangkou Formaton [134]); and Velafrons coahuilensis[135]. Datings for age boundaries are from Walker et al. [136]."
