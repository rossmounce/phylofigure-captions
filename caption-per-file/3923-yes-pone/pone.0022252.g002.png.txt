Tanglegram for the Chrysoviridae and their hosts. The parasite supermatrix was constructed using RASCAL and GBLOCKS alignment filtering, and the ‘theory’ host distances were used. All links were insignificant according to the ParaFit test, which also accepted the global null hypothesis of no correspondence between host and Chrysoviridae phylogenies. The numbers on the branches within the parasite tree are maximum-likelihood bootstrap values ≥60%. Host branches are colored according to their deep taxonomic affiliations: blue, Fungi; light blue, Ascomycota. Stars on the host branches indicate those that were obtained by randomly resolving polytomies; all other branches were derived from the host classification."
