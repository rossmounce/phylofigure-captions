Phylogenetic tree, protein domains, and exon-intron structure of Nme6 in Eukaryotes. A. The phylogenetic midpoint-rooted tree was constructed as described in Figure 1A. B. Corresponding protein domain structure was obtained as described in Figure 2A. C. Exon/intron gene structure was obtained as described in Figure 1B."
