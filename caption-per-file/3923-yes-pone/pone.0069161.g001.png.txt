Sc-SRP-6 shares RCL signatures and has phylogenetic relationships with parasitic nematode serpins.A: Multiple alignment of the C-terminus of serpins from different species highlight a conserved GVTA motif (346?349), the serpin signature INADRP (373?378) and a predicted P1?P1? cleavage site (Met360?Sep361). High variability is observed in the region immediately proximal to P1 position of the RSL. B: Phylogenetic tree reconstructed by Maximum Likelihood using PhyML with robustness assessed by the bootstrap method (1000 pseudoreplicates). Human serpin was used as an outgroup to root the phylogeny. Alignments were performed with the amino-acid sequences of the following serpins: Caenorhabditis briggsae Cbr-SRP-3 (XP_002647307); C. elegans Cel-SRP-3 (NP_503528); Brugia malayi Bml-SRP-1 (AAB65745), BML-SRP-2 (XP_001893428) and BML-SRP-3 (XP_001896647); Trichinella sp. Tr-SRP (ABI32311); Ascaris suum Asn-SRP-1 (ADY44079); and Anisakis simplex Asm-SRP-1 (CBX25525) and Human Hsa-SRP-1 (ABV21360)."
