Morpho-functional chewing grades and muroid phylogeny.This phylogeny is adapted from complementary results from the three most recent molecular phylogenies [13]–[15] and some palaeontological hypotheses [22]–[25]. The phylogenetic position of Platacanthomyidae has not been investigated yet with molecular data. We inferred the chewing grade of taxa whose direction of chewing has already been published or was measured in this study (See Table 4). B: grade B; C: grade C; D: grade D; O: grade O; M: grade M; †: fossil taxa. 1: Platacanthomyidae; 2: Spalacidae; 3: Calomyscidae; 4: Nesomyidae. 5: Muridae; 6: Cricetidae."
