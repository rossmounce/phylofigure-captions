Chasmosaurine ceratopsid phylogeny from Sampson et al. [40] with taxa time calibrated to known geologic occurrences.Numbers in brackets indicate the midpoint of a geologic stage that a taxon is known to occur if that species does not have more constrained stratigraphic ages. Symbols on phylogenetic branches designate the inheritance of geographic distribution based on results from the DIVA analyses. Note that Torosaurus and Triceratops both appeared on the Sampson et al. [40] phylogeny used in this study; and that in light of recent work documenting these taxa as congeneric [68], they remain as distinct genera within the present figure in order to maintain the original data integrity of the Sampson et al. [40] study, but are considered and discussed here as solely Triceratops."
