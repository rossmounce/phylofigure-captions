"pone.0014376.g005.png","A phylogenetic tree for ORF2.N.This tree was constructed using a strict clock with a constant growth prior. The numbers at each tree node are the mean values for TMRCA at that node. The numbers across the bottom of the figure are the times in years from the calculated TMRCA for the ancestor of genotypes 1â€“4. Each genotype clade is labeled, and the rabbit, 3.1 and 3.2 clades are labeled within the genotype 3 clade. The genotype 3 subtypes included in each clade can be found in Table S1. Each sequence is labeled with its GenBank accession number followed by its genotype and two digit designation for its year of collection."
