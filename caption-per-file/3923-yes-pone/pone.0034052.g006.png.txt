"pone.0034052.g006.png","Recombination of domains between LysinAs. ClustalW alignments of four LysA proteins were used to construct a phylogenetic tree for the N-terminal and amidase domains. A. Proteins are identified by phage name, gp#, and Organizations. B. and C. Tree illustrating the most parsimonious phylogeny for the (B) N-terminal and (C) amidase domains. Bootstrap values are 100 for the division of recombination between the domains, and an SH test rejected alternate topologies (P-value "
