"pone.0085343.g012.png","The neighbor-joining phylogenetic analysis of Cyclin B protein.Phylogenetic tree of aligned amino-acid sequences of cyclin B from Artemia sinica and 14 other species. A neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree was constructed using cyclin B sequences from A. sinica and 15 other sequences in GenBank, using the sequence analysis tool MEGA 4.1. The sequences and their accession numbers are indicated in the legend of Fig. 11. Circle (?) indicates cyclin B from A. sinica."
