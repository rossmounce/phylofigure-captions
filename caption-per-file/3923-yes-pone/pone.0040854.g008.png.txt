Phylogenetic tree of GH family 18 ENGases, group B.The phylogenetic tree is based on an amino acid sequence alignment (CLUSTALX) and was constructed by neighbour joining. Bootstrap values are based on 1000 replications and nodes that have bootstrap support above 70% are indicated with the percentage. The tree is rooted with fungal GH family 18 chitinases belonging to the same subgroup. Previously characterized ENGases are indicated with an asterisk*. Boxes indicate proteins belonging to micro-organisms of the same order as described in the text."
