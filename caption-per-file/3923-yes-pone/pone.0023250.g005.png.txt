Phylogenetic analyses of the O157-antigen gene cluster-flanking regions. The phylogenetic trees were constructed based on concatenated sequences of yeeFYZ, wcaMLK, wzxC-wcaJ-cpsG, cpsB-wcaIHG and wzc-wzb-wza by neighbor-joining method using Tamura-Nei model. O157 strains carrying “Sakai-type rfbE” and “PV01-185-type rfbE” are indicated by clear and gray boxes, respectively. Colors (red, green and blue) indicate their E. coli phylogroups (A, B1 and B2), respectively."
