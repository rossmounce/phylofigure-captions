"pone.0050076.g002.png","Comparison of the respective phylogenetic trees inferred from the mass sampling (MS, D680), using Maximum Parsimony (MP), Bayesian inference (BI), and Maximum Likelihood (ML).Clades have been transformed into triangles using the ""collapse"" option in TreeEdit. Gray triangles indicate the respective outgroup and sister clades; blue triangles refer to “Cam” clades containing at least one accession of Campanula (Cam01 to Cam17; see text). Numbers below branches are the respective MP-jackknife (MP), posterior probability (BI), and ML-bootstrap (ML) values; numbers above branches are MP-bootstrap values (MP)."
