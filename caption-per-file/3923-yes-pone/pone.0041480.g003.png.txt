"pone.0041480.g003.png","Minimum evolution phylogenetic tree of concatenated gene sequences from all 91 P. acnes eSTs.The tree was constructed using concatenated sequences (4253 bp) from each eST. The sequence input order was randomized, and bootstrapping resampling statistics were performed using 500 data sets. Bootstrap values are shown on the arms of the tree. Horizontal bar represents genetic distance. Coloured vertical bars on the right relate to eBURST groupings or clonal complexes. The colour scheme relating to each eBURST group is described, with singletons highlighted in red. Culture collection strain NCTC737 (type IA1) is represented by eST1 (ST18, Arahus), KPA171202 by eST5 (ST36, Arahus), CCUG32901 by eST5 (ST36, Arahus) and ATCC11828 by eST27 (novel ST, Arahus)."
