"pone.0092234.g002.png","Sequence analysis of ArSLK.(A) Alignment of the amino acid sequence of the N-terminal kinase domain of ArSLK with those of SLKs from other species. The Ste20 signature sequence is highlighted and conserved amino acid residues are indicated by asterisks. The black shaded areas represent identical amino acid residues. (B) Analysis of the coiled-coil region of the ArSLK. The probability of formation of a coiled-coil structure was calculated for each residue with a window of 28 amino acids using the ‘COILS’ program. (C) Phylogenetic analysis of the amino acid sequences of SLKs from multiple species. GenBank accession numbers of the sequences used in the amino acid alignment and phylogenetic analysis are as follows: Artemia parthenogenetica, KC818632; Drosophila melanogaster, NP_726441; Aedes aegypti, XP_001649074; Daphnia pulex, EFX76394; Danio rerio, NP_001139073; Homo sapiens, NP_055535; Xenopus laevis, NP_001079164. Cluex quinquefasciatus, XP_001864707; Nasonia vitripennis, XP_001603525; Xenopus troplicalis, NP_001072623; Mus musculus, NP_033315; Schistosoma mansoni, AAN72832; Clonorchis sinensis, GAA30009."
