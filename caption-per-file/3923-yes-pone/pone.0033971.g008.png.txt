"pone.0033971.g008.png","E. coli O104:H4 phylogenies constructed after the removal of the 125 gene involved in recombination in ON2010. A), maximum likelihood tree of the concatenated sequences of 3669 genes (3487410 characters). All branches are 100% bootstrap supported. B), feature frequency profiles (FFPs) tree. C), neighbor-joining tree based on the number of alleles that differ between any two strains. D), neighbor-joining tree based on the number of alleles that have none-zero DNA distance between any two strains. Unlike in C, small indels, including homopolymer sequencing errors, were not considered in D."
