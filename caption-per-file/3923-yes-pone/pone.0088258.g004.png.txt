Phylogenetic diversity of low-level viremia.For each RM, phylograms represent RT-SHIV LLV sequences that were obtained between weeks 18 and 50 PI. Sequences were derived by SGA using plasma vRNA samples that were collected after maximal viral load suppression (<50 vRNA copies/mL) was initially achieved. There were a total of 437 nucleotide positions in the alignment encoding reverse transcriptase amino acids 65 to 210. Neighbor-joining phylograms were constructed as described in Figure 2 and were rooted on the consensus sequence of the RT-SHIV inoculum (open black circle). Each asterisk denotes that the indicated LLV sequence contained a single mutation which was not observed in the pre-suppression variant profile. The identity of these mutations has been annotated on the phylograms in black lettering. Drug resistance mutations to compounds which were not used in this study are annotated in red lettering to the right of LLV sequence in which they were observed. These mutations are associated with resistance to the NNRTI Nevirapine (S162N and Q174R) and the NNRTIs Etravirine and Rilpivirine (E138K). Finally, sequences pertaining to the putative predominant plasma clone sequence identified in RM Mmu 37969 have been annotated ?PPC?. These sequences were observed at four separate time points (weeks 34, 45, 47, and 50 PI)."
