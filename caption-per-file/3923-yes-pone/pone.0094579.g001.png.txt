The VP1 and 5′UTR phylogeny of EV-C species.A phylogenetic tree constructed from partial VP1 (343 nucleotides) (left) and 5′UTRs (the first 540 nucleotides of consensus alignment) (right) of CVA-21, CVA-24, EV-C95, EV-C96 and EV-C99 strains, EV-C prototype strains and strains retrieved from the GenBank that had more than 95% similarity in 5′UTR with the strains sequenced in this study. The types of the strains (defined as more than 75% nucleotide and more than 88% amino acid similarities in the VP1 region [3], [4]) are indicated with colours (CVA-21 red; CVA-24 green; CVA-24v dark green; EV-C96 orange; EV-C99 blue). Sub-trees that are shown in Fig 2 are indicated with arrows. The trees were constructed using the Neighbour-Joining method and the Tamura-Nei substitution model. The bootstrap support values were calculated for 1000 replicates. The bootstrap support values >70 are shown."
