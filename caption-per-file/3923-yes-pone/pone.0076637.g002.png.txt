"pone.0076637.g002.png","Comparison of the Tal2 locus between species.(A) Alignment of the human and murine Tal2 protein sequence. The colour code gives identical and divergent amino-acids, with identical amino-acids marked in red. The position of the basic motif and the helix-loop-helix motif is shown. (B) Comparison of the Tal2 protein sequence between different species is shown as phylogenic tree comparing the number of amino acid substitutions and as percent identity. The human sequence represents the 100% value, highlighted in bold. (C) Comparison of the genomic 5â€™-regions of Tal2 using the ECR-browser, screenshot. The human sequence served as the reference genome. The degree of conservation is visualized by the height of the curve belonging to the corresponding species. Evolutionary conserved regions (ECRs) are shown as a bar in peach colour above the curve. The position of the ATG start codon is given (black arrow) and a region of homology loss between human and rhesus macaque is marked (orange arrow). A conserved region, except in mouse, is marked with a star."
