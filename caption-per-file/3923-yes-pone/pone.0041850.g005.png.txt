"pone.0041850.g005.png","Phylogenetic maximum likelihood tree of the paralemmin downstream gene (PDG) family.This family includes all identified homologs of the known AKAP2 genes. The PDG isoforms are named for the paralemmin genes to which they are adjacent, with the exception of PDG4, which are adjacent to PALMD genes. The phylogenetic analysis of this family, as well as the chromosomal data, are consistent with our proposed duplication scheme (Figure 6) and the phylogenetic analysis of the paralemmins (Figure 3), but also show a duplication of the region bearing PALM3 in teleost fishes, probably through 3R."
