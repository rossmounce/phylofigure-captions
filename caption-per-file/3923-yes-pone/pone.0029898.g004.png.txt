DNA-distance based neighbor-joining phylogeny dendrograms for LT-II loci. The evolutionary history was inferred using the Neighbor-Joining method [58]. The bootstrap consensus tree inferred from 500 replicates is taken to represent the evolutionary history of the taxa analyzed [59]. Branches corresponding to partitions reproduced in less than 50% bootstrap replicates are collapsed. The percentage of replicate trees in which the associated taxa clustered together in the bootstrap test (500 replicates) are shown next to the branches [59]. The trees are drawn to scale, with branch lengths in the same units as those of the evolutionary distances used to infer the phylogenetic tree. The evolutionary distances were computed using the Maximum Composite Likelihood method [60] and are in the units of the number of base substitutions per site. The analyses all involved 6 nucleotide sequences. Codon positions included were 1st+2nd+3rd. All positions containing gaps and missing data were eliminated. There were a total of 1117 (A), 1135 (B,) 780 (C) and 366 (D) positions in the final datasets respectively. Evolutionary analyses were conducted in MEGA5 [22]. A - Dendrogram obtained using all LT-II loci as input sequences B - Dendrogram obtained using only LT-IIc sequences C – Dendrogram obtained using only LT-IIc-A gene sequences D – Dendrogram obtained using only LT-IIc-B gene sequences."
