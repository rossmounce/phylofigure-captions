"pone.0050827.g001.png","Eukaryotic phylogeny based on nuclear-encoded protein sequences using 6,048 aa (modified from the data matrix of Nozaki et al.[27]), including (A) and excluding (B) the intracellular endoparasites apicomplexans.The analysis is based on the concatenated dataset of slowly evolving nuclear proteins (21 proteins; 6,048 amino acid positions). The tree was determined using RAxML with the WAG+I+4G model. Numbers on the left, middle, or right side at the branches represent BV (?50%) obtained using 1,000 replicates with the RAxML, PhyML (WAG+I+4G), or MP analysis, respectively. Asterisks at the branches indicate 100% BV by all three methods."
