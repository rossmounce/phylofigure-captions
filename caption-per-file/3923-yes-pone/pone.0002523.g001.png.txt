Unrooted phylogenetic tree showing the relationships of the cCP gene sequences of 227 potyvirids including 183 potyviruses.The ‘other potyvirids’ include species of Macluravirus (maclura mosaic, Narcissus latent and cardamom mosaic viruses), Bymovirus (barley mild mosaic, barley yellow mosaic, oat mosaic, wheat spindle streak mosaic and wheat yellow mosaic viruses), Tritimovirus (brome streak mosaic, oat necrotic mottle and wheat streak mosaic viruses), Ipomovirus (cucumber vein yellowing and sweet potato mild mottle viruses) and Rymovirus (ryegrass mosaic, Agropyron mosaic and Hordeum mosaic viruses). BVY is blackberry virus Y; an unassigned potyvirid species. The tree was calculated from the cCP regions using the PhyML program with the HKY+I+G model."
