"pone.0048931.g002.png","Consensus phylogenetic tree of the vertebrate kisspeptin receptors (Kissr).This phylogenetic tree was constructed based on the amino-acid sequences of Kissr (for the references of each sequence see Table S2) using the Maximum Likelihood method with 1,000 bootstrap replicates. The number shown at each branch node indicates the bootstrap value (%); only values and branching above 70% are indicated. The tree was rooted using the two sequences of the hemichordata acorn worm GPR54-1 and GPR54-2 and the two sequences of echinodermata purple sea urchin Kissr_short and Kissr_long. The European eel Kissr and predicted coelacanth and spotted gar Kissr are coloured in red, blue and green, respectively."
