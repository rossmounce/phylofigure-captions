"pone.0060116.g002.png","The phylogenetic tree of htp genes based on CDS.Node labels indicate aLRT SH-like branch support values. The htp genes found from non-streptococcal species are shaded. For each gene, the CDS number in its genome is found behind the species name. Arrows in different colors are used to represent htp I or htp II genes. Asterisks (*) are used to indicate the represented gene when a species has tandem duplicated htp genes."
