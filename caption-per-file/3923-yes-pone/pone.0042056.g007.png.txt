Phylogeny of polyneopteran orders. (A) Bayesian inference phylogeny obtained with the dataset PCG123RNA; (B) Bayesian inference phylogeny obtained with the dataset PCG12RNA. The numbers associated with the nodes are posterior probabilities obtained by BI analysis with the dataset PCG12RNA (first) or bootstrap values obtained by ML analysis with the dataset PCG12RNA (second) and ML analysis with the dataset PCG123RNA (third). The species of Collembola and Diplura were utilized as outgroups to root the trees. The scale bar indicates the number of substitutions per site."
