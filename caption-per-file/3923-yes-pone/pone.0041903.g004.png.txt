The “polymorphism” and “co-residence” scenarios are two alternative hypotheses for the evolution of the VL.The loci represented on the left and right of the figure depict alternative ancestral states. Species phylogenies are labeled with the minimal events required to generate the VLA, VLB, and VLC conformations described in this study."
