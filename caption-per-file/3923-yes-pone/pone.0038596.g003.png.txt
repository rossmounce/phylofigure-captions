Correlation of Salmonella phylogenomic groups with specific collections of FGCs.On the left, phylogenomic tree of 90 Salmonella and two E. coli control strains, based on 45 highly conserved house-keeping genes totaling âˆ¼43 Kb. Clade 1 to 4 correspond to the clades shown in Figure 2, and clade 5 includes the few sequenced genomes from strains that were not S. enterica, subsp. I. The scale indicates the number of substitutions per nucleotide. On the top and heat map, hierarchical clustering support tree for the FGCs (MeV, complete linkage method with an euclidean distance threshold of 9.525, http://www.tm4.org). FGCs with or without pseudogenes were shown as green or red rectangles, respectively. On the right, Salmonella serovars (somatic O and flagellar H antigens)."
