"pone.0067231.g004.png","Unrooted phylogenetic tree reconstructed using the hypervariable sequence amplified on BYDV-Ker-I isolates using RT-PCR2 assay.Corresponding sequences from all BYDV-PAV isolates present in GenBank were included in the analysis and the relevant accession numbers are indicated. For Kerguelen isolates, the same additional information is provided as in Fig. 3. The tree was reconstructed by neighbor-joining using the p-distance model and was bootstrapped with 1,000 replications. Numbers at nodes indicate bootstrap values higher than 70%. The scale bar represents 0.5% nucleotide divergence."
