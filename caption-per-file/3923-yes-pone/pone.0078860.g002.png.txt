Phylogenetic relationship of Arabidopsis and Vitis ABCA (ATH) proteins.The amino acid sequences of all Arabidopsis ABCA (ATH) proteins and those of Vitis vinifera were aligned using the MUSCLE program and subjected to phylogenetic analysis by the distance with neighborjoining method using MEGA5 programme. Accession numbers for Arabidopsis sequences are AtABCA2 (NP_190357.2), AtABCA3 (NP_190358.2), AtABCA4 (NP_190359.4), AtABCA5 (NP_190360.2), AtABCA6 (NP_190361.2), AtABCA7 (NP_190362.2), AtABCA8 (NP_190363.3), AtABCA9 (NP_200981.1), AtABCA10 (NP_200982.1), AtABCA11 (NP_200977.1) and AtABCA12 (NP_200978.1). AtSKD1 (AEC08019.1) and VvSKD1 (XP_002266534.1) were used as outgroups."
