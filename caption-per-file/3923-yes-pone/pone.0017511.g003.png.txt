Bayesian phylogenetic tree of Littorina saxatilis mitochondrial cytochrome-b haplotypes with coalescence times estimated in BEAST. Littorina fabalis is included as the outgroup for the tree. Numbers above the nodes refer to posterior probabilities of the clades (probabilities 0.7 (Aâ€“E, A1, A2) are indicated by different colours (see Fig. 4 for their frequencies in different populations demonstrated as pie charts). Mean TMRCAs for these clades in ka are given below the nodes, together with the two utilized calibration points: fossils (*) and allozyme divergence (**). Sequence accession numbers are provided in Table S3."
