"pone.0051838.g002.png","Phylogenetic analysis of oak AQP proteins.Phylogenic tree showing the four clusters PIP1, PIP2, TIP1 and TIP2. The nine Quercus petraea AQPs are compared with all the PIPs as well as all the TIP1s and TIP2s from Arabidopsis thaliana and Populus trichocarpa. Maximum likehood phylogenetic analysis and bootstrap test were performed using MEGA 5. Identified subgroups are indicated by different colors and oak AQP names are marked by full circles. Branch lengths are proportional to evolutionary distance."
