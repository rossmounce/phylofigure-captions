"pone.0086903.g003.png","Phylogenetic tree derived from 3D structural alignments.The phylogenetic tree is based on the analysis of the closest 500 matches resulting from a search of the protein structure database using the structure of RAGE Ig domains V-C1 as a query. After filtering the results for a minimum length of alignment and removal of duplicates 27 different proteins were retrieved. Twenty four out of these 27 are cell adhesion molecules, only 2 belong to the T-cell receptor family and one protein represents the light chain of an antibody. RAGE V-C1 Ig domains group very closely with cell adhesion molecules BCAM and CD80. OCAM (olfactory cell adhesion molecule; pdb code 2jll); CEACAM-1 (Carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 1, CD 66a; pdb code 3R4D); PD-L1 (programmed death1 inhibitory receptor; pdb code 3BIS); CD80 (cluster of differentiation 80; pdb code 1DR9); RAGE (receptor for advanced glycation endproducts; pdb code 3CJJ); BCAM (Lutheran glycoprotein; basal cell adhesion molecule; pdb code 2PET); NECTIN-1 (pdb code 4FMF); NECTIN-2 (pdb code 4FMK); NECTIN-4 (pdb code 4FRW); CD155 (cluster of differentiation 155, poliovirus receptor; pdb code 3URO); CD2 (cluster of differentiation 2; pdb code 1HNG); MADCAM-1 (mucosal vascular addressin cell adhesion molecule 1; pdb code 1GSM); VCAM (vascular cell adhesion molecule; pdb code 1VSC); ICAM-1 (intercellular adhesion protein 1, pdb code 1IC1); ICAM-2 (intercellular adhesion protein 2; pdb code 1ZXQ); TCR-alpha (T-cell receptor a chain; pdb code 1NFD); TCR-gamma (T-cell receptor g chain; pdb code 1HXM); Fab-LC (antibody Fab fragment light chain; pdb code 3QNX); Neuroplastin (pdb code 2WV3); MUSK (pdb code 2IEP); NCAM-Ig-1–2 (neural cell adhesion molecule Ig domains 1 and 2; pdb code 1EPF); NCAM-Ig-2–3 (neural cell adhesion molecule Ig domains 1 and 2; pdb code 1QZ1); DSCAM (Down syndrom cell adhesion molecule; pdb code 3DMK); Hemolin (pdb code 1BIH); ROBO (Roundabout; pdb code 2VRA); ROBO-1 (Roundabout homolog 1; pdb code 2V9R); Contactin (protein tyrosine phosphatase z (PTPRZ); pdb code 3JXA); TAG-1 (axonin, pdb code 1CS6)."
