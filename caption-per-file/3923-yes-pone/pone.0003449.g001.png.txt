"pone.0003449.g001.png","Phylogenetic analysis and dendrogram comparing the amino acid sequences of several catalase-peroxidases from the Ascomycota class and catalases used to construct the M antigen model (shown in bold).Swiss-Prot (sp) accession numbers for each sequence are shown on the right. Alignment of 26 catalase sequences was done using CLUSTAL W. The sequences were subjected to phylogenetic analysis using neighbour-join with maximum parsimony and minimum evolution, and length of the lines and distance between the clusters determined. The numbers on the branches are bootstrap values obtained with 500 replicates and indicate the frequency that all species to the right appear as a monophyletic cluster."
