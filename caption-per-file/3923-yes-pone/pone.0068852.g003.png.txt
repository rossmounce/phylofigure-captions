"pone.0068852.g003.png","Phylogenetic analysis based on the 16S rRNA V6 region sequences from samples of the susceptible strain (SS), chlorpyrifos-resistant lines (CRL) and fipronil-resistant lines (FRL).The bootstrap value (100 replicates) associated with the taxa clustered in the tree is shown next to the branches. The scaled bar represents 0.1% estimated phylogenetic divergence. The numbers below SS, FRL and CRL are the percent abundances corresponding to the OTUs on the tree, and the numbers in the square brackets are the percentage abundances corresponding to the phylum in SS, FRL and CRL."
