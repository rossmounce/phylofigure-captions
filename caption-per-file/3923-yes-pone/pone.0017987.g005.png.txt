Comparison of phylogenetic relationships based on microarray data and multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) data. Dendrogram on the left was based on microarray data for the presence and absence of genes using UPGMA while phylogenic tree on the right in mirrored image was based on the concatenated sequences of 7 MLST alleles constructed using the neighbour joining method. The branches showing similar groupings were connected by lines. MLST based tree was rooted using a Streptococcus pneumonia strain marked as SP as an outgroup. Microarray data based tree was unrooted."
