Evolutionary relationships of taxa Zona Occluden Toxin (ZOT).The evolutionary history was inferred using the Neighbor-Joining method. The percentage of replicate trees in which the associated taxa clustered together in the bootstrap test (1000 replicates) is shown next to the branches. The tree is drawn to scale, with branch lengths in the same units as those of the evolutionary distances used to infer the phylogenetic tree. DSMZ 1 and DSMZ 2 correspond to the ZOT paralogs in C. ureolyticus DSM20703. ACS-301-V-Sch-3b:C. ureolyticus ACS-301-V-Sch-3b."
