"pone.0020484.g003.png","Bacteroidetes and Chlorobi RNaseP A stem R length mapped on rRNA phylogenetic tree. A) rRNA phylogenetic tree for Bacteroidetes and Chlorobi for the sequences of RNaseP A under study; RNaseP A stem R values mapped onto the rRNA tree; other legend are similar as figure 2A. B) The RNaseP A sequences including the hypothetical ancestral sequence (at the top generated by Dnapars) for the species present on the rRNA tree in the figure 3A are shown here. The ‘?’ indicates that the ancestral base is not certain at that position; other alphabet notation follows the standard IUPAC nucleotide code."
