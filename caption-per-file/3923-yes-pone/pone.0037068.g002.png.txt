"pone.0037068.g002.png","A) M. natalensis populations clustering based on Structure Bayesian inference (K = 2 to 4); Burn-in period = 150,000; MCMC repeat length = 200,000).Each color represents one assumed population cluster K. Multiple colored bars display an individual's estimated membership proportion in more than one population (q), i.e. the admixture level. The labels correspond to the sampling location indicated in table S1. It should be noted that PCR-positive and PCR-negative rats collected in a same location belong to the same source population according to structure. B) Neighbor-joining (NJ) phenogram summarizing Cavalli-Sforza & Edwards' (1967) DCE chord distances among 15 populations of M. natalensis collected in Guinea. Values on the nodes represent the percentage of bootstrap replicates over individuals (n = 100). Branch lengths are proportional to the genetic distance between the different populations and the scale bar represents a distance DCE of 0.05. Population codes are defined according to Table S1. C) The same phylogenetic reconstruction as shown in (B) but with a partition of the LASV positive and negative rats into sub-populations. The Bamakama sample was used as an out-group."
