"pone.0036464.g003.png","Cophylogenetic reconstruction of the history of mimicry between country level populations of H. erato and H. melpomene.Example cophylogenetic history of the mimicry relationship between H. erato and H. melpomene based on MDC phylogenetic estimates (shown in Figure 2), and reconstructed using TreeMap 3. Bars indicate 95% Bayesian confidence intervals for divergence times, corresponding to Figure S1. Grey-filled dots correspond to reconstructed codivergence events; white-filled dots represent duplication events which, in this case, are both followed by model switch events â€“ one for the colonisation of H. erato etylus in East Ecuador by H. melpomene ecuadoriensis, here the sister to H. melpomene malleti (also from East Ecuador), the other for the colonisation of the H. erato hydara population from Trinidad by a population of H. melpomene melpomene, here the sister of a lineage from French Guiana (one of the sampled mainland countries closest to Trinidad); the only mimicry loss event is indicated at the most recent common ancestor of H. erato hydara populations from Trinidad and Panama. Taxon labels correspond to those in Figure 2."
