Multiple alignments (top) and phylogenetic analyses (bottom) of the 337 bp TaPMR5 gene sequence with similar cDNA or EST sequences in wheat, barley, rice, maize, sorghum, B. distachyon, a species of fescue (Festuca arundinacea) and an interspecific hybrid of two wild rye species (Leymus cinereus x Leymus triticoides). This region has 90.3% identity in these cereal plants. A. thaliana PMR5 gene and its Chinese cabbage orthologue were used as control outgroups. Nucleotides with white lettering in black boxes are 100% conserved, turquoise shading with white lettering indicates 75% or greater conservation, and unshaded nucleotides with black letters are less than 75% conserved. A phylogenetic tree of the PMR5 gene fragments from different species was obtained by analysis with DNAMAN software (Version 5.2.10, Lynnon corporation, Quebec, Canada). Ta  =  Triticum aestivum (GenBank accession: CV759357); Le  =  Leymus cinereus x Leymus triticoides (EG378784); Bd  =  B. distachyon (ADDN01000398); Fa  =  Festuca arundinacea (DT707549); Os  =  Oryza sativa (NM_001056332); Zm  =  Zea mays (NM_001148816); Sb  =  Sorghum bicolor (XM_002467995); Hv  =  H. vulgare (BE413258); Br  =  Brassica rapa subsp. Pekinensis (EX125594); At  =  A. thaliana (AK117382)."
