The maximum likelihood tree of FslK members.The phylogenetic tree was built with the kinase domain sequences using PhyML 3.1 and was drawn using Interactive Tree Of Life Version 2.2.2 (http://itol.embl.de/#). The p-values of approximate likelihood ratios (SH-aLRT) plotted as circle marks on the branches (only p-values>0.5 are indicated) and circle size is proportional to the p-values. Filled red circles mark sequences used in the Figure 2. For abbreviations see Table S1."
