"pone.0065347.g006.png","Relationship between microcosm conditions and bacterial phylotypes (phylum level).(A) Heatmap with double clustering. The microcosm conditions are clustered at the top and bacterial phylotypes are clustered on the left of the heatmap according to their intensity profile similarity. Black corresponds to a higher abundance and white to an absence of taxa. (B) Relative abundance (%) of phylogenetic groups in 16S rRNA libraries from the four incubation conditions at 270 days."
