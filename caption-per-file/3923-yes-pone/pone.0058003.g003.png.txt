Phylogenetic relationships between the XB3-like genes.(A) The phylogenetic tree of the plant XB3-like proteins. The amino acid sequences of the plant XB3 proteins were aligned using MUSCLE, and the phylogenetic tree was constructed using the neighbour-joining method in the MEGA 5 software. Each node has a number that indicates the bootstrap value for 1000 replicates. The scale bar represents 0.1 substitutions per sequence position. (B) Multiple sequence alignment of representative RING domains. Dashes denote the gaps introduced to maximise the alignment, asterisks indicate conserved residues and the black dots indicate residues conserved in all RING types."
