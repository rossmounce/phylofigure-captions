"pone.0019308.g005.png","Subfamily distribution of karyopherin-βs across the Eukaryota. Black circles indicate presence of a phylogenetically supported (see methods) KAP-β subfamily member. Grey circles indicate candidate subfamily members that could not be verified phylogenetically. Empty circles indicate no candidate found. Numbered circles indicate cases where more than one candidate is found. A small circle indicates candidate(s) in addition to phylogenetically supported candidate(s) indicated by big circles. The left panel illustrates the phylogenetic relationships between subfamilies. See Table S1 for additional information including protein identifiers."
