"pone.0024430.g003.png","Comparison of host and endosymbiont phylogeny in Psychotria. The Psychotria host (left) and Burkholderia (right) phylograms were constructed from plastid ndhF-rpl32, petD, petL-psbE, psbD-trnT, rps16, rps16-trnK, trnG, trnL-rpl32 and trnLF DNA and bacterial 16S rRNA, recA and gyrB regions, respectively. Bayesian posterior probabilities and Maximum Likelihood bootstrap values are shown above branches. Dashed lines indicate strict co-speciation between host plants and their endosymbionts. Branch lengths represent the number of substitution per site."
