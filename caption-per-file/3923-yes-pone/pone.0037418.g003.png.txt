"pone.0037418.g003.png","Ultrametric tree showing phylogenetic relationships among Asian colobines as obtained from mitochondrial (A) and nuclear sequence data (B).Open circles indicate ML bootstrap values of 100% and posterior probabilities of 1.0; values below are given at respective branches. Blue bars represent 95% highest posterior densities of divergence ages. In A, upper and lower numbers on branches indicate ML bootstrap values and posterior probabilities as derived from datasets mtDNA1 and mtDNA2, respectively. Abbreviations used in the bars: L = late, E = early, and M = middle."
