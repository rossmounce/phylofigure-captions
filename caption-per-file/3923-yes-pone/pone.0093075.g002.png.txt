Bayesian inference and maximum-likelihood phylogenies.The species Paramegophrys oshanensis and Megophrys nasuta were included as outgroup. Numbers above or below branches are bootstrap values based on 1000 replicates for maximum-likelihood analyses (left, >50 retained) and Bayesian posterior probabilities (right, >0.5 retained). Vouchers and Genbank accessions are provided corresponding to information in Table 1. Abbreviations: FJ = Fujian; GD = Guangdong, HK = Hong Kong; HN = Hunan; JX = Jiangxi; SC = Sichuan."
