"pone.0048764.g001.png","Sequence of the apUII precursor and its comparison to known homologous sequences from vertebrates.(A) Consensus cDNA (plain font), translated protein sequence (bold font). Right: open reading frame map (full vertical line, stop codon; half line, met, beginning of protein) shows three reading schemes: 1. as read shown at left, 2. shift right by 1 nucleic acid, 3. shift right by 2 nucleic acids. The map shows Scheme 1 is the most appropriate reading scheme. (B) A comparison between known UII precursor sequences from different species; for human, mouse and rat, urotensin-2B prohormone sequences (Q76510, Q76511, Q76512, respectively) were included in the alignment in addition to UII sequences For carp, two sequences found in UniProtKB and differing by a few single amino acid substitutions were also included. Protein accession numbers are shown at left. The BLOSUM62 identity scoring is shaded; the lighter shade represents an identity of >50%, darker shade is 100%. Symbols: ?*? indicates fully conserved amino acid positions, ?:? and ?.? indicate strong (>0.5) and weak (?0.5) positively scoring groups that occur in the Gonnet Pam250 matrix. (C) Sequence alignment of apUII and contulakins from the lettered cone snail shows similarity highlighted by the BLOSUM62 method. (D) the urotensin II precursor phylogenetic tree calculated by the neighbor-joining method from the multiple sequence alignment."
