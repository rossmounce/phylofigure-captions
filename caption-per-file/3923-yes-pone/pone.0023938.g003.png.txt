Phylogeny of partial 16S rRNA gene sequences from cyanobacteria isolated from Bahamian ascidians. Sequences obtained in this study are highlighted (bold lettering). Labels on terminal nodes of reference sequences indicate other cyanobacteria species and GenBank accession numbers. Labels on terminal nodes of sequences from this study include sample name, clone sequenced (in parenthesis), and sample code for the Lissoclinum species (underlined: LSS: Little San Salvador; WPC: West Plana Cay, and EPC: East Plana Cay). Tree topology was obtained from neighbor-joining (NJ) analysis. Individual bootstrap values from NJ, maximum parsimony (MP) and maximum likelihood (ML) analyses and posterior probabilities (PP) from Bayesian inference are located in the upper-left box and correspond to circle numbers on tree nodes. Solid lines indicate bootstrap support greater than 50% from at least 2 of the 4 phylogenetic criteria, and dashed lines indicate weakly supported branches. Bars and labels highlight the 11 major cyanobacterial groups detected in this study (A to K). Samples corresponding to Lissoclinum aff. fragile and L. fragile are further highlighted with a grey bar (IIA and IIB, respectively). The Prochloron spp. clade includes GenBank sequences: DQ357949, -50, -53, -57, -62, -66, -67, DQ385852, and X63141. The sponge symbiont clade includes GenBank sequences: AY701287, -1288, -1290, -1296, -1299, -1301, -1302, -1304, -1306, -1311, EU307448, -455, -458, -477, -488, -489, -492, -509, EF121775, -89, -98. Scale bar represents 0.02 substitutions per site."
