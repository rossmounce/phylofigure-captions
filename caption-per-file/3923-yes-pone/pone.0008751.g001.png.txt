Maximum likelihood phylogeny of the concatenated analysis obtained with the PhyML software.A separation between sequences from the outbreak (red branches, n = 55) and those from other sequences can be observed in the shaded area to the right of the figure. Genotypes 1b (references sequences, n = 232) are represented by orange branches and the genotypes No-1b are represented by black branches (n = 34). A close up of the Wheelwright sequences are detailed on the left of the figure, with PhyML bootstrap support for the clade at 85%. Branch lengths reflect the likelihood distances."
