The C. elegans genome encodes 3 SMF transporters orthologous to the plant, fungi and animal DMT protein family.(A) Unrooted phylogenetic tree of a subset of eukaryotic members of the DMT family of transporters. C. elegans SMF proteins are more closely related to the animal than to the fungus or plant orthologues. (B) Multiple alignment of animal DMT1 orthologues. The 12-transmembrane domain topology of vertebrate DMT1 is conserved in C. elegans SMF proteins (black boxes), as well as the consensus transport sequence (red box). Dotted arrows indicate regions of the proteins affected by the deletion alleles eh5, gk113, and ok1035 of smf-1, 2, and 3 respectively. Amino acids with similar biochemical properties are highlighted with the same color. * represent residues conserved in all aligned sequences, : corresponds to highly conserved residues and. to less conserved residues."
