"pone.0064194.g003.png","Phylogenetic analysis of Grapevine redleaf-associated virus (GRLaV).The neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree was constructed using full-length genomes of GRLaV and members of approved genera in the family Geminiviridae. The consensus tree on the left was drawn to scale with bootstrap values (1,000 replicates) shown at the nodes. Branches with less than 70% bootstrap support have been collapsed. The genome organization of GRLaV and representative members of approved genera in the family Geminiviridae is shown on the right. Position and orientation of individual ORFs is indicated by arrows with clockwise direction representing virion sense and anticlockwise direction representing complementary sense. The coat protein (CP) and replication-associated protein (Rep) are shown in blue and red color, respectively. Intergenic regions are represented as grey boxes. The location of the putative stem-loop (hairpin) structure at the origin of virion strand replication within the large intergenic region is indicated in black at the 12 O?clock position. Genome maps were drawn using guidelines described in ICTV taxonomy proposal 2012.018a-p to P2012.018pP."
