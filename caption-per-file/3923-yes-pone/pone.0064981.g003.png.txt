"pone.0064981.g003.png","Nuclear DNA contents and evolutionary relationships among members of the section Thea[31].The phylogenetic tree of the section Thea was constructed by using UPGMA and Nei and Li's similarity coefficient from pairwise comparisons between the 22 species and varieties based on RAPD markers [44]. The estimated 2C-values for each species are shown on the right of species, while the 1C DNA amount (pg) which also equals the genome size is shown by ?."
