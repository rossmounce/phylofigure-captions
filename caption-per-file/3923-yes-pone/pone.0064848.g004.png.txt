Unrooted phylogenetic tree based on bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequences (ca.1,400bp) of sponge X.testudinaria using Neighbour-joining method.The scale bar represents 0.05 substitutions per nucleotide position. Bootstrap values (1,000 replicates) higher than 50% are shown. The number in brackets shows the number of sequences in each OTU. ?mark means sequences from sponge X. testudinaria."
