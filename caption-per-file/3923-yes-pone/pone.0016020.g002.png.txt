"pone.0016020.g002.png","Phylogenetic network based on SNPs charaterized in the entire collection of 305 Beijing isolates. This phylogenetic network was constructed using the median-joining algorithm with the set of SNPs identified in the 3R genes analyzed on the final collection of 305 Beijing isolates. Isolates are color coded according to their geographic origin. M. tuberculosis strains Myc1 (H37Rv) and Myc2 are included as non-Beijing strains. The numbers in each branch correspond to SNPs (Table 1) that enabled discrimination of SNP types. Node sizes are proportional to the number of isolates belonging to the same SNP type: Bmyc1 node (2); Bmyc2 node (14); Bmyc4 node (13); Bmyc6 node (7); Bmyc25 node (28); Bmyc26 node (13); Bmyc12 node (3); Bmyc13 node (13); Bmyc16 node (7); Bmyc19 node (2); Bmyc10 node (188). See Table S1 for details about strains belonging to each node. Mv represents a median vector created by the software and can be interpreted as possibly extant unsampled sequences or extinct ancestral sequences. The relative proportion of isolates in each node, of a given geographic origin, may not reflect the population structure of the Beijing family of that geographic region."
