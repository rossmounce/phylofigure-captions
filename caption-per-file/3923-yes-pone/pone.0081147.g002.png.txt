Unrooted phylogenetic tree of all candidate Snf2 genes in plant genomes.The full tree from which this subset was extracted is presented in Figure S3. The subfamily branches were collapsed to a single node that represents the first split that is part of the subfamily branch. Confidence values (50-100) are indicated at the relevant splits of the branches. The tree is based on 100 bootstrap replicates. The leaf tagged ‘not classified’ indicates candidate Snf2 members that are not part of a known subfamily, including Cre09.g390000.t1.1 (Chlamydomonas reinhardtii) and members of sequence databases."
