"pone.0030187.g002.png","UPGMA phylogenetic tree of the concatenated 100 gene sequence (106,818 bp). The results are based on a pair-wise analysis of the concatenated 100 gene nucleotide sequence for each of the 21 E. faecium strains using the Poisson correction method in MEGA4.0.2 software. An UPGMA tree was constructed depicting the evolutionary distance between these sequences. The tree is drawn to scale with the branch lengths representing the evolutionary distances, the scale can be seen at the bottom of the tree."
