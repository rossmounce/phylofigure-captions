Phylogenetic analysis of XerC, XerD, XerH and XerS recombinases.XerH from the ε subgroup species (listed in Table 2) were compared with XerD and XerC recombinases from other ε species and representative bacteria from the α, β, δ and γ taxa (Table 1). XerS recombinases of S. pyogenes M1 GAS and L. lactis Il1403 [23] were added for comparison. Amino acid sequence alignment (with Clustal W) and phylogenetic analyses were performed in MEGA4 [60]. The phylogeny was built using the Neighbor-Joining method [61]. The tree is drawn to scale, with branch lengths in the same units as those of the evolutionary distances used to infer the phylogenetic tree. The evolutionary distances were computed using the Poisson correction method and are in the units of the number of amino acid substitutions per site. The size range of the recombinases (in amino acids) is indicated under the recombinase name, in brackets."
