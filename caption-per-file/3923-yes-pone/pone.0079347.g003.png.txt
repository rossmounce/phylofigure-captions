P. ramorum RXLR effector gene families exhibiting strong evidence of recombination.Changing evolutionary relationships in different regions of genes illustrate recombination among paralogs. Maximum likelihood trees were constructed for gene fragments on either side of estimated recombination breakpoints inferred using RDP. Bootstrap support for branches is out of 100 samples. The branch lengths are drawn to scale and measured in the number of substitutions per site. A. The phylogenetic relationships among genes in this gene family change between the N- and C-terminal coding regions of the gene. The recombination breakpoint is in the DEER motif. B. Recombination in the C-terminal functional region. PrAvh379 has a frameshift mutation leading to a 507 bp truncated gene and thus is not included in the second tree."
