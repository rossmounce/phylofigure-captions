"pone.0088834.g002.png","Comparison of the residual variation seen in maximum absolute growth rates of different vertebrate taxa.Taxa are ordered according to their phylogenetic relatedness. Presented are whisker-plots with means. The whiskers extend to the most extreme data point which is not more than 1.5 times (default value in R) the interquartile range given by the box. Open circles are outliers. Solid continuous lines represent the value of the intercept of the different amniotic groups (grey = altricial birds; black = precocial birds; red = mammals (eutherians+marsupials); green = reptiles; orange = dinosaurs). For values of the intercepts see Table 2."
