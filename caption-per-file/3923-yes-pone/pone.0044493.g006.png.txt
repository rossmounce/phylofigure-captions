Physical interaction of PDIL1-1 with OsCP1.(A) Phylogenetic tree of Arabidopsis cysteine protease 43 (AtCP43) amino acid sequences with its rice homologs. The sequences of the proteins were aligned using the CLUSTALW2 software program and a phylogenetic tree was generated using the MEGA5 software program. B) Map of conserved domains of OsCP1. The three conserved domains, inhibitor_I29, peptidase_C1A, and granulin, are indicated by boxes. (C) Partial OsCP1 cDNA encoding peptidase_C1A and granulin, and full-length PDIL1-1 cDNA were fused to sequences encoding the Gal4 activation domain (AD) and the Gal4 DNA-binding domain (BD) in pGADT7 and pGBKT7, respectively. Each number indicates yeast cells transformed with a combination of only pGADT7 or pGBKT7 vectors or recombinant plasmids. Combinations are described in the box. Transformants were plated onto minimal medium (Leu−/Trp−) and (Leu−/Trp/His− (5 mM 3-AT)), incubated for 4 days, and then photographed. (D) Expression analysis of OsCP1 and its homologs. Transcript levels of OsCP1 and its homologs, Os05g0108600 and Os01g0971400, were examined by real-time RT-PCR with gene-specific primers. These experiments were repeated three times independently. The reported values of transcript levels of OsCP1 homologs are normalized to numerical values relative to the transcript level of OsCP1 in DAF5, which is set at a value of 1.00±0.00.
