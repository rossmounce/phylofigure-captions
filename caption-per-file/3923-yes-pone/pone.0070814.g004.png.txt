A) Maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree of the envelope gene of the virus inoculum.The scale bar represents one nucleotide substitution. B) Frequency of each inoculum variant at the amino acid level. The number of each viral genome present within the inoculum was estimated based on the amino acid sequence (black bars) and at the nucleotide level (grey bars)."
