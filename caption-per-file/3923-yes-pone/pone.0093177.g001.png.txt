"pone.0093177.g001.png","Conservation and genetic organisation of the E. coli f9 fimbrial operon in an evolutionary context.Left: The phylogeny of 42 E. coli strains is displayed as inferred by the Neighbour-Joining method on the concatenated nucleotide sequence of 7 housekeeping genes (9,015 nt over an equal number of positions). E. coli strains are colour-coded according to phylogroup (A, B1, B2, D and E). The scale on the phylogenetic tree represents the number of nucleotide substitutions per site. Closely related strains with identical f9 genetic context are collapsed and included E. coli K-12 (n = 3; strains MG1655, DH10β, BW2952), E. coli B (n = 2; strains BL21(DE3), B REL606), E. coli O55 (n = 2; strains CB9615, RM12579), E. coli O157 (n = 5; strains EDL933, Sakai, EC4115, TW14359, Xuzhou21). Right: Alignment of the f9 genes (blue) and their flanking genes. The f9 operon is flanked 3′ by the highly conserved ydeP gene (grey) and 5′ by the hipBA operon (red). The direct 5′ region of the f9 operon is variable, and involves three distinct hypothetical transcriptional regulators (green, purple, and lilac). The percentage DNA sequence identity is indicated in grey. The scale on the aligned genetic context represents DNA length in kilobase pair."
