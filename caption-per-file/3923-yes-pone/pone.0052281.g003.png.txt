"pone.0052281.g003.png","Phylogenetic tree constructed of the first 517 unique base pairs of all patient samples.The sequences published by Pettersson and colleagues (Hcc, Hca Tva and Tvb) and the sequences of the known type strains. The ?B. hominis? group clearly differs phylogenetically from the known type strains and falls within the group described by Pettersson. Note that two patients (#6-II and #57)) are missing from this tree, since it proved to be impossible to sequence the middle part of the first 517bp of the 16S rDNA. Borrelia burgdorferi (ATCC 35210) was used as out-species."
