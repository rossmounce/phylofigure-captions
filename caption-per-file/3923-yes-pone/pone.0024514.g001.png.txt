"pone.0024514.g001.png","Phylogenetic analysis of the genotype-2b polyprotein sequences. In order to perform the phylogenetic analysis, we first aligned all 60 HCV complete ORF amino acid sequences obtained from the patients along with reference sequences (2b.HC-J8.D10988, 2.JP.MD2b9-2, and 2a.JP.JFH-1.AB047639), using the ClustalW program, and constructed the phylogenetic tree using the Neighbor-Joining method with MEGA version 4 software. Blue circles indicate SVR patients and red circles indicate non-SVR patients."
