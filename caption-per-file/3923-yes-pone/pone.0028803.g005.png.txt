Neighbour-joining tree of 16SRNA gene sequences depicting the phylogenetic relationships of clones from the natural PBRP sample. The scale bars represent a 2% sequence divergence and percentages of 1000 bootstrap resamplings are shown at the nodes. Species names and OTUs' numbers are followed by their GenBank accession numbers their proportion in all clones of the library, respectively."
