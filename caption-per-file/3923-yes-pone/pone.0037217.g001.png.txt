Soybean has eleven homologs of yeast ATG8.A, Phylogenetic tree of ATG8s in Glycine max (Gm), Arabidopsis thaliana (At), Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Sc), Selaginella moellendorffii (Sm), Physcomitrella patens (Pp), Ostreococcus lucimarinus (Ol), Oryza sativa (Os) and Zea mays (Zm). Deduced amino acid sequences were aligned by CLUSTALX and the phylogenetic tree was generated by the neighbour-joining method and displayed using MEGA5. GmATG8s were underlined. B, Deduced amino acid sequences of GmATG8c and alignment with ScATG8. Closed arrowhead indicates the C-terminal Glycine residue which is processed by Atg4 cysteine protease. C, Fold Changes of the transcript levels of soybean ATG8s in the primary leaves after nitrogen starvation. The average expression levels for the three biological replicates are shown. Significant differences between N and –N for 3 days or 6 days, and between –N for 3 days and 6 days are labeled. All significant levels were calculated by t-test. *, significant (p"
