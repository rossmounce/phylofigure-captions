Phylogeny of group II intron ORF classes lacking a recognizable D/En region.(A) Phylogenetic tree based on the alignment of the X-domain and its C-terminal extension. (B) Phylogenetic tree based on the alignment of the RT-domain (0?7). Consensus unrooted trees estimated by ML methods are presented as a radial phylogram. The phylogenetic ORF classes are indicated and the rate of amino-acid substitutions per site is shown at the bottom of each tree. The branches of the major classes are also color-coded to improve visualization of the major clades. Bootstrap results (?75%) are given for each node (PhyML). Posterior probability values (?0.96) for Bayesian analysis of the major phylogenetic ORF classes are also indicated in italics. Introns previously classified as phylogenetic ORF class F are indicated by an asterisk."
