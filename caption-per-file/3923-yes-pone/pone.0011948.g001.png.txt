Phylogenetic analysis of GBoV1. (A) Full length structural protein (VP1/2) sequences of all HBoV and animal bocavirus strains available in GenBank were used to determine phylogeny of GBoV1 by neighbor-joining analysis of pairwise distances between translated amino acid sequences. Bootstrap re-sampling was used to determine robustness of individual clades (values above 70% shown above the branches). (B) The 4 major open reading frames of GBoV1 were analyzed using maximum likelihood composition analysis method (MEGA4.1) comparing pairwise distances of translated sequences of representative variants (reference sequence) of all four HBoV species. Accession numbers of sequences used precedes the name of corresponding bocavirus species."
