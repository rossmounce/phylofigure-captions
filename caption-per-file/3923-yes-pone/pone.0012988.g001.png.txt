Core gene phylogeny and MLSA allelic profiles compared to CRISPR spacer types.(A) A Maximum Parsimony phylogeny of a concatenated nucleotide alignment of 12 loci (6684 bp) from 39 S. islandicus isolates from a single hot spring in Mutnovsky. Scale bar represents eight nucleotide changes. Numbers above branches represent bootstrap support from 1000 replicates. The large group of strains with nearly identical MLSA sequences at core gene loci is highlighted in blue. (B) The allelic profiles of MLSA loci show the number of SNPs in comparison to strain M.16.19, and the background color in each cell indicates the allele type for each locus. (C) The three colored summary bars to the right of the allelic profiles indicate ancestral groupings of each CRISPR locus by shared spacers as in Figure 2. ‘X’ indicates a CRISPR locus is not present and ‘NA’ indicates that a locus could not be sequenced."
