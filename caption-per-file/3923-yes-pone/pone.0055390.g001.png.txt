"pone.0055390.g001.png","Repetitive DNA sequences and ankyrin repeat domain number polymorphism.The example of WD0294. A) Only the ankyrin repeat domain containing regions are shown. Blue rectangles represent individual ankyrin repeat domains. The light gray shading between the ANK clusters indicates homologies between the different strains. Double arrows represent identical duplications. Small black arrows indicate direct repeats capable of engaging into illegitimate recombination. B) Detail of the nucleotide alignment around the deleted region. This region includes the ANK domains 3?8 from wHa, 3?6 from wMel and 3?4 from wAu. Gray rectangles show the position of repeated sites flanging the deletions. ANK repeats are underlined. C) ML phylogenetic relationships between individual ankyrin repeat domains."
