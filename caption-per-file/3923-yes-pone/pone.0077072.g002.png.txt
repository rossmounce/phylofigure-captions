"pone.0077072.g002.png","Phylogenetic tree generated with sequences of 425 bp fragments of the SFV pol-in from blood and saliva of SFV-infected hunters BAK132, BAK177, BAD456 and LOBAK2 and different gorillasSequences from hunters BAK132 (A), BAK177 (B), BAD456 (C) and LOBAK2 (D) are indicated in red (saliva clones, ""S"") and blue (PBMC clones, ""P""). Sequences are compared to 8 sequences available in Genbank from different central African NHP gorillas (green). Alignment was performed with the Dambe version 4.5.68 and Clustal W. Phylogenetic analysis was performed with PAUP, version 4.0b10 (Sinauer Associates, Sunderland, MA, USA) based on the Neighbor joining method applying the best model calculated by AIC: HKY (BAK132, BAK177), GTR (BAD456) or TrN (LOBAK2). Bootstrap analysis of 1000 replicates is shown as percentage at nodes. Only values greater than 50% are shown. The scale of the tree is 0.01 nucleotides replacement per site.Of note, phylogenetic tree for BAK132 is representative of trees obtained for the other following hunters (BAK33, BAK74, BAK132, BAD447). Sequences accession numbers for BAK132 SFV clones are KF515432-KF515469. Phylogenetic tree for BAK177 indicates the presence of two distinct groups of SFV clones, suggesting a co-infection with two SFV strains. Sequences accession numbers for BAK177 SFV clones are KC602165 to KC602200. For BAD456 and LOBAK2, some clones displayed G to A mutations (G->A) present in a GG dinucleotide context and absent in the 8 NHP gorillas strains. Sequences accession numbers of SFV clones are KC602201 to KC602238 (BAD456) and KC602129 to KC602164 (LOBAK2).Due to very low viral loads, a single cluster of SFV clones within one compartment (PBMCs or saliva) might derive from PCR amplification of a single SFV copy."
