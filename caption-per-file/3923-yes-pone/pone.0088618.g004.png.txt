"pone.0088618.g004.png","Implications for character evolution in Syndermata.Morphological and biological features of representatives of Syndermata and Gnathostomulida were projected on our phylogenetic tree (see Figs. 2 and 3). Present features are denoted with a plus, absent features are denoted with a minus. The corona in Seisonidea is reduced (denoted with plus/minus). The pictogram of Gnathostomulida has been modified from biodidac.bio.uottawa.ca. Pictograms of other representatives: courtesy of Bernd Baumgart (GÃ¶ttingen, Germany)."
