"pone.0094662.g002.png","Unrooted phylogenetic tree of primary structures of Eurotiomycete proteins related to MstA (AN8737) and MstC (AN6669).The evolutionary history was inferred using the Maximum Likelihood method, and the percentages of replicate trees in which the associated sequences clustered together in the bootstrap test (50 replicates) are shown next to the branches (values below 80% are not included). Branch lengths correspond to the mean number of substitutions per site. Where known, genome locus identities are given; ‘Corr’ indicates that the gene model was corrected; unannotated sequences are given as ‘mstA-like’. The homologues in A. flavus and A. oryzae were found to be encoded by identical genomic DNA sequences (only A. flavus is shown), as expected for organisms that are believed to be variants of the same species [33]. A. nidulans is the only organism represented that possesses two very closely related proteins. MstA (AN8737) and MstC (AN6669) are shown in bold."
