"pone.0049584.g006.png","Strict consensus topology resulting from parsimony analysis of 28 endocranial characters (531 MPTs; L: 68; CI  = 0.54; RI  = 0.75; RCI  = 0.41).Note the lack of overall resolution and that the position of Rynchops niger at the base of Charadriiformes can likely be attributed to the unique endocranial morphology of that taxon in comparison with other charadriiforms. These results suggest that endocranial characters may not be phylogenetically informative among relatively closely related species in a clade."
