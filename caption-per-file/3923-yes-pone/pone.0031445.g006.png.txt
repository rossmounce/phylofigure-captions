"pone.0031445.g006.png","Phylogenetic tree topology comparison-1. The figure provides comparative picture of phylogenetic trees of the functionally quivalent chains of the two adaptor protein complexes namely AP2B (2vglB) and AP1B (1w63B). The phylogenetic trees were constructed using PHYML programme, using maximum likelihood method (as described in Methods section)."
