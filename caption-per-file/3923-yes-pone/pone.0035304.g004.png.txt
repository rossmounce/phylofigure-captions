"pone.0035304.g004.png","A representative phylogenetic tree for the selected Mollicutes species.The tree was constructed by neighbor-joining algorithm using 16 S ribosomal gene sequences from selected species of Mollicutes. The bootstrap values indicate the percentages of 1000 bootstrap replicates that support the branch. Most of the mycoplasmas can be categorized into four phylogenetic groups, namely pneumoniae, hominis, spiroplasma and haemoplasma. The 16 S sequence of M. fermentans M64, JER and PG18 are identical. All human pathogens were underlined. Acholeplasma laidlawii, AYWB phytoplasma and OY phytoplasma were used as the outgroup species in this analysis."
