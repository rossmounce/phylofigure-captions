Maximum likelihood phylogeny of the TIR domain of the TLR family and TLR adaptor molecules shows strong support for individual branches corresponding to vertebrate TLR3, TLR4, TLR5, and invertebrate TLR9.Additionally, the invertebrate TLR9 taxa cluster with vertebrate TLRs outside of the main invertebrate TLR branch. A single cluster contains both vertebrate and invertebrate MyD88, but other TLR adaptor molecules form three groups: TIRAP, SARM; and a single branch for both TRIF and TRAM. The tree is rooted by the outgroup TIR domain Homo sapiens interleukin 1 receptor. The numbers indicate boot-strap support out of 1000. Only values above 500 are indicated."
