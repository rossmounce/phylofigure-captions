Median-joining network analysis of the MLST data obtained for the Indian (sub continent) subsample of L. interrogans.As evident from the trees A and B, a few sequences were highly divergent, possibly because of recombination. The enlargement of the core sequence network (B) revealed four sequences from the Andaman Islands in the central position, suggestive of a possible source of the Indian L. interrogans variability, followed by distinct derived clusters from South India, Central India and Andaman islands. Such a geographic structure is not apparent in the FAFLP network (Figure 1) of the Indian L. interrogans, confirming the reduced phylogenetic resolution of FAFLP in respect to MLST analysis. The color codes have no overlaps with those shown in Figures 1, 2 and 3. The tree/associations were deduced using Network 4.5.0.0 package."
