"pone.0033430.g001.png","Phylogenetic analysis based on the HBV genome and identified recombinant region 1560–2120 bp. Phylograms displaying phylogenetic trees based on (a) complete HBV genome; (c) HBV recombinant region 1560–2120 bp and equivalent fragments immediately preceding; (b) 999–1559 bp and succeeding; (d) 2121–2681 bp this region; with HBV reference sequences from human genotypes (A–H). Relative species and sub-species HBV variants are identified as follows Pan troglodytes troglodytes▴, Pan troglodytes ellioti▾, Pan troglodytes verus▪, Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii♦, Gorilla gorilla○ and Hylobates spp. □, and the host specific cluster is identified by ]. The trees were rooted with the woolly monkey HBV sequence, NC_001896▿. Sequences from this study are in bold and underlined and while recombinant HBV variants have bold branches."
