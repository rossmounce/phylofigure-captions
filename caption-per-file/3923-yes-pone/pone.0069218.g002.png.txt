Maximum clade credibility phylogenies of the HIV-1B populations.Trees for the Central American (A) and The Caribbean (B) HIV-1 sequences are based on a fragment of the pol gene (1,005 nt). Branch tip times reflect the times of viral sampling. The trees are automatically rooted through the use of a relaxed molecular clock, and the total depth of the trees are the TMRCA of the HIV-1B Central American and Caribbean populations. Asterisks indicate nodes with posterior probabilities of >0.80. Branches are colored based on the country state of each node inferred using a discrete geographical model. Vertical back lines in panel B indicate the two mayor sequence clusters: I) Grouping sequences from the Eastern Caribbean islands, Haiti plus half of the Jamaican sequences. II) Grouping sequences from the Western Islands: Cuban, Puerto Rican and Dominican Republic, and half of the Jamaican and The Bahamas sequences."
