Phylogenetic relationships of NP (A), M (B), and NS (C) genes of the BbM viruses and analyzed H9N2 reference viruses. With MEGA, neighbor-joining phylogenetic trees were constructed based on nucleotides 65 to 1398 for NP, 78 to 784 for M, and 54 to 680 for NS genes. Virus abbreviations are listed in the legend of Figure 1. Viruses were highlighted using the same colors and method as Figure 1."
