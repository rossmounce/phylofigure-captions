Bayesian consensus phylogram of HYB sequences from Citrus and related genera.Clades with posterior probabilities (PP) of 0.95?1.00 are marked with bold branches; clades with PP less than 0.95 but at least 0.90 are shown above or to the left of branches. Accessions belonging to Citrus, Poncirus, Fortunella and Microcitrus are indicated by cultivar or common names with details in Table 1. Latin names are used for outgroup genera only. Suffix A and B refer to the two haplotypes. Accessions without a suffix have only one haplotype. The traditional cultivar group to which the accession was previously assigned is indicated by three letter abbreviation following the cultivar/haplotype information. The abbreviations used are: CIT: citron; MAN: mandarin; PUM: pummelo; TRF: trifoliate orange; SWO: sweet orange; KUM: kumquat; SOR: sour orange; PPD: papeda; LIM: lime and lemon. Groups of alleles discussed in the text are marked by cultivar grouping names on the right. Cultivars that indicated an admixture of more than 10% (Table S6) are marked by an asterisk. Scale bar for branch lengths represents substitutions per site."
