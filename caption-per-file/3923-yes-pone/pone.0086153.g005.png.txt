"pone.0086153.g005.png","Phylogenetic Relationship of the Inverted Repeat Sequences.The total length of the inverted repeat (IR) sequences 1 to 8 and their homologous IR sequences located on chromosome 2, 8, 14 and 20 were used to construct the phylogenetic tree. IR sequences 1â€“7 potentially give rise to miRNAs in cotyledons. The time of divergence among the inverted repeats is shown at the tree nodes."
