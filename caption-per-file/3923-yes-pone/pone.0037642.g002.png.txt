Consensus phylogeny estimated using a Bayesian approach that employed the GTR I G model of nucleotide evolution for haplotypes of Phreatomerus latipes.Posterior probability support is listed as a percentage next to the corresponding node. Lists of specimens and haplotypes are listed in Table S1. Colours denote three major clades that match geographic regions shown in Figure 1: Red = ‘Central’, Green = ‘Southern’, Blue = ‘Northern’ and subclades I-IX (boxed) represent phylogenetic structure amongst haplotypes. Bold font represents haplotypes shared between spring complexes (FS1 and BC1). Corresponding haplotype networks for each of the sub-clades are shown and haplotypes with a hatched (Lake Eyre South complex), straight line (Beresford complex) or horizontal line (Billa Kalina complex) patterns differentiate distinct spring complexes from the Coward complex."
