nodA (a) and nodC (b) gene phylogenetic trees of bacterial strains isolated from New Zealand native legumes, selected Mesorhizobium type strains and strains characterised as Mesorhizobium huakuii on the basis of their 16S rRNA sequences.Ca?=?Carmichaelia australis; Cm?=?Carmichaelia monroi; Cn?=?Carmichaelia nana; Co?=?Carmichaelia odorata; Clp?=?Clianthus puniceus; Mn?=?Montigena novae-zelandiae. ? indicates strains focussed on in this study. Numbers on branches are bootstrap % from 500 replicates (shown only when ?50%)."
