"pone.0015635.g004.png","Phylogenetic and structural relationships of beetle-derived GH45 enzymes. A, Bayesian inferred phylogeny of the beetle GH45 enzymes surveyed. Posterior branch probabilities are shown and similar groupings were recovered using both Neighbor-joining and maximum likelihood based algorithms. The enzymes we modelled are indicated by an asterisk. B, Schematic representation of the primary structures of beetle derived beta-1,4-glucanases. An amino acid alignment of the regions surrounding both the proton donor and catalytic nucleophile/base for each sequence is shown underneath the primary structure. Note the distinct clade of beetle GH45s which carry a Glu (green) rather than Asp (red) as a putative proton donor. In contrast, the predicted catalytic nucleophile/base is conserved throughout all sequences surveyed. C, Modelled cartoon view and electrostatic map of S. oryzae Cell-1, which is part of the dominant clade of beetle beta-1,4-glucanases, shown in the same orientation. The catalytic nucleophile/base (Asp23) is shown in white, and the catalytic proton donor (Asp135) is shown in yellow. D, Modelled cartoon view and electrostatic map of G. viridula Cell-1 shown in the same orientation. The catalytic nucleophile/base (Asp24) is shown in white and the catalytic proton donor (Asp136) is shown in yellow. E, Modelled cartoon view and electrostatic map of S. oryzae Cell-3 shown in the same orientation. The catalytic nucleophile/base (Asp29) is shown in white and the catalytic proton donor (Glu146) is shown in magenta. The six conserved disulfide bridges are indicated in cyan."
