Phylogeny of sxtY and sxtZ.ML phylogenetic trees of (a) sxtY (phosphate uptake regulator) and (b) sxtZ (histidine kinase). These represent the class of saxitoxin-related genes of cyanobacterial origin in which taxa most closely related to the STX+ strains are members of the Nostocaceae. ML bootstrap values (when â‰¥50%) are indicated at the nodes. The branch lengths are proportional to the number of substitutions per site (see scales in the figure). Cyanobacterial taxa are shown in blue text, non-cyanobacterial prokaryotes in black text, and eukaryotes (Plantae) in green except for the photosynthetic filose amoeba Paulinella chromatophora in red. The trees have been rooted arbitrarily."
