Time-calibrated phylogeny of Barbourula.Depicted is the MCCT and ML topology with divergence times (in mya) estimated using all five calibration points and standard deviations of 5.0 for their prior distributions. Nodes are at the inferred median heights with gray bars at selected nodes indicating the 95% HPD. Closed circles indicate high Bayesian and ML support (PP = 1.0; BS>90%); open circles indicate high Bayesian support only. Three of the five divergence time calibration points are indicated by crosses; the remaining two are either within Anomocoela or between Anura and Urodela (outgroup Urodela taxa are not shown; see also Figure S1)."
