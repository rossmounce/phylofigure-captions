Distribution of EFG genes in bacteria and evolutionary events associated with EFG subfamilies. The color key for EFG subfamilies is as follows: green for EFG I, blue for spdEFG1, light blue for spdEFG2, and red for EFG II. Large sub-subgroups of EFG II are connected with red lines and are highlighted by white text on black. EFG I copies resulting from recent duplication(s) in β – and γ – proteobacteria are represented by diagonally striped light green boxes. Question marks and two headed arrows in δ–proteobacteria refer to the fact that these EFGs cannot be unambiguously determined as the members of the EFG I or spdEFG2 subfamily. The lateral gene transfer (LGT) of EFG I is represented by light green lines. Pseudogenes are represented by crossed boxes. 16S rRNA aligned sequences were retrieved from RDP II and the species tree was inferred using MrBayes. Solid triangles (in scale) indicated that sequences from more than one organism were used; the number of compressed species is shown in brackets. Exceptions are marked with asterisks: EFG's with large deletions from Leptospira interrogans that were not included in tree computing (*), EFGs that are classified as spdEFG1 by both phylogenetic methods but do not contain the specific insertion (KDG) in switch I (**), frameshift after switch II in Mycobacterium bovis (***). Scale bar shows substitutions per position estimated by MrBayes."
