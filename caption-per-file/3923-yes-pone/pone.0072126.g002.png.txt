Expanded view of the phylogenetic relationships of the genes in the NRT families of P. trichocarpa and A. thaliana.A. subclade NRT1a. B. subclade NRT1b. C. subclade NRT1c. D. subclade NRT1d. E. clade NRT2 and NRT3. A–D represent together clade NRT1/PTR. ClustalX2 was used for the alignment of the amino acids and to calculate the final tree with the neighbor-joining method and a bootstrap value of n = 1,000. The tree was displayed using MEGA 5."
