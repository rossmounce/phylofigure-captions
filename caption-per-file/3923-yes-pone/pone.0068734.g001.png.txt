"pone.0068734.g001.png","Phylogenetic relationship among yeast.A schematic phylogenetic relationship, based on the phylogenetic tree from Kurtzman and Robnett (2003) [16], covering twelve genera of Saccharomycetaceae and all employed species. Note that alternative models to explain the phylogenetic relationship between the Lachancea, Kluyveromyces and Eremothecium genera have been proposed [23] but here we follow the tree in ref. 15. Several evolutionary events, which are relevant for the modern traits, are shown. Note that the relative timing of some events, especially those which left a clear finger-print in the modern genomes (green arrows) is relatively precise, such as WGD [10], the horizontal transfer of a bacterial »anaerobic« DHODase (encoded by URA1) [19], complete rewiring of the respiration related promoters (RGE stands for Rapid Growth Elements) [3], and the loss of respiratory Complex I [9], while the timing of more complex traits (red arrows), such as the capability for anaerobic growth [12], [13] and petite positivity [13], might be less precise."
