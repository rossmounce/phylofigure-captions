"pone.0050882.g002.png","A phylogeny demonstrates that T. pallidum strains infecting baboons in Serengeti National Park and Lake Manyara National Park are genetically distinct from one another.Phylogenies were constructed using both Maximum Parsimony and Maximum Likelihood methods to analyze 25 polymorphisms in six concatenated regions of the Treponema genome. The phylogenies were congruent and a Maximum Parsimony tree was chosen for display, with bootstrap support displayed at all nodes that received greater than 50% using both methods."
