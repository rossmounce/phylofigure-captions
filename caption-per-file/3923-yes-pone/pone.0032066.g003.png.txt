Possible biogeographic scenarios for the three alternative relationships among bythograeid genera. These scenarios take into account the phylogenetic uncertainty in the GAASC clade for the relationships among Cyanagraea, Segonzacia, and (Allograea+Gandalfus+Austinograea). Bars on nodes depict inferred geographic region shifts if ancestor of Bythograeidae was in the Eastern Pacific (EP; white bars) or in the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR; black bars). Alternative equally parsimonious reconstructions exist in some cases, but are not shown for simplicity. Inferred shifts if ancestor was in Western Pacific (WP) or Central Indian Ridge (CIR) are not depicted, but they would require the largest number of shifts in any of the three topologies."
