Number of rrn operons and PCR-TTGE patterns for the 195 Aeromonas strains of the study.Results are presented according to the structure of the population observed in multilocus phylogenetic analysis (MLPA). Unrooted maximum-likelihood tree was based on concatenated sequences of five housekeeping genes (gltA, gyrB, rpoB, tsf and zipA genes), as described in Roger et al. [13]. Only type and references strains are indicated within clades on the tree. The horizontal lines show genetic distance, the scale bar indicating the number of substitutions per nucleotide position. The numbers at the nodes are support values estimated with 100 bootstrap replicates. Only bootstrap values >70 are indicated on the tree. When all members of a clade shared identical features, the common rrn operon number and/or PCR-TTGE pattern was indicated. * The A. caviae clade included the type strain A. caviae CECT 838T displaying an external position to other members of the A. caviae clade in the tree."
