Phylogenetic analysis of amino acid sequences of turkey GSTAs along with chicken GSTAs.Genetic distance of GSTAs among wild (EWtGST: Eastern Wild, RGWtGST: Rio Grande Wild),heritage (RPtGST:Royal Palm) and domestic turkeys (tGST) and chicken alpha-class GST (cGSTA) determined using the neighbor-joining method. Bootstrap supporting values are indicated at each node. The scale bar represents phylogenetic distance (substitution/site). Identical results were obtained when nucleotide sequences were used for alignment and phylogenetic analysis."
