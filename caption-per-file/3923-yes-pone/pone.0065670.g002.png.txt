"pone.0065670.g002.png","Comparative genome analysis of S .pseudopneumoniae IS7493 with the selected closely related streptococci.(s) Whole genome phylogenetic tree of selected VGS isolates (Neighbor joining) generated using CVTree [16]. The branch lengths are representative of phylogenetic distance. Color legend for asterisks: blue, Mitis group; black, Mutans group; purple, Thermophilus group; green, Pyogenic group; and red, Bovis group. (b) Summary statistics for the genome comparison of S. pseudopneumoniae IS7493 with the closely related S. pneumoniae R6 and S.mitis NCTC12261. The CDS that are not accounted for in this comparison coded for hypothetical proteins."
