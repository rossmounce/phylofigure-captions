Phylogenetic tree based on rbcL sequences.Maximum likelihood (ML) phylogeny of the class Ulvophyceae based on 1254 nucleotide positions of the chloroplast-encoded rbcL gene. The phylogram of the entire tree on the upper left is colored to match the inset. Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (class Chlorophyceae) was chosen as the outgroup. Red, rbcL sequences from P. ocellatus. Black, algal rbcL sequences. Bootstrap support (BS) values >50% are provided at the nodes (neighbor-joining/ML). “-“, BS "
