Maximum-likelihood phylogeny of hMPV G genes.A total of 294 partial G gene sequences of hMPV subtypes and sublineages with sampling dates between 1999 and 2009 and of known origin were enrolled. The maximum-likelihood phylogeny was constructed by PAUP* (version 4b10 beta), using a heuristic of Nearest-Neighbor-Interchange (NNI) with 100 bootstrap replicates. The tree is midpoint rooted with a scale bar of 0.1, signifying the genetic distance of nucleotide substitutions per site. For clarity, the background information of each sequence is listed in Table S1."
