"pone.0044187.g003.png","Neighbour-joining phylogenetic tree based on a MUSCLE alignment of ITS2 sequences from Trichuris spp. isolated from human, non-human primates and pigs.Bootstrap values are indicated as percentages on the branches of the consensus tree which was inferred from 1000 replicates [33]. The tree was rooted with T. ovis and T. discolor. The evolutionary distances were computed using the Tajima-Nei method [32] and the scale represents the number of base substitutions per site. Branches corresponding to Clade DG are highlighted in blue, while branches corresponding to the Clades CP-GOB and T. suis are highlighted in green and pink respectively. Clones H5a and H5k, H7b and H7e, H8b and H8c, derived from the worms H5, H7 and H8 [18] which clustered to different clades respectively, are highlighted with red stars."
