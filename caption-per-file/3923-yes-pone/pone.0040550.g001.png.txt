Summary of substrate and host plant use in Hawaiian Drosophila.Phylogenetic relationships of major lineages in Hawaiian Drosophila are shown with substrate type mapped onto the tree (after [28]). Rearing record data (after [32], updated with [77]) are shown in the pie charts. The first column depicts substrate types for each of the main clades (AMC, PNA and modified mouthpart), the second column shows host plant family. While these analyses are not entirely comparable because not all taxa in the phylogeny have rearing data and not all reared species were sampled for the phylogeny, they do show the same trends. First, there is a major shift from bark and stems (black) in the basal lineages to leaves (green) in the AMC and part of the modified mouthparts clades. Taxa using multiple substrate types (e.g., stems and leaves) are shown in red. Second, there is much greater diversity in host plant family usage in the picture wing and modified mouthparts clades owing to the radiation on Araliaceae within the AMC clade. The three host plant families examined in this study are color-coded on the pie charts are follows: Araliaceae (Cheirodendron, green), Campanulaceae (Clermontia, blue), and Nyctagenaceae (Pisonia, orange). Taxa using multiple host plant families are shown in red."
