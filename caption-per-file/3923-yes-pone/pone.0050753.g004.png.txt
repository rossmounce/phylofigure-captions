Presence of oridonin when mapped onto a molecular phylogeny of Isodon.Phylograms represent strict consensus of most parsimonious (MP) trees, using sequence data from the chloroplast (rps16, trnL-trnF; strict consensus of 140 MP trees) and nucleus (ITS; strict consensus of 390 MP trees). Presence of oridonin is indicated by dark colored branches. Taxa reported polymorphic for oridonin production (some populations produce oridonin, others do not) are shown with an asterisk. Samples newly sequenced for this study are shown with gray shading. Parsimony bootstrap (BS) values are shown above branches, Bayesian posterior probabilities (PP) are shown below branches. Support values are shown only for branches with BS>75. Outgroup taxon (C. xanthanthus) used for ancestral state construction not shown."
