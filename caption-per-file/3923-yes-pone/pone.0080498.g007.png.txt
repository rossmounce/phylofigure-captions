Phylogenetic position of Cyatta abscondita.This phylogeny of 66 fungus-farming and 26 outgroup ant species results from a Bayesian analysis of four nuclear protein-coding genes (see text for details). Fungus-farming ant species are indicated by bold black branches; the branch subtending Cyatta abscondita is indicated in red. Gray branches correspond to non-fungus-farming taxa. Blue dots on branches represent Bayesian posterior probabilities of 100; orange dots represent Bayesian posterior probabilities of 95–99. Divergence time of Cyatta and Kalathomyrmex estimated at 26 Ma (95% CI= 18–34) and divergence of the clade (Cyatta Kalathomyrmex) from the rest of the Neoattini estimated at 44 Ma (95% CI= 37–51)."
