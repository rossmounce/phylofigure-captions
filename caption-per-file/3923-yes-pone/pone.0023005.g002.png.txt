Bayesian phylogenetic tree of ATOH8 gene. The gene tree was built on the basis of complete coding DNA sequence alignment (2713 bp including gaps) of 20 species. The fruit fly NET gene was used as outgroup. Only branches with a posterior probability of at least 0.75 are shown. Branch support indicates the posterior probabilities and Maximum Likelihood Bootstrap."
