"pone.0078680.g005.png","The phylogenetic tree of Vitis based on SNP genotype calls differs from the phylogenetic generated using array hybridization intensities.A) Neighbour-joining (NJ) tree from FST estimates derived from SNP genotype calls from the Vitis9KSNP array. B) NJ tree from a distance measure derived from hybridization intensities from the Vitis9KSNP array."
