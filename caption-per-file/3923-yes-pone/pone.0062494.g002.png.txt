"pone.0062494.g002.png","Phylogenetic relationship of rice and Arabidopsis PLC gene family.An un-rooted neighbour joining phylogenetic tree was constructed from the protein sequences of rice and Arabidopsis PLCs, including both PI-PLCs and NPCs. Multiple sequence alignment was carried out using clustalX2.0 and the tree was generated using MEGA5. Rice and Arabidopsis PI-PLCs and NPCs are clustered together based on significant bootstrap value (>50%). Scale bar indicates 0.1 amino acid substitution per site."
