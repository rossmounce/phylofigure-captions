Proton ATPases.A. Plasma membrane ATPases (Pma). Gene phylogeny (above) of homologues from Hortaea werneckii (HwPma), Mycosphaerella graminicola (MgPma1: XP_003852209.1) and Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Pma1: YGL008C, Pma2: YPL036W), rooted by a homologue from Cryptococcus neoformans (XP_568571.1). Two half-circles mark a duplication after the separation of S. cerevisiae and H. werneckii ancestors, but before the separation of H. werneckii and M. graminicola, black circles on the bifurcation mark recent duplications presumably resulting from a whole genome duplication. Transcription profiles (below) of plasma membrane H+-ATPases of H. werneckii homologues at different concentrations of NaCl (w/v). Quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed with RNA isolated from cells grown in YNB medium, supplemented with 0, 5, 10, 17, and 25% NaCl (w/v). Quantification cycle (Cq) values for our genes of interest were normalised to the quantification cycle of 28S rRNA fragment (reference gene). The difference in Cq values (relative mRNA level values) between the target gene and the reference gene was calculated, and these values of the different samples were compared directly. Data are means of relative mRNA level values obtained by two qRT-PCR experiments performed with biological triplicates. B. The subunit A of the vacuolar ATPases (Vma1). Gene phylogeny (above) of homologues from Hortaea werneckii (HwVma), Mycosphaerella graminicola (MgVma1: XP_003850333.1) and Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Vma1: YDL185W), rooted by a homologue from Cryptococcus neoformans (XP_570895.1). Black circles on the bifurcation marks a recent duplication presumably resulting from a whole genome duplication. Transcription profiles (below) of vacuolar H+-ATPases of H. werneckii homologues at different concentrations of NaCl (w/v). Quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) experiment and the analysis of the data was performed as described above."
