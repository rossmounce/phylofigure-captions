A whole genome phylogeny of 136 sequenced genomes in the genus Acinetobacter.The phylogeny was inferred with FastTree2 [52] on a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) matrix alignment calculated with kSNP [50] and filtered with noisy [51]. The phylogeny was rooted with A. radioresistens. Genomes sequenced in the current study are shown in red. Genomes in the Acinetobacter calcoaceticus-baumannii (Acb) complex are colored by clade."
