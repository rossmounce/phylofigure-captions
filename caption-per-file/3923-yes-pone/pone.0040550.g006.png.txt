Neighbor joining phylogenetic tree.The tree is composed of fungal sequences generated in this study and their respective closest BLAST hits. Branches with bootstrap support â‰¥70 shown in bold. The two colored rings surrounding the tree indicate the plant genus (innermost ring) and the type of substrate (second ring) from which the fungal sequences in this study were obtained. Fungal genera are indicated outside the substrate ring. Fungal classes are indicated by the grey outermost ring. Classes are abbreviated as follows: Aga, Agaricomycetes; Ags, Agaricostilbomycetes; Art, Arthoniomycetes; Atc, Atractiellomycetes; Dot, Dothideomycetes; Eur, Eurotiomycetes; Exo, Exobasidiomycetes; Leo, Leotiomycetes; Mic, Microbotryomycetes; Sac, Saccharomycetes; Sor, Sordariomyctetes; Tap, Taphrinomycetes; Tre, Tremellomycetes. Classes that came out paraphyletic on the tree (Dot and Art; Tre and Aga) are indicated with a black border around the grey bar."
