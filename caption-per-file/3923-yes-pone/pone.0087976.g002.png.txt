"pone.0087976.g002.png","Phylogenetic tree of nifK genes.The phylogenetic tree was constructed by the neighbor-joining method using MEGA, version 4.0 with 1000 bootstrap repetitions. The sequences obtained from metagenomic sequencing of acid mine drainage are designated DX_SY_, followed by their number in library. These sequences are shown in bold. Only some representatives of 93 nifK sequences are shown here. The scale represents the number of amino acid substitutions per site."
