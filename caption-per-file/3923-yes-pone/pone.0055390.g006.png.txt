Recombination within the prophage-associated ANK gene WD0633.A) The relative bootstrap support values (1000 bootstrap resampling) are shown, calculated for a moving 200 bp window with a 10bp step size across the alignment of the WD0633 homologs. For each alignment-window, nucleotide distances and phylogenetic trees were produced using the neighbor joining method. The dotted line indicates 70% cutoff. Gray rectangles represent the positions of the ankyrin repeats in the alignment. B, C) ML phylogeny of Wolbachia strains reconstructed separately for the 5? and 3? regions of WD0633 supports the group shift of the putative recombinant strain (wAu)."
