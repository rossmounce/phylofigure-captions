"pone.0011487.g002.png","Phylogenetic analysis of the RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase of Reoviridae.Full length amino acid sequences were aligned using the ClustalX[18] implemented on MEGA software[19] and refined using T-Coffee[20] to incorporate protein structure data. Phylogenetic analysis was performed using p-distance as model of amino acid substitution as implemented by ICTV for analysis of the Reoviridae family[22]. MEGA was used to produce phylogenetic trees, reconstructed through the Neighbor Joining (NJ) method. The statistical significance of a particular tree topology was evaluated by bootstrap re-sampling of the sequences 1000 times."
