"pone.0038515.g001.png","MALDI-TOF mass spectrograms, (panel A) and 16S rRNA gene sequence phylogram, (panel B) for four Vibrio isolates from the North Sea.Panel A, the X axis indicates the mass to charge ratios (m/z) of each peak and the Y axis for each individual plot indicates intensity of the peaks. The identification result using Biotyper software is shown at the top-right corner of each plot followed by the type strain designation. Several mass spectral peaks are common between the isolates and a few show differences, examples of similar peaks are aligned by dotted lines. Panel B, distance phylogram tree of the isolates, over 1500 nucleotides."
