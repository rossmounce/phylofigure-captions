A consensus phylogenetic tree of 117 HPV L1 sequences. The evolutionary history was inferred using the Minimum Evolution method [19] and the consensus tree was inferred from 1,000 bootstrap replicates. The evolutionary distances were computed using the Maximum Composite Likelihood method [18] and are in units of the number of base substitutions per site. Bootstrap values for members of Alphapapillomavirus species 2 are given above the main tree. The GenBank account numbers of the HPV genotypes are given next to the genotypes' name, where available."
