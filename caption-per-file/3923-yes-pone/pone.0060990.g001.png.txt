TMK Subfamily of RLKs and Gene Expression Patterns.(A) The phylogenic tree of the TMK subfamily and its closest relatives in flowering plants. TMK1 (At1g66150); TMK2 (At1g24650); TMK3 (At2g01820) and TMK4 (At3g23750) are all from Arabidopsis. OsTMK, Os9632 and Os 9639 are from Oryza sativa, NtTMK1 from Nicotiana tabacum, and RHG4 from Glycine max. (B) Domain organizations showing intron locations (green triangle) and T-DNA positions (red triangle) for each of the TMK family members. Shared features include signal peptide (yellow), multiple leucine rich repeats (green), transmembrane region (black) and kinase domain (blue). (C) Quantitation of transcript abundance for each member of the TMK subfamily of RLKs. TMK1, TMK3 and TMK4 are expressed at approximately equal levels in all organs examined, while TMK2 expression can only be detected in the flowers and siliques. (D) Expression patterns of GUS reporter driven by TMK1, TMK2, TMK3 and TMK4 native promoters in seedlings and flowers. Scale bars: 10 mm. (E) Expression of TMK1 is associated with the plasma membrane in the mature zone of root in Arabidopsis as indicated by TMK1:GFP lines in which the TMK1 promoter was translationally fused with GFP. Scale bar: 50 Âµm. (F) TMK1 is an integral membrane protein as determined by crude protein extracted from Arabidopsis seedlings. Note expression of other membrane-associated proteins AHA2 and SEC12 as controls. T: total protein, P: membrane pellet, S: soluble fraction."
