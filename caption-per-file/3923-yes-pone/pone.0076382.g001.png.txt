Map of sample locations along Caney Fork River in Tennessee and Yadkin River in North Carolina along with phylogenetic tree for the 23 individuals of P. deltoides generated from 20 simple sequences repeat markers.Each symbol on the maps represents the location of each tree sampled along the river and the corresponding symbol in the phylogenetic tree represents the genotypic relationships amongst individual hosts. The size of the symbol on the branch corresponds to the number of trees in each of the three putative host clonal groups."
