"pone.0013144.g001.png","Phylogenetic relationships of Ostrinia moths and sex pheromones.Minor components of sex pheromones are indicated by an asterisk. O. nubilalis and O. scapulalis exhibit polymorphism in sex pheromones (Z and E types). Z11-14:OAc, E11-14:OAc, Z12-14:OAc, and E12-14:OAc denote (Z)-11-tetradecenyl acetate, (E)-11-tetradecenyl acetate, (Z)-12-tetradecenyl acetate, and (E)-12-tetradecenyl acetate, respectively. The phylogenetic tree was constructed by the neighbor-joining method using mitochondrial COII gene sequences [29]."
