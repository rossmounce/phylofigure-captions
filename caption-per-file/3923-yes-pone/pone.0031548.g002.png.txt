"pone.0031548.g002.png","Staphylococcus capitis isolates from distant neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) are clonal. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) was applied to 53 bloodstream isolates of S. capitis that were collected from NICU infants and adult patients from cities spanning the French territory. The PFGE dendrogram was generated using the GelCompar software version 4.1. The isolates were assigned to pulsotypes using >80% similarity (vertical dashed line). Staphylococcal chromosomal cassette mec (SCCmec) typing was applied to 23 methicillin-resistant isolates representative of each pulsotype and geographic origin. All methicillin-resistant isolates from the different NICUs belonged to the same pulsotype and shared a type V-related SCCmec element, whereas methicillin-susceptible and/or non-NICU isolates were genetically diverse. ccr, chromosomal cassette recombinase; unkn., unknown (a combination of the mec complex and ccr genes has not been assigned to an SCCmec type so far)."
