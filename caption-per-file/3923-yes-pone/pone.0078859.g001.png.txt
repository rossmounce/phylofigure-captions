Unrooted phylogenetic tree and distribution of conserved domains in maize Aux/IAA proteins.The phylogenetic tree reveals two classes (A and B) of Aux/IAA proteins that differ in the sequence of domain III. The structure of the Aux/IAA proteins and the distribution of their domains are displayed to the right. The scale bar corresponds to 10 amino acids (aa). Paralogous Aux/IAA genes are encircled. The values associated to each branch are bootstrap percentages. The size bar indicates sequence divergence : 0.1 = 10%."
