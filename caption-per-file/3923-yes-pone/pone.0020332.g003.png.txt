Phylogenetic trees of sdr genes revealed the evolutional relationship among S. aureus strains and isolates. The graph was constructed by using MEGA software (version 4.0) with the NJ method and bootstrap values were provided as percents over 1000 replications. Alignment gaps were considered complete deletion. A) Phylogenetic tree of sdrC gene. Q&E represents the isolates from Quebec and Eastern Canada; O&W represents the isolates from Ontario and Western Canada. B) Phylogenetic trees of sdrD, sdrE and sdrH genes. Canada in the sdrD phylogenetic tree denotes the isolates from all four Canadian regions."
