Phylogenetic tree analysis of the Cape Verde HIV-2 pol region samples (black circles and squares).The phylogenetic inferences were performed by the Neighbor-Joining algorithm under the Kimura-2 parameter nucleotide substitution model using the MEGA v5.0 package. Reference sequences from HIV-2 Group A and B are included and represented as white circles. The scale represents the number of substitutions per site."
