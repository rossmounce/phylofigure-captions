"pone.0020365.g005.png","Genomic structures, phylogeny and predicted palindromes in subregion B. (A) The diagonal lines from the left top to the right bottom indicates identity within the human (left panel) or the macaque (right panel) sequence. Gaps in the diagonal line in the macaque indicate sequencing gaps. The colored boxes at the bottom of each panel indicate seven duplicated units. The same colored boxes within a species indicate that they are more closely related to each other than to others, whereas those between species indicate putative orthologs. (B) Palindromes predicted in subregion B of the human (left) or the macaque (right) sequence. Numbers beside the lines indicate each duplicated unit. (C) An NJ tree based on p-distances between duplicated units (2880 bp) is shown. The color-code for OTU is the same as in (A) and (B)."
