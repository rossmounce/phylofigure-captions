ML phylogenetic tree showing the placement of Strepsiptera sister to Neuropterida and interrelationships of other holometabolous insects based on the combined analysis of DNA sequence data from 7 single-copy nuclear protein-coding genes.Bayesian posterior probabilities ≥0.50 and ML BS values ≥50% are shown above branches (BPP/BS). Images of insect exemplars are not to scale. Images of Raphidioptera and Megaloptera copyright Ainsley Seago, other insect images copyright Australian Museum. * Halictophagidae/Myrmecolacidae"
