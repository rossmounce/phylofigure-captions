Neighbor-joining string-based phylogenetic tree vs. W-curve-based tree.Envelop C2-V5 from the 051 mother/infant pair grouping from a study previously conducted in Thailand [17]. The string based tree at the left compares the infant sequences to the maternal viruses from different compartments and CM240 as a reference subtype: (I) infant peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) DNA-derived sequences; M, maternal PBMC DNA-derived sequences; P, maternal plasma-derived sequences; CW, cervical secretion-derived sequences. Numbers at the nodes represent the maximum parsimony bootstrap value. Branch lengths between the sequences are proportionate to the scale bar and indicate the number of mutations per base position per unit time. The tree at the right is the W-curve-based tree. Note the similarity in the clustering patterns. The remaining phenograms are available in the supporting data for this paper [11]."
