"pone.0039826.g001.png","Hypothesized phylogenetic relationships of apocritan Hymenoptera studied in this investigation [4], [12].Taxa with sequenced genomes are highlighted in green; their genome sequences were analyzed to identify single-copy genes and to design degenerate oligonucleotide PCR primers. DNA of non-highlighted species was used to assess the functionality of the inferred PCR and sequencing primers."
