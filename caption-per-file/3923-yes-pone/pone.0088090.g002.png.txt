Phylogenetic analysis of cyclophilins.A circular phylogram representation of the cyclophilin sequences collected from various taxa. M. tuberculosis PpiA is grouped with eukaryotic and actinobacterial counterparts quite distinct from the prokaryotic clades of cyclophilins. The colored labels are used as follows: human cyclophilins ? green, M. tuberculosis and Mycobacterium leprae PpiA ? red, M. tuberculosis and M. leprae PpiB ? brown, E. coli cyclophilins ? pink and selected gut microbial cyclophilin ? dark blue."
