"pone.0020843.g006.png","Phylogeny of Wolbachia based on 16S rDNA gene sequences. Names at the terminal nodes are those of the host species (with the exceptions of the outgroup species). Aâ€“J are the supergroups names according to [1], [3], [8], [14]. The tree has been obtained by Bayesian inference of phylogeny, using MrBayes 2.01; numbers at the nodes are the posterior probability values. Species in bold are those newly found positive in the screening for Wolbachia performed in this study. Accession numbers are given for the sequences present in the databases."
