Evolutionary relationship of Saga species estimated from the nuclear DNA sequences.Panel A: Maximum Parsimony phylogenetic tree of Saginae based on ITS2 sequences. The consistency index was 0.91, whereas the retention index was 0.966 for MP tree. The composite index was 0.888 for all sites and 0.879 for the parsimony-informative sites. There were a total of 829 positions in the final dataset, out of which 95 were parsimony-informative. Vertical bars at right indicate the species. Bootstrap values are presented at each node. The unrooted tree showed the S. ephippigera-ornata clade as most basal group. The transient S. cappadocica is positioned between the Asian S. ephippigera-ornata and the European Saga linegae (S. hellenica, S. rammei, S. pedo, S. c. gracilis, S. c. campbelli, S. natoliae). Panel B:Asian Saga species have a long insertion in their ITS2 sequence, compared to that of European species. Evolutionary relationship of the ITS2 insertions is presented in a Neighbor-Joining tree. The tree is drawn to scale, with branch lengths in the same units as those of the evolutionary distances used to infer the phylogenetic tree. The evolutionary distances were computed using the Maximum Composite Likelihood method and are in the units of the number of base substitutions per site."
