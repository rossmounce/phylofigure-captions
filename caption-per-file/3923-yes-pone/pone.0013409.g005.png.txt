"pone.0013409.g005.png","Improved ABC transporter gene models in C. briggsae (A) and C. remanei (B) and phylogenetic tree positioning the three newly identified genes within ABC transporter gene family C (C).Panel A shows the current gene model of C. briggsae gene CBG000495 (Cbr-mrp-8) as well as the improved gene model obtained by running genBlastG with default parameters using C. elegans ortholog Y75B8A.26 as query (http://genome.sfu.ca/genblast/). Panel B shows both current and improved gene model for the C. remanei gene CRE17131 (Cre-mrp-1) using C. elegans ortholog F57C12.5c (longest confirmed isoforms) as query. The phylogenetic tree shows the evolutionary relationship of the three new ABC transporter genes CBG08354, CRE25095, and CRE14222 (indicated by arrows) with known C. elegans, C. briggsae, and C. remanei ABC transporters of family C. Tree is drawn to scale (number of substitutions per site). Numbers at branch points represent bootstrap values from 1,000 iterations."
