"pone.0070384.g002.png","Domain structure and phylogenetic tree of the 19 Arabidopsis chloroplast J proteins.(A) Schematic representations of domain structures of the 19 Arabidopsis chloroplast J proteins. Each bar is drawn to scale according to the number of amino acids, shown at the bottom. Names of land plant-specific J proteins are written in blue. J, J domain; Gly/Phe-rich, glycine/phenylalanine-rich domain; Zn2+ finger, zinc-finger domain; C-terminal, C-terminal domain; Fd, ferredoxin domain; TRP, tetratricopeptide repeat domain. (B) Phylogenetic relationship of the 19 Arabidopsis chloroplast J proteins. A neighbor-joining tree was constructed using multiple sequence alignments from peptide sequences of the 19 chloroplast J proteins. Bootstrap analyses were computed with 1,000 replicates, and the values of percentage larger than 85 are shown on the branches. Grouping of four clades (shown with gray background) had at least 85% bootstrap support."
