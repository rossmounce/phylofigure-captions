"pone.0024980.g001.png","Bayesian partitioned mitogenome phylogeny. Clades are collapsed. Branch colours indicate geographic origin of samples as follows: Antarctic (grey), Atlantic (blue) and Pacific (red). The predominant ecotype or type in each clade is as follows: clade 1: Pacific transient; clade 2: Atlantic haplotypes from the Icelandic and Norwegian herring-eating populations and Gibraltar tuna-eating population; clade 3: Pacific resident; clade 4: Atlantic haplotypes from UK, Canary Islands and Iceland; clade 5: Pacific offshore; clade 6: Antarctic type C; clade 7: Antarctic type B; clade 8: Antarctic type A; clade 9: Atlantic haplotypes from Scotland, Canary Island and Gulf of Mexico. Posterior probabilities are given for nodes of interest. The tree is rooted with long-finned pilot whale (not shown)."
