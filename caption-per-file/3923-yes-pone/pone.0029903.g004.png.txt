"pone.0029903.g004.png","A quick view of different steps needed for phylogenetic inference with Armadillo. Step A: Search dialog box allowing for direct access to different Internet databases. Step B: Creating and interconnecting individual components by means of drag-and-drop operations. Muscle and ProbCons multiple sequence alignment applications are presented here. Step C: Representing the aligned sequences using an internal sequence viewer. Step D: Configuring the options of the PhyML and ProtDist applications prior to phylogenetic inference. Step E: Visualizing the resulting PhyML phylogenetic tree using the Archaeopteryx tree viewer. Panel (F): Displaying the complete computational workflow after a sequential execution of the first (multiple sequence alignment algorithms) and second (phylogenetic tree inference algorithms) workflow parts."
