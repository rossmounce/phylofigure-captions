"pone.0071148.g002.png","Unrooted Maximum Likelihood phylogenetic analysis of the concatenated SCAR-MLST dataset.The STs corresponding to haplotypes H17, H24, H27 and H28, being the ancestral lineages in the coalescence gene genealogy analysis, were found to be the most basal lineages when rooted with C. gattii AFLP4. Populations are indicated as AFR (Africa), AUS (Australasia), EUR (Europe), NA (North America) and SA (South America), followed by symbols indicating clinical (), environmental (?) and/or veterinary (?) strains within the given ST. The most ancestral lineage H17 is indicated by a tree to highlight its environmental origin from a tree in pristine Amazon rainforest in Northern Brazil. STs that fell into H01 as the major genotype AFLP6A/VGIIa Vancouver Island outbreak lineage, H02 as the case cluster of C. gattii infections among psittacine birds in Brazil, H03 the minor genotype Vancouver Island outbreak lineage (ST4 and ST5), and the recently emerged genotype AFLP6C/VGIIc outbreak in the Pacific Northwest (ST39) are indicated with symbols referring to their respective origin (e.g. human referring to human infections, cat representing veterinary cases, dolphin representing infections among sea animals) (Fig. 1; Table 1 and S3). Bootstrap values are given for branches that are highly supported (?75)."
