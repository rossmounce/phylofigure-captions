Phylogenetic tree of 237 MLST genotypes (STs) of Microcystis aeruginosa. Bootstrap statistical support was indicated in the major branches. Seven major groups (groups Aâ€“G [5]) and a putative hybrid group (group X, suggested by microcystin gene analyses [6]) were color-coded. Note that the hybrid nature of group X was not supported by the result of BAPS analysis of MLST genes. Arrows indicate the panmictic lineage with the number of loci used for LD analysis. The dotted boxes indicate the subset of that group analyzed for LD. The result of admixture analysis is indicated on the right side of the phylogenetic tree where each bar indicates the origin of gene segments of the color corresponding to the phylogenetic group defined by the MLST phylogeny. In addition to the three STs mentioned in the text, ST18 is highlighted in boldface because it represents NIES-843, for which the entire genome sequence is available [45]. The putative ecotypes identified by Ecotype Simulation analysis are also indicated within the black bar. Note that ST49, 99, and 202, which are paraphyletic in the NJ tree, were identified as members of the same ecotype, thus being connected by the black line."
