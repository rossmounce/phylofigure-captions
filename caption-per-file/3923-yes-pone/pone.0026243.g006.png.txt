"pone.0026243.g006.png","Neighbor-Joining phylogenetic tree based of 16 S rRNA of ε- and γ-proteobacteria of epibionts found on Kiwa puravida n. sp. Tree's were rooted using Leucothrix mucor (X87277) and Sulfurospirillum arcachonense (Y11561) for ε- and γ- proteobacteria, respectively, and the roots are not shown. Sequence from Table 1 were excluded from these trees if they were less than 1000 base pairs. Bootstrap confidence, based on 3000 iterations, are indicated in grey. Scale bar equals number of substitutions per nucleotide."
