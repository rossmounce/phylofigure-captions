Phylogenetic trees of Seriatopora hystrix and associated Symbiodinium lineages.(A) Phylogenetic tree (maximum likelihood) of S. hystrix mitochondrial haplotypes, with Seriatopora caliendrum and Pocillopora damicornis as outgroups. Bootstrap values (in italics) are based on Bayesian analyses and ML respectively, with only probabilities over 50% shown. The shaded box groups the various S. hystrix haplotypes observed in this study. The ‘HostU’ and ‘HostD1’ haplotypes match with previously obtained Genbank sequences. (B) Unrooted phylogenetic tree (maximum parsimony) of the five distinct Symbiodinium types. Colors group ITS2 sequences belonging to a single Symbiodinium type (for example Symbiodinium type C120 contains only the ITS2 sequence C120 while Symbiodnium C120a contains both the C120 and C120a sequence within its genome). Bootstrap values higher than 50% are shown in italics."
