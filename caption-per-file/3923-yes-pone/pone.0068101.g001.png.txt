Maximum likelihood tree of ITS fungal haplotypes from three ant-plant-fungus symbioses.A total of 42 haplotypes (based on sequences of 647 aligned nucleotides) of Chaetothyriales were detected in fungal patches of the following ant-plant symbioses: Petalomyrmex phylax/Leonardoxa africana subsp. africana (MOTUs in orange), Aphomomyrmex afer/Leonardoxa subsp. letouzeyi (MOTU in green) and Tetraponera aethiops/Barteria fistulosa (MOTUs in blue). Note that haplotype Kh1 is labelled in green because it was detected in the system Aphomomyrmex/Leonardoxa, although it is phylogenetically most closely related to MOTU Y1. The position of each MOTU on the tree is indicated by the intersection of the branches and the dotted lines. Branch tip labels highlighted in grey correspond to fungal strains obtained in previous studies following a culturing approach. For each symbiosis, the image on the left displays a domatium cut longitudinally to expose ants and a fungal patch (dark area on the inner surface). MOTU: Molecular Operational Taxonomic Unit."
