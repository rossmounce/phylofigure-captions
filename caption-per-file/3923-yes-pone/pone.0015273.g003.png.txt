Maximum Likelihood phylogenies of the Rhizopus oryzae complex clearly delimit the two cryptic species, Rhizopus oryzae s. s. and Rhizopus delemar. (A) sexP alleles, (B) sexM alleles, (C) concatenated phylogram of rDNA ITS1-5.8S-ITS2, RPB2, TPT gene, and RNA helicase gene, and (D) four-gene strict consensus tree. Analysis included a total of 458 (+), 635 (âˆ’) and 3064 (MLS) nucleotide characters. ML bootstrap proportions higher than 70 are shown above the nodes. Asterisks (*) indicate strains that produced zygospores. Filled circles indicate a single R. delemar strain, CBS329.47, closest to the ancestral state."
