"pone.0074803.g002.png","TCP ECE gene phylogeny in basal and core eudicots.Phylogeny was inferred by ML analysis of the aligned nucleotide sequences between, and including, the TCP and R domains (339 characters). Clades with â‰¥50% Shimodaira-Hasegawa (SH)-like support are shown. SH values are given below or to the left of each branch; posterior probabilities (PPs) from the Bayesian analysis of the same dataset are given after. Stars show resolved duplication events inferred from this tree. Sequence names are color-coded; basal eudicots: blue, Gunneratinctoria: red, Pentapetalae: black."
