"pone.0082089.g003.png","Phylogenetic analysis of H3N2 NA gene segments.*Phylogenetic tree of influenza A/H3N2 using the Neighbor-Joining method and Bootstrap test (1000 replicates). The evolutionary distances were computed using the Maximum Composite Likelihood method. The phylogenetic tree was generated using MEGA4 software. Phylogenetic analysis rooted to the 2009 influenza vaccine strain (A/Brisbane/10/2007)."
