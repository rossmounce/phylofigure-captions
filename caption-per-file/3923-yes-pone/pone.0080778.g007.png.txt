Phylogenetic position of Djebelemur in a high-level primate phylogeny with a cladistic assessment of the craniodental and postcranial evidence performed without molecular scaffold.A?C, consensus trees (A, Strict; B, Majority Rule at 80%) of 3426 equally most-parsimonious trees of 3886 steps each (CI?=?0.147; RI?=?0.566), which were obtained after analyses performed considering some multistate characters as ordered (i.e., if changes from one state to another require passing through intermediate states); C, consensus tree (Majority Rule at 80%) of 64 equally most-parsimonious trees of 3593 steps each (CI?=?0.159; RI?=?0.542), which were obtained after analyses performed considering all characters as unordered. On the Majority Rule consensus trees (B and C), the values above or below the nodes correspond to the rates (%) of node occurrences across the whole equally most-parsimonious trees found."
