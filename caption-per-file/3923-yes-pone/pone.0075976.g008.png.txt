"pone.0075976.g008.png","The phylogenetic tree of the BCARR.Homologous protein sequences were identified by BLASTP searches (cutoff e-value >10?50). An unrooted phylogenetic tree displaying branch lengths that was built using ClustalW and the NJ algorithm is shown. To simplify the tree, one sequence was selected from each genus. For the genus Lactobacillus, four sequences were selected from the delbruekii subgroup including L. helveticus, one sequence from each subgroup other than the delbruekii subgroup as defined in the previous report [25]. The scale bar represents base changes per site. A. : Alloiococcus, B. : Bacillus, D. : Dolosigranulum, E. : Enterococcus, F. : Fructobacillus, G. : Granulicatella, Ls. : Leuconostoc, Li. : Listeria, M. : Melissococcus, P. : Pediococcus, T. : Tetragenococcus, W. : Weissella. * Carnobacteriaceae also includes G. adiacens."
