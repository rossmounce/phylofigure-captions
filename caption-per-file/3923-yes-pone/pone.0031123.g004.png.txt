"pone.0031123.g004.png","Tests of alternative topologies concerning Malpaisomys phylogenetic position among Muridae (SH-, AU-tests and Bayes Factors). The best topology is indicated in bold. BF values higher than 10 were considered as a very strong evidence favouring one hypothesis (i.e. the topology with the highest likelihood score) over the other [29]. *** indicates BF factors where the BI tree topology (LnL0 = −36,296.42) is significantly better than the tested alternative topology."
