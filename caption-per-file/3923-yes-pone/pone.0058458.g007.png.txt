"pone.0058458.g007.png","Proposed hypotheses for the loss of the original (common opisthokontal) FeCH gene and the re-acquisition of alpha-proteobacterial FeCH in the evolution of the phylum Nematoda.The initial loss of the common opisthokontal FeCH gene may have occurred at the common ancestor level (red arrows). (a) Scenario 1: The first scenario hypothesizes that alpha-proteobacterial FeCH was acquired independently by some species in clades III and IV (green arrows). b) Scenario 2: Reacquisition of FeCH from an alpha-proteobacterium may have occurred at the common ancestor level of clades III, IV and V (blue arrow) followed by a secondary loss in some species in clade III and IV and in the branch leading to clade V (pink arrows). The phylogenetic relationships of the nematode clades are based on Sommer and Streit [10]."
