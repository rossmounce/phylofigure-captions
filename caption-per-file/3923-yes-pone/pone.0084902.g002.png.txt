Phylogenetic relationships of NRPS A-domains specific for L-proline or its derivatives.A rooted, neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree was constructed based on the full length amino acid sequences of stand-alone A-domains and excised sequences of modular A-domains. Bootstrap values (100 replicates) above 50% are indicated at the nodes. Modular A-domains are represented by name of respective NRPS module and marked with a ■, stand-alone A-domains are marked with a ▲. The substrates for each domain include L-proline (Pro), L-proline derivatives with one carbon side chains (Pro1C), L-proline derivatives with two carbon side chains (Pro2C), and L-proline derivatives with three carbon side chain (Pro3C). Those A-domains specific for Pro2C or Pro3C substrates are highlighted. Number in parentheses behind the name of respective NRPS denotes the number of the module in NRPS protein chain, if relevant; letter in parentheses denotes the source organism. The GenBank accession numbers, producing strains, and references describing each A-domain are listed. Percent sequence identities with LmbC and CcbC were calculated from pairwise alignments. Figure S1A shows an identical phylogenetic tree reflecting phylogenetic distances, Figure S1B shows the identical set analysis using maximum likelihood method."
