Phylogenetic Analysis of 1070 nt Region of the HBV Pol Gene of Specimens Identified in the IVVI Study.The taxons and branches of Vietnamese specimens whose sequences were identified in this study are coloured by sample location from Ha Noi (red), Hai Phong (orange), Da Nang (purple), Khanh Hoa (blue) and Can Tho (green). Sequence taxons are coded by population group including intravenous drug users (IDU), sex workers (SW), dialysis patients (DIAL), multiply transfused patients (MTF), military recruits (MIL), pregnant women (PRE), blood donors (BD) and elective surgery patients (SUR). Figure 2A represents a phylogenetic analysis of genotype B sequences, including 152 sequences from HBV subtype B described in this study, with 64 reference sequences (labelled with their Genbank accession numbers and country of isolation). Branches of reference sequences from groups A, C, D, E, F, G and H are collapsed. The newly described putative subgenotype B6–B9 sequences were included and branches have been collapsed. Figure 2B represents 26 sequences from HBV subtype C described in this study, with 73 reference sequences. Brackets denote the subgenotypes identified in this study and the number of IVVI sequences in these groups. Genbank accession numbers for the study sequences are JQ281112–JQ281258 and JQ281468–JQ281471."
