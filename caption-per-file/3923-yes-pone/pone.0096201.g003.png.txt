"pone.0096201.g003.png","Phylogenetic tree and bootscan analyses of the pol region of HIV-1 URF samples from Cape Verde.(A) The phylogenetic inferences were performed by the Neighbor-Joining algorithm under the Kimura-2 parameter nucleotide substitution model using the MEGA v5.0 package. The scale represents the number of substitutions per site. Cape Verde and reference sequences are represented respectively as colored and white circles. (B) Recombinant profiles were inferred using a sliding window of 200 bp, steps of 20 bp and the Kimura-2 parameters model using SimPlot 3.5.1 software. Reference samples corresponding to the major HIV-1 subtypes are indicated by different colors. Partial NJ phylogenetic trees using K-2p model were performed for bootscan fragments under 70% and were represented as I - 150 bp and II and III - 300 bp."
