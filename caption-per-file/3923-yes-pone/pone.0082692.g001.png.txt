Bayesian phylogram (majority rule tree) of subtribe Lactucinae based on nrITS dataset including coded indels.Posterior probabilities (PP) are given below the branches, the jackknife support values (JK) of the corresponding Maximum Parsimony majority rule consensus tree above the branches. Reference point for the names of Chinese taxa is in general the morphology-based taxonomy of Shih (1997), whereas the clade names at the vertical bars on the right show our revised generic classification outlined in more detail and with the relevant synonymies in the Taxonomic conclusions."
