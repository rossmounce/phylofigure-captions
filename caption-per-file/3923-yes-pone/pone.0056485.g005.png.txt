"pone.0056485.g005.png","Most likely ancestral ranges reconstruction of the Clupeoidei during the Cretaceous and early Cenozoic period using the dispersal?extinction?cladogenesis (DEC) model [116], [117] onto a simplified Bayesian phylogenetic chronogram.Outgroups (i.e., non-clupeoids) were deleted and biogeographically redundant clupeoid taxa were merged with their respective sister group (see material and methods for details). Ancestral ranges at nodes within each major lineage not reconstructed. Horizontal timescale in million of years ago (Mya) (Paleogene epoch abbreviations: Paleo, Paleocene; Eo, Eocene; and Oligo, Oligocene). Most likely ancestral ranges reconstruction at nodes indicated by code-color boxes (see Fig. 1B for correspondence between regions and two or three-letter codes and colors). Black arrows indicate the three dispersal events predating or likely predating the K-Pg boundary and black arrowheads indicate subsequent allopatric cladogenesis. Temperate lineage branches are underlined in blue and white arrowheads indicate marine to freshwater transitions. ?*? after a species name indicates that closely related species to this species have been pruned (see material and methods for details); ?**? after a species name indicates that this species is a representative of a supra-specific group having a larger geographical distribution. ?NC? at nodes indicate that the ancestral ranges were not estimated at these nodes. On the left side, the spatio-temporal context is illustrated with four schematic paleoreconstructions (at 90, 65 and 50 Mya) on which are indicated the temporally corresponding clupeoid fossil localities by white (marine/brackish) and grey (freshwater) stars. Emerged lands are displayed in black and marine environments in blue with the shallow parts in lighter blue. One additional reconstruction (D) shows the current geographical context with the biogeographical units. The clupeoid fossil localities are: 1- the Cenomanian locality ?Loma la Mula? in Coahuila, northeastern Mexico (taxon:?Scombroclupea occidentalis currently considered as a clupeid incertae sedis) [88]; 2- the marine shale yielded in the Taquari Member (Albian) of Riachuelo Formation (state of Sergipe, Northeastern Brazil) (taxon:?Nolfia riachuelensis currently considered as a clupeid ad interim) [81]; 3- the marine deposit from the Cenomanian of Kipala, Democratic Republic of Congo (taxon:?Nolfia kwangoensis currently considered as a clupeid incertae sedis) and the marine Santonian of Vonso, Democratic Republic of Congo (taxon:?Audenaerdia casieri currently considered as a clupeid incertae sedis) [85], [89]; 4- the Cenomanian (Upper Cretaceous) Komen (Slovenia) fossil lagerst?tte (taxon: ?Scombroclupea macrophthalma currently considered as a clupeoid incertae sedis); [83], [138]; 5- the Cenomanian fossil fish localities of Lebanon (e.g., Namoura, Hakel and Hajula) (taxa: ?Scombroclupea spp. currently considered as clupeoids incertae sedis) [83]; 6- the Upper Cretaceous (Maastrichtian) of Cayara, El Molino Formation, Bolivia (taxon:?Gastroclupea branisai currently considered as a pristigasterid incertae sedis) [39], [81]; 7- the Upper Cretaceous (Campano-Maastrichtian limit, 74.0 Mya) marine sediments of Nard?, Italy (taxa: ?Portoselvaggioclupea whiteheadi and ?Nardoclupea grandei [Dussumieriinae], ?Pugliaclupea nolardi [Clupeinae], ?Lecceclupea ehiravaensis [Pellonulinae], and ?Italoclupea nolfi [Alosinae]) [51]?[54]; 8- The Middle Paleocene Tongue River Formation (lacustrine limestone), near Bay Horse, Montana, USA (taxon: ?Knightia vetusta currently considered as a clupeoid incertae sedis) [40]; 9- the Middle Eocene Laney Member of the Green River Formation, southwestern Wyoming, USA (lacustrine deposits)(taxon: ?Gosiutichthys parvus currently considered as a clupeoid incertae sedis) and the Lower Eocene lacustrine sediments of Wyoming, Colorado and Utah, USA (taxa: ?Knightia alta and ?Knightia eocaena currently considered as clupeoids incertae sedis) [40]; 10- the Lower Eocene (52.0 Mya) marine sediments of Monte Bolca, Italy (taxa: several species of Clupeidae including at least one species of Dussumieriinae sensu Grande [18]); 11- the Upper Paleocene freshwater lacustrine deposits of Bamanbor and Ninania of Saurashtra, India (taxon: ?Horaclupea intertrappea currently considered as a clupeid incertae sedis) and the Eocene Saline Series of the Salt range of Pakistan (taxon: the clupeid ?Horaclupea geei) [18]; 12- the Late Paleocene fish fauna of the Danata Formation in Turkmenistan (taxon: ?Primisardinella genetrix currently considered as a clupeid incertae sedis) [18] and 13- the Eocene (probably freshwater) deposits of Hupei, China (taxon: ?Knightia yuyanga currently considered as a clupeid incertae sedis) [18]."
