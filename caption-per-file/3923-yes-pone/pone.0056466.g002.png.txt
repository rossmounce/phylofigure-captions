"pone.0056466.g002.png","Reversion RAMs accumulate in strains exposed to daptomycin and in one copy of a multicopy protein.Ancestor states for each reversion RAM were determined and mapped onto subspecies phylogenetic reconstructions as described in the methods using MEGA5. Nodes of the tree where mutations occurred in Parental-MRSA (P-MRSA) isolates from patients prior to exposure to daptomycin or vancomycin treatments [11], [12] and reverted post-drug treatment to an allele also present in a Methicillin-Sensitive isolate (MSSA476) are annotated. A detailed evolutionary history for protein position 221 of the citZ protein in strain A8796 (treated with daptomycin) is provided as a model case. Evolutionary history analysis for each of the identified reversion alleles show that although reversion mutation accumulation biases seem to have occurred in certain strains, reversions to the allele present in a Methicillin-sensitive isolate (MSSA476) has occurred throughout the diversification of the lineage. In the case of the hemL protein, only one protein copy in strain A6300 has acquired the reversion mutation shown. A second hemL copy has acquired a Y?Y?D nonsynonymous mutation (not shown)."
