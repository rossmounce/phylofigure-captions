MARV is grouped phylogenetically with several Brazilian VACV strains isolated during BV outbreaks, but is segregated from VACV vaccine strains.(A) Amino acid inferred sequence of the MARV hemagglutinin (HA) gene and comparison to the homologous sequence from several OPV. The box with an asterisk indicates the deletion region conserved in the sequences of MARV, several Brazilian field VACV samples and the IOC vaccine strain. (B) Phylogenetic tree constructed based on the nucleotide sequence of the OPV ha gene. The ha tree shows MARV grouping with VACV field samples. Despite the presence of the 6 aa deletion, the IOC strain grouped with other vaccine strains. Nucleotide sequences were obtained from GenBank (VACV-ARAV:AY523994; VACV-LOR:DQ810281; VACV-RIA:DQ810280; VACV-CTGV:AF229247; VACV-PSTV:DQ070848; VACV-MURV:DQ247770; VACV-GP2V:DQ206437; VACV-Acambis clone3:AY313848; VACV-DUKE:DQ439815; VACV-MALBRAN:AY146624; VACV-SV2:EF063677; Rabbitpox:AF37511; VACV-LST:AY678276; VACV-SPAn232:DQ222922; VACV-BeAn58058:DQ206442; VACV-GP1V:DQ206436; VACV-WR: AY243312; VACV-Ankara:U944848; VACV-VBH:DQ206435; VACV-Lister-Butantan:EF175985; VACV-IOC:AF225248; VACV-Bfl3906:AF375077; VACV-Bfl81:AF375078; HSPV:DQ792504; MPXV-ZAIRE:DQ011155; MPXV-mpv3945:AF375098; MPXV-Sierra Leone:AY741551; CPXV-Germany: DQ437593; CPXV-cowHA12:AY902253; CPXV-GRI90:AF375087; VARV:DQ437589.
