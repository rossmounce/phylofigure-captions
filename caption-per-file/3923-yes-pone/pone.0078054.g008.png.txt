NF1/Nf1 sequence comparisons.A. Nucleotide sequence alignment using ClustalW2 of squid contigs that were found from this analysis indicate potential gene duplication of NF1/Nf1 in cephalopods. Comp304995_c0_seq1 has best hit with Drosophila Nf1 and comp475299_c0_seq1 with Human NF1. Asterisk(*) indicate sequence identity. B. Phylogenetic tree using Human NF1 and NF2, Drosophila Nf1 and Merlin as well as Nautilus and squid NF1/Nf1 contigs. Note that Nautilus and squid NF1 contigs, and Nautilus and squid Nf1 contigs cluster together. Bar indicates phylogenetic distance."
