Diversification of BCH domains. BCH domains evolved from a CRAL_TRIO like ancestor and diverged into three subgroups with distinct protein domain architectures. This figure displays the predicted path of divergence for each of the three BCH subgroups. Plant and animal BCH subgroups diverged independently. The ‘BCH-only’ subgroups of plants and insects also descended from different ancestors. This is evident from their phylogenetic clustering and their gene-structure. Group-I BCH proteins/genes might have arisen after domain swapping events. Nematodes have only group-III BCH domain proteins, which are associated with a RhoGAP domain. The divergence into three distinct subgroups in the following lineages is therefore the result of either another domain swapping event or an unknown intermediate ancestor."
