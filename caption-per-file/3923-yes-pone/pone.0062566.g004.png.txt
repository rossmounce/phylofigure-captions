"pone.0062566.g004.png","Phylogeny of Clermontia (24 populations spanning 15 apparently non-reticulate species, with two outgroup Cyanea species) based on the combined molecular data.Branch lengths are proportion to inferred genetic changes down each branch. (A) MP phylogram of the single shortest tree; numbers above branches indicate bootstrap support levels ≥ 20%. (B) ML phylogram; numbers above branches indicate bootstrap support levels ≥ 20%. Colored band shows island distribution of populations (see key) and presence (+) vs. absence of petaloid sepals."
