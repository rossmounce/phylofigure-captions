Phylogram of the tick salivary metalloproteases of the reprolysin family. The bootstrapped phylogram (1,000 iterations) was obtained from the alignment of deducted Amblyomma maculatum proteins with homologs found in the non-redundant protein database of the NCBI. The Am. maculatum protein names start with Am- and are recognized by a red circle marker; the remaining proteins are named by the first three letters of the genus name followed by the first three letters of the species name followed by their NCBI gi| accession number. The number at the nodes indicates the bootstrap support, and the bar at the bottom indicates 20% amino acid divergence. Clades and superclades with strong bootstrap support are indicated with Roman numerals."
