Phylogenetic relationships among Ornithodoros species using 16S rRNA sequences (820 seq.).The colored triangles indicate the genetic diversity of the sequences detected for each Ornithodoros species. The colored-spots correspond to the Borrelia species detected in each tick species. The phylogram was constructed using a maximum-likelihood method from partial 16S sequence data (457 nucleotides). Bootstrap values >90 are shown (Scale bar, 0.05 substitutions per site). Ornithodoros moubata (GenBank accession number AB073679), O. porcinus (GenBank acc. no. AB105451), O. turicata (GenBank acc. no. L34327), and O. parkeri (GenBank acc. no. EU009925) were treated as outgroups. Five of these species are newly described: O. occidentalis, O. costalis, O. rupestris, O. kairouanensis, and O. merionesi."
