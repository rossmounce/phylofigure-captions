Phylogenetic relationships of foxtail millet NAC proteins.The sequences were aligned by CLUSTALW at MEGA5 and the unrooted phylogenetic tree was deduced by neighbor-joining method. The proteins were classified into eleven distinct sub-families (SiNAC-I to SiNAC-XI). Each sub-family was assigned a different color according to well-known members in other species."
