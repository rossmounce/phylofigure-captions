"pone.0019673.g004.png","A scenario for intron gains and losses along the bilaterian phylogeny. Phylogenetic tree of the Bilateria species included in this study, consensus drawn from refs. [42], [110], [111], [112], [113], [114], [115]. Intron positions were placed at nodes corresponding to the putative losses (red numbers) or gains (blue numbers), deduced from the phylogenetic distribution of Fig. 1. Alternative possibilities are proposed on Table S3. For clarity of the figure, the repeated losses in Protostomes of the positions shared with Amphioxus (question mark) were not reported. Color code for taxonomical groups is the same as in Fig. 1."
