"pone.0021805.g004.png","Phylogenetic trees for the Brachypodium BdNF-Y families. A) BdNF-YA phylogenetic tree. B) BdNF-YB phylogenetic tree. C) BdNF-YC phylogenetic tree. For each BdNF-Y family, phylogenetic trees were constructed by neighbor-joining as implemented by Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis (MEGA) software, version 4.0 [52]. Reliability values at each branch represent bootstrap samples (10,000 replicates). Note that BdNF-YB16 is orthologous to the DR1-related proteins and these are sometimes shown as a separate, NF-YB-like family [11], [16], [90]. There is no functional data to suggest that either choice is “correct,” but they are more closely related to NF-YB proteins than any other best match in BLAST searches. Thus, they are included here as related, but divergent NF-YB family members."
