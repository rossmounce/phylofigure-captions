"pone.0021364.g001.png","Phylogenetic relationship and conservation of AtBMI1s. (A) Phylogenetic tree based on the full-length sequence of AtBMI1 from Arabidopsis and its human and fly homologs. (B) Tree showing the phylogenetic relationships among RING domain-containing AtBMI1s from Arabidopsis and their human and fly homologs. (C) Primary sequence alignment of the RING domain from AtBMI1 and its human and fly homologs. The GenBank accessions of the sequences are: NM_128610 (At2g30580) for AtBMI1A, NM_202046 (At1g06770) for AtBMI1B, AY099845 (At3g23060) for AtBMI1C from Arabidopsis thaliana, NM_002931 for hRING1, NM_007212 for hRING2 from Homo sapiens, and NM_079001 for Psc from Drosophila melanogaster (dPsc)."
