Subtyping analysis of TB089-89, a BC recombinant strain using jpHMM and manual phylogenetic analysis.A). jpHMM result: A breakpoint is located at position 2598+/−37 (HXB2 numbering). B). Posterior probabilities of the subtypes at each sequence position (original sequence positions) calculated by jpHMM. Posterior probability values are indicated on the y axis and nucleotide positions in the alignment are shown on the x axis. C) and D). Phylogenetic analysis (NJ trees) of two fragments identified by the jpHMM breakpoint. The breakpoint identified the majority of the PR as subtype B (HXB2 nucleotide 2148–2597) and the remaining RT as subtype C (HXB2 nucleotide 2597–3274)."
