Phylogenetic tree of E. coli/Shigella strains and the number of decayed genes. The maximum likelihood tree was constructed by using the concatenated nucleotide sequences of 2500 orthologs conserved in all strains. K12 was used as the reference for identifying pseudogenes in the other strains; EFER was used as the outgroup for constructing the phylogenetic tree."
