Hierarchical clustering of mass spectrometric (A) and phylogenetic fingerprints (B). Distance as 1-Pearson correlation values are indicated on the vertical axes. Subject-wise clustering implies that the proteomic (averaged over the measurements per sample in set of 22 AMP measurements; see Figure S1) and the phylogenetic fingerprints remain characteristic for each subject over a period of one year."
