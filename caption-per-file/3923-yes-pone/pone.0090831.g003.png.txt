Phylogenetic analysis of confirmed pathogens of interests.Sequences were aligned using the MEGA5 (Version5.1) software package. NJ (Neighbor-joining method) phylogenetic tree construction and bootstrap analysis(1000 replicates) were carried out. Bars indicate the percentage of sequence divergence. All positions containing alignment gaps and missing data were deleted (Complete-deletion). A. Phylogenetic tree of bacteria belonging to Rickettsia, inferred from comparison of the partial 16s rDNA gene sequences. B. Phylogenetic tree of bacteria belonging to Coxiella, inferred from comparison of the partial 16s rDNA gene sequences. C. Phylogenetic tree of bacteria belonging to Aspergillus, inferred from comparison of the partial 18s rDNA gene sequences. D. Phylogenetic tree of bacteria belonging to Nidovirales, inferred from comparison of the partial RdRp gene sequences."
