A phylogenetic tree of the putative GH5 proteins from the available metagenomic datasets.The tree was drawn using the Neighbor-Joining method with bootstrap replication of 500. Branches with ? 50% bootstrap support were collapsed. The evolutionary distances were calculated using the p-distance method. Names of proteins (or predicted proteins) were presented by the source organisms and GenBank accession number. The predicted proteins identified in this study are bolded. The GH45 protein of Fibrobacter succinogenes S85 was used as an outgroup. S-1 to S-8 are subfamilies of GH5 proteins."
