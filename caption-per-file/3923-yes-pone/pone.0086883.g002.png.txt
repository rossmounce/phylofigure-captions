"pone.0086883.g002.png","Phylogenetic analysis based on the 549-nucleotide 3Cpro gene of CA24v.All Jiangsu CA24v isolates identified in this study, marked with black triangles, were compared with strains available in GenBank. Strains for which the complete sequences of both the 3Cpro and VP1 regions were available are indicated with **. The MEGA 4.0 software was used for the phylogenetic analysis. The stability of the nodes was assessed using neighbor-joining cluster analysis with 1000 bootstrap replications, and only bootstrap values >70% are shown at the nodes."
