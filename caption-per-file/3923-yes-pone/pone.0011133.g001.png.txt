Phylogenetic tree of primate TAAR3 orthologs analyzed for open reading frames in the present study.The tree is based on generally accepted primate phylogeny as described in [21]. Events causing pseudogenization (nucleotide insertions (ins) or -deletions (del) or stop mutations (stop)) were determined and are labeled on the affected branches in red. Positions stated correspond to codon position of the respective mouse ortholog. Pseudogenes are indicated as ψ and highlighted in red. Detailed information about the sequence changes causing pseudogenization are in Figure S3. dN/dS-ratios (ω) for each branch were calculated by using a “free ratio” model implemented in PAML and are shown in bold below the branches. The number of non-synonymous and synonymous substitutions is given in parentheses. × indicates branches that were labeled to determine ωψ2 (see Table 1, Table S6)."
