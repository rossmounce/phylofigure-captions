"pone.0085140.g004.png","Hydrocarbon composition expressed as a percentage of total hydrocarbons for 32 strains of cyanobacteria displayed by phylogenetic relationship and pathway distribution.Percentages are displayed as mean percentage between three replicates except for those indicated with an asterisk for strains that were characterized using a single sample. Blue strain names indicate strains possessing the FAAR/ADO pathway and red indicates those with the OLS pathway. Purple strain names indicate a strain that does not have a genome sequence and therefore the pathway type is unknown. To the left of the figure, a 16S rRNA phylogenetic tree (Maximum Likelihood, see Figure S2 for complete tree) is presented for all 32 displayed strains. Branch tips are aligned to the corresponding strain names. Branches corresponding to W. intricata HT-29-1, cf. Phormidium sp. ISB 3/Nov/94-8 and Pleurocapsa sp. PCC 7320 are not shown because 16s rRNA sequences are not available for these strains. Vertical connection lengths were modified to accommodate the location of these three strains in the table."
