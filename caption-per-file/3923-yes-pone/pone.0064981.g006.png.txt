Nuclear DNA contents and evolutionary relationships among members of the genus Camellia.The indicated phylogenetic relationships of the genus were constructed by using morphological data and adopted from Min et al. [28]. The numbers in brackets for each section represent the number of species with the measured nuclear DNA content followed by the total number of species comprising the section. The mean 2C DNA amount is indicated by ? for each section, while the range is shown as a line from the minimum to maximum 2C DNA amounts. The two subgenera recognized in Camellia are given on the right side of the figure."
