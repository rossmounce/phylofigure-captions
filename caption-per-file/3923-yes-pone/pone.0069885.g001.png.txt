"pone.0069885.g001.png","Phylogeography of kangaroo apples.A) A longitudinal gradient resulting in 23 crossings. Each of the eight species within the kangaroo apple phylogeny is assigned a unique color, and the two most substantial subclades are labelled. B) A latitudinal gradient results in 57 crossings. C) Results of a linear axes analysis on the kangaroo apple dataset. The number of crossings is only shown for axes between 90? and 270? as the graph has a period of 180?. Under the null model, only 10 of 10,000 permutations resulted in fewer than 34 crossings which is depicted by the red line (i.e. ??=?0.001). D) A linear axes analysis of the Similia subclade with the red line set to reflect a conservative critical value of ??=?0.1. E) A linear axes analysis of the Avicularia/Laciniata subclades (??=?0.1)."
