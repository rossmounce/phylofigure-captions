Tree inferred with the Arb-sina aligned complete dataset under a GTRÎ“ model.Bootstrap values (n = 1000) are indicated at the nodes. Red arrows indicate how a taxon or clade differs in the other regularly coded trees, with values in square brackets indicating in how many trees this is seen. If there are one or more differences within a family, this is indicated after the name of the family. The leaves of the phylogram are collapsed into taxonomic families and into the host phyla for mitochondria. The internal topology of the Rhodospirillales order is not the same in all primary trees, therefore it has been expanded to show all leaves (inset)."
