Phylogenetic analyses of insect carboxylesterases (CarEs).MEGA 5 was used to construct the phylogenetic tree with neighbor-joining method. Nodes with distance bootstrap values greater than 50% (1000 replicates) are shown. The nomenclatures of the clades are according to Oakeshott et al. [4]. Sequences from the D. melanogaster and A. gambiae genomes are annotated as in Ranson et al. [71].The 39 deduced CarEs from L. migratoria are marked with filled circles. The GenBank accession numbers for various CarEs of insects used in this tree were generally taken from NCBI database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/). The tree included twelve clades named A-N (except for C and J clade). The abbreviations used for insect species are: Drosophila melanogaster (Dm), Anopheles gambiae (Ag), Culex quinquefasciatus (Cq), Aedes aegypti (Aa), Lucilia cuprina (Lc), Haematobia irritans (Hi), Musca domestica (Md), Myzus persicae (Mp), Antheraea polyphemus (Ap), Manduca sexta (Ms), Choristoneura fumiferana (Cf), Bombyx mori (Bm), and Tribolium castaneum (Tc)."
