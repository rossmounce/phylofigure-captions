Phylogenetic analysis of the fiber coding sequence in HAdV-D58. Analysis of HAdV-D58 is based on the nucleic acid sequence of the fiber knob. Phylogenetic trees were constructed from aligned sequences using MEGA, via the neighbor-joining methods and a bootstrap test of phylogeny. Bootstrap values shown at the branching points indicate the percentages of 1000 replications produced the clade."
