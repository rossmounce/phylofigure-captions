A maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree of HIV-1 env gp 120 V1-C5 sequences from 29 subjects infected with HIV-1 subtype A is presented.(Note that 13 DNA sequences classified as pure subtype A1 from subject 322 were also included in this analysis, resulting in a total of 29 subjects). Subject 20 was infected with two distinct unrelated variants of HIV-1 subtype A1 which are shown in red. Subject 168 infected with two closely related variants of subtype A1 which are shown in light blue and highlighter plot. The DNA sequences of subject 87 shown in blue clustered with the DNA sequences of subject 322 shown in purple with the aLRT support value of 1.0. Methodological details have been described in the legend to Figure 1. Scale at the bottom of the Figure corresponds to 0.01 nucleotide substitutions per site."
