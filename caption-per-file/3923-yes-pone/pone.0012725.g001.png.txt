Phylogenetic distribution of LRR domain containing proteins.Species tree showing the numbers of LRR-domain (L) and LRR-receptor (LR) encoding genes in the genomes of representative species from each of the taxonomic groups studied. Broad phylogenetic groups are indicated by coloured bars (A =  Amoebozoa, R = Rhodphyta, H = Haptophyte). The tree is schematic and is based on Burki et al., [35]."
