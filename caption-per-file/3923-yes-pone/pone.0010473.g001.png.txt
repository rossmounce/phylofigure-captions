Phylogenetic relationships within the long branch clade in Annonaceae.a) Phylogram of the majority rule consensus tree of the last 30,000 trees sampled after five million generations of the MCMCMC run indicating the branch lengths as well as the two major groups recognized within the Annonaceae: long branch and short branch clade. b) Majority rule consensus tree of the last 30,000 trees sampled after five million generations of the MCMCMC run. Posterior probabilities under 0.95 are displayed at nodes. Thick branches indicate support >0.95 PP. The distribution of species with compound pollen (1, black squares) and syncarpy (2, black squares) are represented along the tips of the phylogeny. Missing squares indicate absent observations; the species was scored as uncertain for that character."
