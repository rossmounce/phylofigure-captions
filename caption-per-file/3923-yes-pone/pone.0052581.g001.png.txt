"pone.0052581.g001.png","PPI presence and absence at the different nodes in the rooted eutherian phylogenetic tree. A)At each node, we have shown the predicted percentage of human PPIs present at that node (necessarily 100% at the human tip). The percentages at the other seven tip nodes were inferred by the presence or absence of the orthologs of the two human proteins making up the PPI (Methods). We then inferred the states of the internal nodes under the assumption that a given PPI ortholog pair could appear only once in the phylogeny (Methods). The topology was visualized using FigTree [61]. Branch lengths are the mean Ks value (e.g., number of synonymous substitutions per synonymous site) found across the genes surveyed for that branch of the tree (See Methods). The five colored branches indicate potential origin points for a PPI under our limited parsimony model (Methods), while the two gray branches were used to estimate the rate of PPI loss. The dashed branches indicate the fact the Ks values could not be distinguished for these two branches because the models used produce unrooted trees. B) There is an association between the age of the branch along which a PPI appears (x-axis; estimated via Ks above) and the average interaction degree of the proteins that make up that interaction (y-axis). Note that the blue distance was estimated as one-half the Ks distance between the rodent-primate and horse-dog-cow clade in the unrooted topology of (A). See Methods for details."
