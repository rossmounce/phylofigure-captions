"pone.0024461.g001.png","Representation of the likely emergence of Î±4 amino acid substitutions encoded by ITGA4 exons 5 and 6 across neotropical primate radiation. The consensus amino acid sequence of the Platyrrhini group was used as the ancestral root of the tree, and residue replacements refer to that sequence. Each replacement had its emergence estimated and placed into the most updated Platyrrhini phylogeny according to Perelman et al. [29]."
