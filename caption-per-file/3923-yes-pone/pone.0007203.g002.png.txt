Phylogeny of Neoconocephalus based on nuclear genes.Bayesian phylogeny of Neoconocephalus using partial nDNA sequences H3 (a) and ITS (b). Nodal support values given as posterior probabilities in percent; asterisk indicate 100%. The temperate clade and the N. maxillosus clade are indicated by labels ‘T’ and ‘M’, respectively. Branch lengths drawn to scale. The taxa included in these phylogenies are listed in Table S1. Asterisks at the species names indicates temperate life history.
