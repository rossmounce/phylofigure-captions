Neighbor-joining tree showing the phylogenetic relationships of the C. sinensis isolates included in this study (n?=?256).All isolates were delineated into three major groups: the cluster A (n?=?225) complex, cluster B (n?=?19) and cluster C (n?=?12). Geographically unique clusters were detected within the dendrogram tree: Henan (purple), Guangxi (green), Guangdong (blue) and Shandong (red). Isolates collected from fish and dogs are marked with symbols for fish and dog. The percentages of replicate trees in which the associated taxa clustered together in the bootstrap test (1000 replications) are indicated. The evolutionary distances were computed using the Maximum Composite Likelihood method and are presented in units of the number of base substitutions per site."
