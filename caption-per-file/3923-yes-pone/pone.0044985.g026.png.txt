"pone.0044985.g026.png","Strict consensus of 22 most parsimonious cladograms, showing the phylogenetic relationships of Plesiosuchus manselii and Dakosaurus maximus within Metriorhynchidae when all characters are unordered.Note that while both are members of the subclade Geosaurini, P. manselii is in an unresolved position with Torvoneustes, Geosaurus and Dakosaurus (D. andiniensis D. maximus). Length = 627; ensemble consistency index, CI = 0. 506; ensemble retention index, RI = 0. 860; rescaled consistency index, RC = 0. 435. The black arrow points to the only consistent difference in the 50% majority rule consensus topology: the slightly greater resolution in Rhacheosaurini. Bootstrap-values are given above or below the relevant node."
