Unrooted phylogeny of RNAP2 based on Bayesian analysis of 80 sequences of 272 amino acid positions performed with PhyloBayes under the CAT60 model. Detailed parameters are given in the Materials and Methods section. Assuming that the root of the tree lies outside the viruses and eukaryotes, the NCLDV sequences (red) are not monophyletic but form three groups, one branch located between the archaeal (green) and the eukaryotic (blue) sequences, one branch emerging from within the eukaryotes, and one branch comprising the Emiliana huxleyi virus. Bacterial sequences are shown in purple, and metagenomic sequences of unknown organismal origin are shown in black. Branch support shown represents posterior probabilities, bar represents 0.3 substitutions per site."
