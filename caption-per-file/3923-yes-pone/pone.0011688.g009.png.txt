"pone.0011688.g009.png","Identified domains and phylogenetic analysis of PGR7.A) Possible functional domains identified through Hidden Markov Model (HMM) construction and the positions of the FMN-binding split barrel domain and the DUF2470 domain in PGR7. B) Maximum likelihood phylogenetic analysis of PGR7 homologs in selected plants and green algae. A conserved region of PGR7 (residues 58-263) was used to identify 160 global homologs from plants, green algae, and bacteria in the UniProt database. The sequences were aligned, and a phylogenetic tree was generated with midpoint rooting. A branch of the larger tree (see Figure S1) that contains the plant and green algal sequences (with UniProt accession numbers) is shown here. The numbers at the nodes are bootstrap values from 100 runs."
