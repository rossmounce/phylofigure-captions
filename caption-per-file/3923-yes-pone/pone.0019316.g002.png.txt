"pone.0019316.g002.png","Protein phylogeny and independent character analysis of translated amino acid sequences of cooS genes. Protein phylogeny was determined by Phylip ProML maximum-likelihood analysis of 379 unambiguously aligned and filtered amino acid positions. Support for the tree was calculated by 100 bootstrap-step reanalysis of the dataset using protein maximum-likelihood methods and is reported for nodes with greater than 50% support. Gray boxes (labeled A, B, and C) indicate the major clades of CooS sequences determined in this study along with related representatives from described microbial isolates. Clade designations are defined by 100% bootstrap support and branch-length separation from other CooS sequences. Bold labels are CODH enzymes that have been biochemically or structurally characterized. Dots indicate CooS sequences from species shown to be CO2-reductive acetogens [4]. For species having more than one CODH, the number of the CODH out of the total is given parenthetically. *The sequence of CODH-III of C. hydrogenoformans contains a reading frame shift; the approximate phylogenetic position of its corrected amino acid sequence is given by the dashed line. Bar indicates distance given as 0.1 changes per amino acid position. Side bars indicate the results of independent character analysis of insertion/deletion (indel) sequences in each of the CODH proteins. Indel 1: sequences indicated by the gray bar contain the amino acid sequences TEIFD/NGH corresponding to position 306–312 in T. azotonutricium and T. primitia str. ZAS-1. Indel 2: sequences indicated by the gray bar contain the amino acid sequences A/TNS/THVD corresponding to position 409–414 in T. azotonutricium or 399–404 in T. primitia str. ZAS-1 and T. primitia str. ZAS-2."
