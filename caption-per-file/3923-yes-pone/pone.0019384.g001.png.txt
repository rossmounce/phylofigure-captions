Analyses of secretin receptor phylogeny and in silico genomic locations. (A) Receptor phylogeny: phylogenetic analysis of vertebrate receptors in Class II B1 GPCR. The tree was generated by Maximum Likelihood (ML) and plotted by MEGA 5.0. Receptors cloned in the present study are marked by an asterisk. Diverged from the ancestral VPAC-like receptor (denoted by a black dot), the P. dolloi SCTR retained the VIP/PACAP functions (branch in dotted line); whereas the X. laevis and mammalian SCTRs acquired the specificity towards secretin (branch in thick solid black line). PTHR, parathyroid hormone receptor; SCTR, secretin receptor; PAC1, pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) receptor type I; VPAC1, vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)-PACAP receptor I; VPAC2, VIP-PACAP receptor II. (B) Chromosomal locations of secretin receptor in various vertebrate species. Genes adjacent to secretin receptor in different vertebrate genomes are shown. Homologous genes present in different species are linked to show their similarities in chromosomal location."
