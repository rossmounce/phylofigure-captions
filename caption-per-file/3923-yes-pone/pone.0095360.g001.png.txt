"pone.0095360.g001.png","ML phylogenetic tree of HIV-1 subtype B pol (∼1000 pb) sequences circulating in Panama (n = 761), and representative sequences of the BPANDEMIC (US = 465, France = 344) and the BCAR (Caribbean = 238) clades.Branches are colored according to the geographic origin of each sequence, as indicated at the legend (top left). Red shaded boxes highlight the position of the twelve major Panamanian HIV-1 subtype B clades (BPA-I to BPA-XII). The number of sequences and the aLRT support values for each clade are indicated at bottom. Asterisk indicates the node of the BPANDEMIC clade. The tree was rooted using HIV-1 subtype D reference sequences. The branch lengths are drawn to scale with the bar at the bottom indicating nucleotide substitutions per site."
