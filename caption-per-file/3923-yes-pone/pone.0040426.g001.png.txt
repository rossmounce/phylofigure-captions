Phylogenetic tree showing the relationship of the putative C. elegans PDAs to previously characterized peptidoglycan or chitin deacetylases from bacteria, fungi and insects.A ClustalW alignment of residues predicted to encode the polysaccharide deacetylase domain of each protein was used to generate a phylogenetic tree by applying the minimum evolution method using the tree-drawing software Mega 4.0 (Kumar et al., 2004). A bootstrap consensus tree based on 5000 replicates is depicted and bootstrapping values are shown. C54G7.3 and F48E3.8 are two predicted homologs in C. elegans and are related to distinct homologs in three other species from the genus Caenorhabditis. Other sequences are from the filarial parasitic nematodes Brugia malayi and Loa loa and from the non-filarial parasitic nematodes Ascaris suum and Trichinella spiralis. A homologous sequence derived from the B. malayi bacterial endosymbiont Wolbachia sp. TRS (WolBm0147) is also included along with sequences from the bacterium Streptococcus pneumoniae, the protists Entamoeba histolytica and Entamoeba invadens, the fungus Cryptococcus neoformans, and the insects Drosophila melanogaster and Tribolium castaneum."
