"pone.0049989.g001.png","WGST phylogeny of outbreak and background Apophysomyces isolates.A single maximum parsimony tree was reconstructed using âˆ¼28K SNPs from 22 whole genome sequences, resulting in a CI of 0.62. The tree was rooted with Apo-7449 (A. variabilis). The root was derived from an expanded phylogenetic analyses that included a distant outgroup, which enabled the identification of the most basal member of the samples in the dataset described in this figure (data not shown). Genomes are labeled with a Strain ID # (APO-XXXX) and a Cluster ID #-Letter (CX-A). Clusters of identical and nearly identical genome SNP profiles are also labeled. Branch lengths represent genetic distance based on the number of SNP differences; bar represents 1000 SNPs. Tree constructed using MEGA5."
