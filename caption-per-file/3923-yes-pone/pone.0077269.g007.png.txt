Comparative summary of citharinoid phylogenies inferred with and without putatively saturated sequence data.Parsimony and model-based phylogenies based on the original dataset (top) and a restricted dataset with nd2 sequence data removed (bottom). Branches are differentially colored by generic/suprageneric subclade, of which the composition is indicated by the genus/genera matching the color of its branches."
