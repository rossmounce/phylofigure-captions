Fig. 4aPlasmodium phylogenetic tree with bootstrap values (>50%) displayed. Nodal support values from maximum likelihood analysis are displayed above branches and those from Bayesian analysis are below. Letters identify the clade (n = 9) with clade infection prevalence in brackets (n = 218). Samples are labelled by host latin name - number infected. GenBank strains are labelled by accession number (lineage code) – host latin name and location sampled. Avian families are represented by the following symbols: ▴Ploceidae; •Sylviidae; ▸Muscicapidae; ▪Zosteropidae; ΔPasseridae; ♣Motacillidae; ○Laniidae; *Estrildidae; ♦Cisticolidae; ◊Hirundinidae; ⁃Promeropidae; □Nectariniidae. Other samples are species from uninfected or unrepresented families, or are samples of undefined origin. Fig. 4b. Haemoproteus phylogenetic tree with bootstrap values (>50%) displayed. Figures from maximum likelihood analysis are displayed above branches, whilst figures from Bayesian analysis are below. Coding for avian families is as for Fig. IVa (clades = 7). Blocks emphasize apparent patterns of lineage separation by host family group (n = 7)."
