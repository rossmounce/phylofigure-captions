Human population phylogeny and relationship between ACTN3 577XX frequency and latitude.A, The Bayesian posterior consensus tree for the human populations used in this study (inferred from whole mitochondrial sequences). The numbers on the branches indicate the proportion of trees in the posterior distribution that contain a given clade. Branch lengths are in the number of changes per site. B, The relationship between ACTN3 577XX genotype frequency and latitude. The generalized linear mixed model that accounts for both phylogenetic relatedness and migration is arcsin(ACTN3XX)?=?0.035?0.003 *Latitude (p-value for slope?=?0.06)."
