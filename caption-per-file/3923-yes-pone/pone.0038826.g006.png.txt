"pone.0038826.g006.png","Consensus, unrooted tree obtained by Bayesian estimates of phylogenies for the amino acid and nucleotide sequences, as well as for a protein parsimony approach.All clades showed a statistical support of 1 (=100%) with reference to the six independent trees computed (Bayesian estimate). The same holds for the statistical support with reference to the 1,000 replicas fed into the protpars program (protein parsimony). The branch length in this tree is arbitrary. The only difference between these is a weaker support in one of the clades (50% support, as indicated by the red star). Note that all phylogenetic approaches resulted in the same tree. Red entries indicate algae channels, while blue entries are viral channels."
