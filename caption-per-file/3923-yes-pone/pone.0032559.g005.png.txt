"pone.0032559.g005.png","Phylogenetic relationship of selected ant and insect species. The phylogenetic relationship of the ant species (Formicidae) used for this study (Atta cephalotes, Camponotus floridanus and Harpegnathos saltator; shown as grey box) is indicated as a phylogram tree (adapted and modified from [16], [66]) in comparison to two Hymenoptera species Apis mellifera (honeybee) and Nasonia vitripennis (parasitoid wasp), the Coleoptera species Tribolium castaneum (red flour beetle), the Nematocera species Anopheles gambiae (mosquitoes), the Brachycera species Drosophila melanogaster (fruit fly) and human as representative vertebra species (Homo sapiens). The absence of the oxytocin/vasopressin peptide hormone system in a specific lineage is indicated with an X."
