Consensus Bayesian phylogeny of the Daphnia pulex species complex based on the mitochondrial ND5 and COX1 genes.The alignment contains 95 sequences consisting of 762 nt of ND5 and 1386 nt of COX1 with 321 polymorphic positions of which 204 are phylogenetically informative. The tree is rooted through the midpoint. Posterior probabilities are indicated on the nodes of the tree and are not shown if less than 0.80. Taxon colors represent geographic locations as follows: black = North America, blue = east Asia, red = South America."
