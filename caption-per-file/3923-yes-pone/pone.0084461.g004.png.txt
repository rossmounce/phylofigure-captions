"pone.0084461.g004.png","Phylogenetic tree of the P. cochleariae sequences and homologous sequences derived from the tree of life calculated using RAxML.Highlighted sequences regard to P. cochleariae and most similar sequences. Especially the green branch has to be subdivided into various subbranches, presenting all homologous sequences belonging to Metazoa. The tree significantly shows that the sugars (glucose) and trehalose transporters build up a huge tree in insects. Figure S5 shows the phylogeny of the selected organisms from the tree of life."
