Comparison of the B. methanolicus Mdhs and the K. pneumoniae 1,3-PDH (DhaTKp).The MGA3 Mdhs are denoted MdhM, Mdh2M, and Mdh3M; the PB1 Mdhs are denoted MdhP, Mdh1P, and Mdh2P, while the C1 Mdh is denoted MdhC1. (A) Primary sequence alignments show a conserved GGGSX2DX2K motif involved in NAD+ binding (underlined) and residues assumed to be involved in metal ion binding (bold and highlighted). Residues in bold are unique for type III Adhs [12]. (B) Relationship among the primary protein sequences of the B. methanolicus MGA3, PB1 and C1 Mdhs and the K. pneumoniae 1,3-PDH, represented by a phylogenetic tree."
