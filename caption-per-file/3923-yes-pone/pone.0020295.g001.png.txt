"pone.0020295.g001.png","Phylogenetic relationships among o-methyltransferase orthologs. 212 identified orthologs of Francisella tularensis subsp. tularensis o-methyltransferase. Phylogenetic trees were constructed with protein sequences using the Maximum Likelihood method. Bootstrap values were calculated after 1000 replicates, and the consensus tree is shown. Values of branches clustering select species are shown above the branch and frequencies are proximal to nodes of interest. Francisella o-methyltransferase subtypes phylogenetically cluster with orthologs identified in species of environmental and coastal bacteria (e.g Marnimonas genus). A neighboring cluster shows a tight clustering between the Coxiella and Human, Mouse and Rat o-methyltransferase orthologs."
