Identification of M. brassicae PTTH (MabPTTH).(A) Amino-acid sequence of MabPTTH precursor peptide. The dotted and straight underlines represent the predicted signal peptide and the PTTH monomer peptide, respectively. A predicted cleavage site is shown in blue letters. The seven cysteine residues conserved among the PTTHs are shown in red. The amino acid residues shown in shaded letters are conserved between the M. Brassicae and H. armigera PTTHs. (B) A phylogenetic tree showing the relationships between the PTTH precursors. The tree was generated using the ClustalW program (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/clustalw/). The shaded area denotes the Noctuidae family, and the red box shows MabPTTH precursor. The scale bar indicates an evolutionary distance of 0.1 amino acid substitutions per position. The numbers on the branches denote bootstrap values per 1000 replications. (C) Whole-mount in situ hybridization analysis on a day-0 ND pupal brain with the antisense probe for the MabPTTH transcript. (D) Whole-mount immunohistochemistry on a day-0 sixth instar larval brain (Br)-corpora cardiaca-corpora allata (CA) complex with an anti-MabPTTH mouse monoclonal antibody. The black and white arrows indicate the cell bodies of PTTH-producing neurons. Note that these neurons project their axons to the CA. Scale bars, 100 ?m."
