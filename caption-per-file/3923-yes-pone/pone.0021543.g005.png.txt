Hypothetical phylogenic tree with an Ancestral Sequence still present in the population. Mutation events are in red, the green star is the MRCA lineage. Present haplotypes are shown as triangles. The green triangle is the Living Fossil Sequence with no mutation event on this lineage since MRCA. Db is the phylogenic distance between the AS and MRCA of the superlineage. Da is the phylogenic distance between AS and the present related haplotype. Phylogenetic distance is the average number of synonymous mutations accumulated between individuals."
