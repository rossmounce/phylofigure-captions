Evolutionary relationships of arrA sequences.A total of 47 nucleotide sequences and 242 sites were analyzed. The phylogeny was reconstructed by maximum likelihoodand GTR+I+G+F was selected as best fit model. Support values for each node were estimated using the Akaike Likelihood Ratio Test (aLRT). Only support values higher than 70% are shown. Reference sequences retrieved from the non-redundant database of the NCBI are shown in black, bacterial isolates (MS-AsIII and MS-AsV) in green, and operational taxonomic unities (OTUs) from As gene clone libraries in blue. Different background colors highlight three bacterial phyla - Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Chrysiogenetes."
