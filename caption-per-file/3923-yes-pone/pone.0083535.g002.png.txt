Sliding-window plots along the FAE1 gene regions and fixed mutations between Clade I & II. (a) Diversity of the FAE1 gene at silent sites. Windows include 25 silent sites, with successive displacements of 10 sites. The black boxes represent 7 conserved motifs, marked with corresponding ID. (b) 16 fixed mutations between Clade I & II in phylogeny tree of Brassicaceae FAE1. The consensus sequences of each conserved motif are shown with the simplified topology of phylogeny tree of Brassicaceae FAE1 drafted in left. Blue characters in motifs indicate the fixed mutations and the variations of the fixed sites are listed corresponding to each clade in phylogeny tree."
