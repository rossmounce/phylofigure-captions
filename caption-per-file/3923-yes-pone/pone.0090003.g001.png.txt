Organization of the P/V/C gene of Paramyxovirinae and phylogeny of the C proteins.A. Organization of the P/V/C gene transcription unit of Paramyxovirinae. PNT: N-terminal moiety of P; PCT: C-terminal moiety of P. The V protein is composed of PNT fused, by co-transcriptional editing (arrow) of the P mRNA, to a zinc finger domain encoded in a different frame. For clarity, only the C-terminal zinc finger of V is shown. B. Clustering of Paramyxovirinae C proteins by sequence similarity. The cladograms represent the measles, Nipah and Sendai groups."
