"pone.0060416.g003.png","Phylogenetic tree of HRSV-B strains.The phylogenetic tree was constructed based on a 708?762-nucleotide fragment of the G protein, consisting of the two hypervariable regions. The nucleotide sequences of the Belgian strains isolated during 5 consecutive epidemic seasons (2006?2011) were compared with reference strains from Buenos Aires (BA), Belgium (BE) and South Africa (SA). The outgroup is represented by the WV/B1/85 strain. Bootstrap values are indicated at the internal nodes and are calculated for 1000 replicates by the neighbour joining method. Only bootstrap values >70 are shown. The numbers between brackets are the number of sequences identical to the sequence shown in the tree. The amino acid lengths predicted for the G protein are indicated next to the Belgian isolates. The isolates with no predicted G protein length indicated consisted of 310 residues."
