Bayesian phylogenetic tree of 124 DENV2 complete genomes.A-The tree shows the eleven Brazilian viruses sequenced in this study (two-color highlighted cluster at the top) and globally sampled DENV2 genomes. Blue branches represent Brazilian viruses sampled in previous epidemics. Posterior probability of all key nodes is depicted. B- Clusters of viruses sequenced during this study. The blue bar in the branch leading to clade 2 represents the amino acid change at position T180I in envelope gene."
