Phylogenetic tree of amino acid sequences (A) p-nitrophenol 4-monooxygenase (PnpM), Benzenetriol dioxygenase (BtD) from stain SJ98 was taken as outgroup for the phylogenetic tree for PNP monooxygenases and (B) p-benzoquinone reductase (BqR), nitrite reductase from E. coli was taken as an outgroup to create the phylogenetic tree for the benzoquinone reductases.Neighbor joining method was applied at the bootstrap value of 1000. Accession number of the proteins is written in parentheses."
