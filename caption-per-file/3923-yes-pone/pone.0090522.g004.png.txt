"pone.0090522.g004.png","Phylogenetic tree (A) and population structure (B) of the TRAP gene of 110 P. falciparum isolates from three geographic regions.Samples included 32 isolates from Ratchaburi Province, Thailand (investigated in this study), 29 from Tak Province, Thailand, and 49 from Gambia. A, The phylogenetic tree of the TRAP sequences was constructed using the neighbor-joining method. B, Membership coefficients from STRUCTURE analysis (K?=?3) were plotted for 110 isolates. Each isolate is represented by a vertical bar displaying the proportion of membership in each of the three hypothetical clusters."
