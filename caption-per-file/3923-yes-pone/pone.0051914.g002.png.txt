"pone.0051914.g002.png","Phylogenetic trees based on the partial sequences of 16S rRNA, p66 and glpQ genes.The Maximum Likelihood model was used for phylogenetic tree reconstruction of the partial A) 16S rRNA (1106 bp), B) p66 (349 bp and 355 bp for ?I. persulcatus?-type and ?I. ricinus?-type, respectively) and C) glpQ genes (379 bp). Only quartet puzzling support values >70% are shown. Samples sequenced in the present study are underlined."
