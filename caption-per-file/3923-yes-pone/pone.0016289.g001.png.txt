Maximum a-posteriori (MAP) phylogeny and alignment of the Solenopsis invicta (SiOBP) odorant binding proteins. A. The S. invicta MAP phylogeny. The branch in grey is collapsed in the 50% consensus tree. Branch support is posterior probabilities derived from 3241 samples taken after the burn-in was discarded. Even though the node support in the conserved ortholog clade is relatively poor, the exact same topology of the orthologs was recovered in the honey bee MAP tree (not shown), suggesting that the branching pattern is accurate. B. The S. invicta MAP-AU plot. The quality of the alignment is indicated through a heat map. Red (warm colors) indicates areas of high quality alignment, blue (cold colors) signifies areas of low certainty. Note that there are considerable high quality alignment blocks in the N-terminal signal peptide and the C-terminal protein tail."
