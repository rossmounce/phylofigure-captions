"pone.0063380.g001.png","Phylogenetic trees of full-length TSWV isolates and RNA segments.(a) A phylogenetic tree of the 13 Korean TSWV isolates, including 10 that were newly sequenced in this study and three that were previously reported [26]. The phylogenetic tree was constructed by the neighbor-joining (NJ) method and Kimura 2-parameter method with bootstrap resampling (1000 replications) using the whole-nucleotide sequences by combining RNA L, RNA M, and RNA S sequences. (b) A phylogenetic tree of 17 full-length TSWV RNA L segments. L1 and L2 were from Brazil whereas L3 and L4 were from the USA and China. Note that in (b?d), the country where each TSWV isolate/segment was collected is indicated by different-colored fonts. (c) A phylogenetic tree of 57 full-length TSWV RNA M segments. M1 was from Australia, M2 and M3 were from Brazil, M4 and M5 were from China, M6 and M7 were from Italy, M8 was from Korea, M9 to M29 were from Spain, and M30 to M44 were from the USA. The remaining 13 isolates were from Korea. (d) A phylogenetic tree of 53 full-length TSWV RNA S segments. S1?S3 were from Brazil; S4?S6 were from China; S7?S20 were from Italy; S21?S23 were from Japan, the Netherlands, and Korea, respectively; S24?S26 were from Spain, and S27?S40 were from the USA. The remaining 13 isolates were from Korea. Detailed information for each TSWV isolate is also provided in Table 1 and Table S1. The number at each branch of each phylogenetic tree represents the bootstrap value (1000 replicates). The different background colors indicate the different clusters of TSWV isolates."
