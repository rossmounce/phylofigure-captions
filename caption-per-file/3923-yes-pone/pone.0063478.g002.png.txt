"pone.0063478.g002.png","Comparison of phylogenies between neutral and symbiotic markers in beta-rhizobia.The neutral marker phylogeny (A) is based on a partition of 800 bp of 16 S rDNA and 600 bp of recA genes, and was built by a Bayesian analysis with priors estimated by ML (see Experimental procedure section). Numbers at ach nodes indicates posterior probabilities (upper number) and bootstraps values % (lower number) from a ML analyses built in parallel (with a GTR+I+G model, 1000 bootstrap replicates). Bootstraps are only indicated when >50%. Node values in bold indicates supported nodes (both by posterior probabilities and bootstrap) retained for clades delineation. The nodC phylogeny is based on 437 bp alignments, and was built by ML using a GTR+I+G model, with 1000 bootstraps replicates (% indicated at tree nodes if >50%). Abbreviations used: B.: Burkholderia, C.: Cupriavidus, BPL: Burkholderia phenoliruptrix, BT: B. tuberum, BSa: B. sabiae, BD: B. diazotrophica, BSy: B. symbiotica, BM: B. mimosarum, BN: B. nodosa, BSP1,2,3,4: Burkholderia sp. 1 to 4, T indicates species type strains. Accession numbers are listed in Table S3."
