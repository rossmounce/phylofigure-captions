"pone.0022252.g003.png","Tanglegram for the Narnaviridae and their hosts. The parasite supermatrix was constructed using RASCAL and GBLOCKS alignment filtering, and the ‘theory’ host distances were used. All links were insignificant according to the ParaFit test, which also accepted the global null hypothesis of no correspondence between host and Narnaviridae phylogenies. The numbers on the branches within the parasite tree are maximum-likelihood bootstrap values ≥60%. Host branches are coloured according to their deep taxonomic affiliations: blue, Fungi (light blue, Ascomycota; dark blue, Basidiomycota); green, Viridiplantae."
