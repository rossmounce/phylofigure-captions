"pone.0051031.g002.png","Unrooted neighbour-joining phylogenetic tree based on the 5â€²UTR sequence among pestiviruses.The strains detected in six chamois (ARAN-9, -10, -11.-12, -13, and -14) showed genetic identity and subsequently the analysis was performed only with one sequence (ARAN-9). The detected strains cluster with other chamois viruses isolated in the bordering NHR of Alt Pallars-Aran (ARAN-1, and -2). The numbers on the branches indicate the bootstrap values (in percentage; 1,000 replicates). Sequences of strains were taken from Gen Bank with following accession numbers: ARAN-9 (HE818617), ARAN-10 (HE818618), Aran-11 (HE818619), ARAN-12 (HE818620), ARAN-13 (HE818621), ARAN-14 (HE818622), ARAN-1 (AM765800), ARAN-2 (AM765801), Chamois-Spain02 (AY641529), FRESER 2 (FN691777), ORLUR36 (DQ898294), CERDANYA-2 (AM905931), CERDANYA-1 (AM905930), CADI-6 (AM905923), CADI-1 (AM905918), BU1-C3 (DQ361068), Espana-97 -1 (FR714860), AV (EF693984), 137/4 (U65052), Moredun (U65023), CASIMIR (AB122085), BVDV NADL (M31182). The sequence of strain FRESER-1 is not deposited in the GenBank. The scale bar represents 0.05 substitutions per nucleotide site."
