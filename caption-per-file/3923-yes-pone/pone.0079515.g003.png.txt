Phylogenetic placement of the yeast isolates associated with Doubledaya bucculenta.(A) A neighbor-joining phylogeny inferred from DNA sequences of D1/D2 domain of 26S rRNA gene (530 bps). (B) A neighbor-joining phylogeny inferred from DNA sequences of EF-1Î± gene (709 bps). (C) A neighbor-joining phylogeny inferred from DNA sequences of ITS/5.8S rRNA gene (360 bps). Bootstrap values (1000 replicates) of 50% or higher are shown at the nodes. Sequence accession numbers are shown in brackets. Yeast isolates obtained from D. bucculenta and Pleioblastus simonii in this study are discriminated by sites of eggs and P. simonii internodes where the isolate was obtained, the number to specify an egg and the internode harboring the egg, and the localities where the isolates were sampled. Abbreviations: AE, the anterior end of an egg; LS, the lateral side of an egg; PE, the posterior end of an egg; OH, the edge of the inner opening of an oviposition hole. aMiyazaki Prefecture, Japan; bIbaraki Prefecture, Japan; ca yeast isolate with colony texture different from Wickerhamomyces anomalus, which was obtained at the inner opening of an oviposition hole."
