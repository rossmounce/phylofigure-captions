"pone.0062562.g004.png","A–B. Phylogenetic reconstruction and sequence analysis of tryptogalinin and functionally described Kunitz from the literature.A phylogram (A) of tryptogalinin and other functionally described Kunitz peptides from hematophagous arthropods, nematodes and platyhelminthes was constructed using maximum likelihod (ML) methods. The first four letters for each label displays the taxa name followed by the GenBank accession number and the functional nomenclature from the literature. The presented ML tree was rooted with Hg1, a trypsin and potassium channel inhibitor of the Mexican scorpion Hadrurus gertschi (GenBank: P0C8W3). Bootstrap values (≥50%) are indicated in the phylogram and the scale bar (mean amino acid substitution/site) is presented at the bottom left corner. A sequence alignment (B) of tryptogalinin and TdPI of Rhipicephalus appendiculatus from clade IV. Identical (black) and similar sequence regions (grey), the positions of the conserved Cys residues (roman numerals and brackets), and the Cys-Lys-Ala sequence (box) that form the Kunitz head (P1) interacting with the active site of serine proteases are marked. The signal peptide for tryptogalinin is highlighted in yellow."
