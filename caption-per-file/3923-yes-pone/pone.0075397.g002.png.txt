Maximum parsimony tree of haplogroup M5 Romani mitogenomes.The inset map shows the geographic location and sample size of all the M5 genomes observed in India subcontinent. The position of the revised Cambridge reference sequence (rCRS) is indicated for reading sequence motifs [52]. Mitochondrial DNA variants are indicated along the branches of the phylogenetic tree. An asterisk (*) as prefix indicates a position located in an overlapping region shared by two mtDNA genes. Mutations are transitions unless a suffix A, C, G, or T indicates a transversion. Other possible suffixes indicate insertions (+), synonymous substitution (s), mutational changes in tRNA (-t), mutational change in rRNA (-r), non-coding variant located in the mtDNA coding region (-nc) and an amino acid replacement (indicated in round brackets). Variants underlined represent recurrent mutations in this tree while a prefix ?@? indicates a back mutation. Mutational hotspot variants at positions 16182, 16183, and 16519, as well as variation around position 310 and length or point heteroplasmies were not considered for the phylogenetic reconstruction. The numbers in small squares attached to the haplogroup labels indicate the number of occurrences (mitogenomes) of the corresponding haplogroups found in public databases; the color of the squares indicates their geographic origin according to the legend inset. Spanish Romani complete genomes obtained in this study are indicated with yellow circles. More details on the geographic or ethnic origin of all the mitogenomes used in this network are provided in Table S1. The Indian M5a1b1a genome (FJ383591) seems to belong to M5a1b1a, but note that it lacks four diagnostic sites, most likely due to sequencing or documentation errors [53]?[55]."
