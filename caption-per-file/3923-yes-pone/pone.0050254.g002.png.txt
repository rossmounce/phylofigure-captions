16S rDNA Maximum Likelihood phylogenetic tree of cultivated and uncultivated Thiothrix species.Sequences obtained in this study are in bold face, and clone names indicate the sampling location and year (BG?=?Il Bugianardo, ST?=?Sorgente del Tunnel, GB?=?Grotta Bella, LV?=?Lago Verde, PC?=?Pozzo dei Cristalli, RS?=?Ramo Sulfureo, LC?=?Lago Claudia). Different numbers after cave name abbreviations indicate Niphargus individuals collected from the same cave location. N. ictus LV 2006 clones are from a previous study [12]. GenBank accession numbers are given in parentheses. Maximum Likelihood/Neighbor-Joining bootstrap values greater than 50% are listed next to the respective nodes, and the bootstrap value for clade T2 is also indicated. The dashed line encloses those Thiothrix sequences obtained from Frasassi microbial mats."
