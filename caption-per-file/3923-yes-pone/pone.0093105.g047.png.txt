"pone.0093105.g047.png","Calibrated phylogeny of Notosuchia based on the reduced strict consensus of our analysis.Dashed lines indicate the uncertainty on the age of each taxon. Major clades are collapsed (e.g., Neosuchia, Uruguaysuchidae, peirosaurids, Baurusuchidae, Sebecidae) and the age of the their oldest member is used for inferring the age of these nodes. The clade peirosaurids refer to South American forms (see Figure 28). Two distinct radiation events are inferred. The Aptian Radiation involves the initial diversification of Notosuchia and originated lineages recorded in South America, Africa, and China. The Turonian-Santonian Radiation involves the diversification of three clades (advanced notosuchians, Sebecosuchia+Comahuesuchus, and South American peirosaurids), which are exclusively recorded in the Late Cretaceous of South America."
