Phylogram of tick proteins from the novel 40-33 family. The bootstrapped phylogram (1,000 iterations) was obtained from the alignment of deducted Amblyomma maculatum proteins with homologs deducted from DBEST sequences described in a previous publication [2]. The Am. maculatum protein names start with Am- and are recognized by a red circle marker; the Ixodes scapularis protein is named IXOSCA followed by the first three letters of the species name followed by their NCBI gi| accession number. The number at the nodes indicates the bootstrap support above 50%, and the bar at the bottom indicates 20% amino acid divergence. Clades are indicated with Roman numerals."
