Phylogenetic tree of Vanguerieae with presence (blue) and absence (yellow) of endophytic Burkholderia bacteria.This phylogenetic dendrogram of the plant tribe Vanguerieae is adapted from Verstraete et al. [11]. Bacterial endosymbiosis is found in three groups of the tribe (arrows). Four species were not investigated because we did not have the specimens, and for seven other species we did not find Burkholderia endophytes although their phylogenetic position suggests so (not coloured). Bayesian posterior probabilities/bootstrap values are indicated below the branches."
