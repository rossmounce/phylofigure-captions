Phylogenetic analysis of murine and predicted bovine PIR Ig domains.Phylogenetic analysis of murine and predicted bovine PIR Ig domains: The Ig domains from murine PIR and the predicted bovine PIR (BL7 and BL10) were analyzed using phylogeny. Phylogenetic trees were constructed using the neighbour-joining bootstrap consensus method inferred from 1000 replicates, pairwise deletion and amino acid p distance. The graph shows the clustering of the individual Ig domains."
