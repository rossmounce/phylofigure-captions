Multiple alignment (A) and phylogenetic dendrogram (B) of the representative esterases.(A) Multiple alignment of esterase amino acid sequences. Numbers on the left are the residue number of the first amino acid in each line. Abbreviations and accession numbers for the esterases are as follows: Rhizomucor miehei (R.m. AGC24321), Pseudomonas mandelii (P.m. AEW10549), Paenibacillus mucilaginosus (P.m. AFH64822), P. syringae (P.s. AAZ35718), Bacillus amyloliquefaciens (B.a. AEB22650), P. fluorescens (P.f. AEV61721) and Rhizopus delemar (R.d. EIE77101). Identical residues are shaded in black, and conserved residues are shaded in gray. The conserved catalytic motif is underlined. The conserved HSL family motif is shown with dotted underlining. The putative catalytic nucleophile and acid/base are identified by a filled circle. (B) Phylogenetic dendrogram based on full-length amino-acid sequences of esterases by neighbor-joining algorithm, showing the position of RmEstA from R. miehei CAU432 relative to other esterases. The dendrogram is shown with the microbial sources and GenBank accession numbers of the esterases. Bootstrap values are expressed as percentages of 1,000 replications. Bar?=?0.1 sequence divergence."
