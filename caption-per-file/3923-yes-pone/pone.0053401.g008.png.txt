"pone.0053401.g008.png","Phylogenetic relationships of homologous PbTRIM sequences and their host species.(A) Neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree of homologous PbTRIM sequences derived from different ant species/lineages. The tree was produced from 36 PbTRIM elements (all belong to subfamily I) originally identified from the P. barbatus genome and 31 partial sequences identified from different ant species/lineages through PCR amplification. Branch lengths are proportional to the genetic distances. Only bootstrap values greater than 50 are shown. Homologous sequences derived from non-Pogonomyrmes ant species/lineages were indicated by different colored shapes. Numbers in brackets denote the clone numbers of individual sequences. Close square brackets indicate elements from different ant species that share high sequence similarity (see text for more details). (B) Phylogenetic relationship of 12 ant genera examined in this study. The tree was generated following Moreau et al. (2006) [41] and Brady (2006) [47], with Apis included as an out-group. PbTRIM homologues were found in three of the genera (shown in red) through PCR analysis."
