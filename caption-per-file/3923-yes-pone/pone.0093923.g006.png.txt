Neighbour-Joining phylogenetic tree based on divergences of ribosomal 5.8S-ITS sequences.The alignment of ribosomal 5.8S-ITS sequences from 10 isolates and 10 reference strains of Aspergillus spp. was performed using the CLUSTALΩ program. Nucleotide divergences were estimated according to the Jukes–Cantor model. Node numbers represent the frequency (proportion) with which a cluster appears in 1000 bootstrap runs."
