Analysis of Aspergillus nidulans LkhA sequence.A. A scheme of the protein kinase domain of lkhA was created using Scan Prosite. The black circle in the 3rd-exon indicates the ATP-binding region. The open and black triangles indicate the serine/threonine protein kinase active site signature and the LAMMER motif in the 4th exon, respectively. The capital letters, E and I, represent exon and intron, respectively. B. Multiple alignment of amino acid sequences in LAMMER kinase orthologs created with Clustal-W. Black marks indicate identical amino acids. Gray marks indicate similar amino acids. C. Phylogenetic tree showing the evolutionary relationship of yeast to human LAMMER kinases. Phylogenies were inferred using MEGA 4.1 to create a neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree. Hs, Homo sapiens; Dm, Drosophila melanogaster; At, Arabidopsis thaliana; An, Aspergillus nidulans; Sp, Schizosaccharomyces pombe; Ca, Candida albicans; Sc, Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Pf, Plasmodium falciparum; Nt, Nicotiana tabacum; Mm, Mus musculus."
