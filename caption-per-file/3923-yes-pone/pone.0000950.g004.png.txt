Selection pressure in HIV-1 V1-V3 during intra-patient viral population bottlenecks.Rooted Bayesian phylogenetic trees were obtained using the SRD06 relaxed clock model. Branch lengths were drawn in scale with the bar at the bottom indicating 0.01 nucleotide substitutions per site. Triangles represent clades for which statistically unsupported internal branches were collapsed. Ancestral (Anc) sequences were reconstructed by maximum likelihood. Internal branches under significant positive (dN/dS>2) or negative (dN/dSpost mortem tissue samples were the same used for the tree in Figure 2a. b. Subject S4. Longitudinal PBMC and post mortem tissue samples were the same, with the exclusion of sequences from brain, used for the tree in Figure 2b."
