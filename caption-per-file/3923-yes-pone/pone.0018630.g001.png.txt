"pone.0018630.g001.png","Unrooted phylogenetic tree of 142 env gene sequences from 16 Japanese subjects. The tree was constructed by using the neighbour-joining method (MEGA4). The 16 subjects are indicated as S_subject-number (Table 1). Viral samples from the 1980s are indicated in red while those from the 2000s are in blue. The higher bootstrap values (>70%) for major nodes were shown on the tree."
