"pone.0075208.g004.png","Analysis of partial hexon nucleotide sequences (nucleotides 139-1612/HAdV-B3).Phylogenetic tree with 1000 bootstrap replicates was constructed from selected sequences of adenoviruses isolated during 2002-2011, reference strains selected from GenBank. Bootstrap values greater than 80 were considered as significant and indicated in the figure. Strains of species HAdV-B from co-infected isolates are indicated by original isolate name; strains of species HAdV-C from co-infected isolates are indicated by isolate name -2 (e.g., N78/TW/03 is HAdV-B3, N78/TW/03-2 is HAdV-C2). Strains of repeated infections and strains in which only Loop 2 sequence has been identified were not shown in this phylogenetic tree."
