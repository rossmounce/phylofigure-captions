"pone.0047605.g001.png","A maximum likelihood (ML) phylogenetic tree of HIV-1 env gp 120 V1-C5 sequences from 50 subjects.The ML tree was constructed by PhyML 3.0.1 and visualized in FigTree. HIV-1 group N sequence was used as an outgroup. A representative subset of 516 out of 1796 DNA sequences generated in this study is presented in the Figure. Ten DNA sequences representative of each sample were chosen and analyzed with HIV-1 reference subtypes from the Los Alamos HIV Sequence Database. The inter-subtype recombinant DNA sequences were excluded in this Figure. Reference subtypes A1, C, D are shown in red, pink, and blue respectively. The other reference subtypes are shown in orange. The approximate likelihood ratio test (aLRT) values of ?0.95 were considered significant and are shown by an asterisk (*). Scale at the bottom of the Figure corresponds to 0.01 nucleotide substitutions per site."
