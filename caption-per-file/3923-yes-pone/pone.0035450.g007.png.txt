"pone.0035450.g007.png","Phylogenetic and primary structure analysis suggests a bifunctional role for Aspergillus nidulans pimaradiene synthase (AN1594.4). A) A phylogenetic tree of diterpene synthases was generated by using ClustalW2. Alignment of Aspergillus nidulans pimaradiene synthase AN1594 (XP_659198.1) with Gibberella fujikuroi ent-kaurene synthase; GfCPS/KS (Q9UVY5.1), Phaeosphaeria sp. L487 ent-kaurene synthase; PfCPS/KS (O13284.1), Phoma betae aphidicolan-16β-ol synthase; PbACS (BAB62102.1), Phomopsis amygdali phyllocladan-16α-ol synthase; PaDC1 (BAG_30961.1), Oryza sativa ent-pimara-8(14),15-diene synthase; OsKSL5 (NP_001047190.1), and Oryza sativa syn-pimara-7,15-diene synthase; OsKSL4 (NP_001052175.1). Phylogenetic tree indicates the similarity of AN1594 to fungal bifunctional diterpene synthases GfCPS/KS, PfCPS/KS, PbACS and PaDC1. AN1594 is also distantly related to known plant pimaradiene synthases OsKSL5 and OsKSL4. The phylogenetic distances are indicated next to the gene names. B) The primary structures of AN1594.4, PbACS, GfCPS/KS, PfCPS/KS and PaDC1 are shown. The inverted triangles indicate conserved motifs in fungal diterpene synthases. The AYDTAW motif is conserved among diterpene cyclases from plants and fungi. The DxDD and DExxE motifs are responsible for the type B cyclization (GGPP to copalyl diphosphate) and type A cyclization (copalyl diphosphate to diterpene), respectively. The InterPro domain IPR008930 “Terpenoid cyclase” is indicated with white bars. The total amino acid length of the proteins is indicated."
