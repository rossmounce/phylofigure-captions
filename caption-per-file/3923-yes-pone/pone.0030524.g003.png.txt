"pone.0030524.g003.png","Conservation of AS induced polymorphisms (AIPs) between homologs of the Arabidopsis AGAMOUS (AG) protein. A neighbor-joining tree illustrates the phylogenetic relationship between homologs of the Arabidopsis AG protein. Nodes with less than 70% bootstrap support are indicated with grey triangles. Except for Zea mays, which was included as outgroup species, the taxa within the tree are either members of the Brassicaceae subfamily or the Asteridae class. Residues behind taxon names correspond to the AIP sequence segment and an asterisk indicates that only the inserted residue(s) were found. No insertions were found in Arabidopsis and in P. hybrida. The distinct insertions found in R. raphanistrum might be the result of different allelic variants or sequencing errors. Note that the sequences from the taxa within the Asteridae are homologs of the FARINELLI (FAR) gene in Antirrhinum majus. The full names of the species used in this tree are provided in the Material and Methods section. The alignment corresponding to this tree is provided in Figure S5."
