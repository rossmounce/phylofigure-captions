Bayesian time-scale phylogeny of EV68 and other EVs based on the partial VP1 sequence analysis (dataset 1 containing 122 sequences with 723 nt in length).Maximum clade credibility tree obtained with BEAST with a constant size coalescent prior showing lineage splitting events since the most recent common ancestor to the presently circulating EV68 strains. The divergence times correspond to the mean posterior estimate of their ages. For the TMRCA, the correspondent 95% Bayesian credible intervals are shown. Time axis is shown in years and ranges from the TMRCA to the present year."
