"pone.0047955.g002.png","A phylogenetic tree showing the relationship of Nosema ceranae isolates.The partial sequences of 16S ribosomal RNA of N. ceranae from A. cerana collected in different geographic locations of China and from A. mellifera retrieved from GenBank were aligned using ClustalW. The tree was built using the Neighbor-Joining method. The sequence of Encephalitozoon cuniculi was used as an outgroup to root the tree. Numbers at each node represent bootstrap values as percentages of 500 and only bootstrap values greater than 50% are shown."
