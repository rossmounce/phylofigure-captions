"pone.0086819.g001.png","Molecular phylogenetic tree generated by Neighbor Joining and Maximum Likelihood methods with the concatenated sequences of calmodulin and internal transcribed spacer (ITS).In the bootstrap test (1,000 replicates), replicate trees in associated taxa were clustered together. The bootatrap for each tree branch is shown next to the corresponding branch. Star symbols indicate that the isolate was used for pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). The cross symbols indicate isolates used in hybridization experiments with genetic markers (probes)."
