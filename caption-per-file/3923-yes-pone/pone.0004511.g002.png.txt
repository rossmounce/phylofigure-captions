"pone.0004511.g002.png","Neighbour joining phylogenetic tree of Symbiodinium cultures Z1–Z4.Symbiodinium sequences obtained via cloning of PCR products are presented by culture name (i.e., Z1–Z4) followed by clone number and Genbank accession number (in brackets). Clones obtained from Symbiodinium cultures used to infect coral juveniles appear as Juvenile C1 and Juvenile D. Reference types representing Symbiodinium clades were obtained from authors listed in M&M. Bootstrapping with 1000 replicates was performed and values ≥50% were included for main nodes of the tree."
