(a) Rooted phylogenetic network of Maharashtra populations relating Y-STR haplotypes within macrohaplogroup CF (P143) and its associated phylogeny: The network was constructed using a median-joining algorithm as implemented in the Network 4.5.0.2 program. The size of the circles is proportional to the number of samples.
