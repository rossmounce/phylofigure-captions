"pone.0026874.g002.png","Phylogenetic relationships inferred from maximum likelihood analysis of CO1 and phylogenetic network of nuclear loci. (A) Unrooted ML network of CO1. Numbers on the branches represent ML bootstrap values. Geographic locality is represented by rectangle color as in figure 1B. (B) Phylogenetic networks of the concatenated nuclear loci using uncorrected ‘p’ genetic distances, colored by geographic locality."
