The recent, recombinant origins of Potato Virus Y genomes.The maximum clade credibility tree from the BEAST LN relaxed clock analysis is shown with error bars representing the 95% HPD of node ages according to LN (blue), EX (red) and SC (yellow) models. Recombinant strains such as pathogenic PVYNTN and PVYNW-B are represented as multiple taxa, each representing a subset of the alignment (as indicated) with distinct phylogenetic signal. Topology constrained nodes are indicated with red dots. Inset: a potato leaf showing mosaic patterns and tuber with potato tuber necrotic ring disease resulting from PVY infection."
