"pone.0056464.g001.png","Midpoint-rooted maximum-parsimony phylogeny of selected Termitomyces cultures (one per host) inferred from combined ITS, macromorphological and physiological characters.The host/mound index (see table 1) is the bold part of the labels of the leaves. Numbers above branches, separated by vertical bars, are maximum-parsimony branch lengths (DELTRAN optimization) estimated from the ITS (left), macromorphological (middle left), enzymatic test and carbon-degradation assay (middle right), and all characters (right). They are not shown for zero-length branches. Numbers below branches, separated by vertical bars, are partitioned and total Bremer support values, depicted in the same order. Single numbers printed in bold below branches are maximum-parsimony bootstrap support values from 1000 replicates. Stars indicate those branches on which macromorphology and/or physiology yielded more support and/or more changes than ITS. Vertical bars on the right side indicate the accordingly estimated species boundaries."
