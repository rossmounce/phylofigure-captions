"pone.0007985.g001.png","The taxon tree for the stomach microbiota.The tree was created based on the RDPII classifier based on a naive Bayesian rRNA classifier. The clone numbers for the top 5 phyla, top 6 classes, top 6 orders, top 7 families and top 10 genera were shown. Each taxon with at least 10 clones in all four sample groups (AGA, AGB, NmA, NmB) was analyzed by Pearson's chi-square test by comparing the clones numbers between AGA and AGB, NmA and NmB, AGA and NmA, and AGB and NmB. The clone numbers for all phylotypes were shown in Supplementary Figure S1."
