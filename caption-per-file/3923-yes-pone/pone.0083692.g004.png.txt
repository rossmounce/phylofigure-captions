Domain architecture and phylogenetic analysis of whitefly R2D2 protein.(A) Comparative domain architecture of whitefly R2D2 with other insects and C. elegans. Figure shows two DSRBD in whitefly R2D2 as reported in other insects and C. elegans. (B) (C) and (D) Phylogenetic analysis of full length, and DSRBD1 and DSRBD2 domains of whitefly R2D2, respectively. DSRBD1 clustered with aphids; however DSRBD2 clustered with B. mori, indicating independent evolution of both the domains."
