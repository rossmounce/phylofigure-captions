A median joining network representing all founding lineages found among Jewish communities and comprised of the 49 novel complete mtDNA sequences from non-Ashkenazi Jews and the four Ashkenazi lineages previously reported by Behar et al. [5].The nodes represent the Jewish communities in which the lineages were found. The network should not be regarded as demonstrating all nested bifurcations known to exist under each Hg, but as a schematic tree indicating the wide range of Jewish lineages spread throughout the human mtDNA phylogeny. Nucleotide positions in red correspond to the diagnostic positions inferred from the complete sequences information and checked in all samples suspected as a monophyletic lineage from the control region information. The three complete sequences that could not be clearly proved as monophyletic lineages are marked by an asterisk. Mutations are transitions, unless the base change is explicitly indicated. Deletions are indicated by a “d” following the deleted nucleotide position. Insertions are indicated by a dot followed by number and type of inserted nucleotide(s). The background colorization denotes the gross affiliation of the lineages into the following geographic mtDNA gene pools: green for West Eurasia, pink for Africa and blue for South Asia/ India. The information of the reported samples is presented in Table 2. To create the topology map we have applied the reduced median algorithm (r = 2), followed by the median-joining algorithm (epsilon = 2) as described at the Fluxus Engineering Website (www.fluxus-engineering.com)."
