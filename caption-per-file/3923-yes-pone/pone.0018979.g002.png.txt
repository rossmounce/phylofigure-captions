Phylogenetic tree of plastid 16S rRNA gene sequences for Stramenopiles. Sequences were retrieved from photosynthetic picoeukaryotes sorted by flow cytometry in the South East Pacific. The tree is inferred from 736 positions of an alignment of 72 partial sequences. The phylogenetic tree was constructed by the maximum likelihood (ML) method based on a TrN+I+G model of DNA substitution with a gamma distribution shape parameter of 0.6731 and substitution rates of R(b)[A–G] = 4.7980, R(e)[C–T] = 6.2129 and 1.0 for all other substitution rates. Total number of rearrangements tried was 70,499. Bootstrap values over 50% are indicated on the internal branches obtained from both NJ and MP methods. Sequences in bold are representative of OTUs amplified with primers OXY107F or PLA491F. OTUs amplified by only one primer set are marked by underlining the corresponding primer. Numbers enclosed between parentheses correspond to the number of clones retrieved for each OTU. OTUs encompassing relatively abundant clones are labelled in red. Symbols correspond to areas where clones were recovered for each OTU. Sequences from filtered samples [9] appear in blue."
