Multiple sequence alignment and tissue-specific expression of PTN in chickens. [A] The amino acid sequences of PTN from each of seven species (chicken, human, rhesus monkey, mouse, rat, cattle, dog and zebrafish) are presented based on alignments determined using Geneious Alignment [76] with BLOSUM (Blocks Substitution Matrix) and gap penalties. Amino acid sequences in the shaded boxes represent those that are identical among sequences for chicken and mammalian PTN and dashes indicate gaps in the sequences. [B] The phylogenetic tree of PTN generated from alignments of primary sequences of chicken, human, rhesus monkey, mouse, rat, cattle, dog and zebrafish PTN proteins using bootstrap analysis with 1,000 replicates. [C and D] Expression of PTN in various organs of male and female of chickens. Results of RT-PCR analysis using cDNA templates from different organs of male [C] and female [D] chickens with chicken PTN and chicken ACTB-specific primers. See Materials and Methods for complete description."
