A novel Rho-related protein in trypanosomatids. (A) Bayesian reconstruction of Rho protein phylogeny. See methods for details. Numbers at internodes indicate statistical robustness and are for Baysian/PhyML/RaxML posterior probability, bootstrap and bootstrap support respectively. Clades are indicated by vertical bars and taxa colored according to supergroup membership: blue; Opisthokonta, pink; Amoebozoa, green; Viridiplantae, Orange; Chromalveolata and purple; Excavata. T. brucei sequences are highlighted in bold. (B) Comparative genomics representation of divergent Ras/Rho-related proteins across multiple taxa as determined by reciprocal BLAST and phylogenetic analysis. Taxa are colored as in (B) and two letter abbreviations are as in (B) plus Sc; S. cerevisiae, Cn; C. neoformans, Dd; D. discoideum, Eh; E. histolytica, Cr; C. reinhardtii, Ot; O. tauri, Pf; P. falciparum, Tg; T. gondii, Pr; P. ramorum, Tc; T. cruzi, Ng; N. gruberi, Tv; T. vaginalis and Gl; G. lamblia. RLP, RLJ and RHP denote Ras-like protein, Ras-like protein with DNAj domain and Rho-like protein respectively. Gray bars are for clarity."
