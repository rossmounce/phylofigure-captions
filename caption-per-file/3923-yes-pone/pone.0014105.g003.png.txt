Phylogenic tree based on rrs-ileT spacer (IGS) sequences.The rrs-ileT spacer (IGS) sequences for 16 independent isolates from Israel and the West Bank belonging to genovars a to c were compared to IGS sequences from other Borrelia species (accession numbers are given in parentheses). The isolates in each genovar are listed in Table 1. The phylogenic tree was inferred using the UPGMA method as described in Figure 2. All positions containing gaps and missing data were eliminated from the dataset (Complete deletion option). There were a total of 349 positions in the final dataset."
