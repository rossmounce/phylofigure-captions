"pone.0094774.g004.png","Codon-based phylogenetic analyses inferred using CodonPhyml – Yap et al. model [52] for Maximum Likelihood – and MrBayes – GTR substitution model and three categories of non-synonymous/synonymous ratios (M3 model).Values on the nodes indicate the non-parametric SH test and bootstrap replicates (ML), and posterior probability (BI) support respectively. Where no values are shown on a node, that edge was fully supported under all analyses."
