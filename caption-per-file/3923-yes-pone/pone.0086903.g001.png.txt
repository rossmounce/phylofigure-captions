Phylogenetic analysis of the Agpat1â€“Gpsm3 locus including Ager.(A) The panel represents the structures of the Agpat1-Rnf5-Ager-Pbx2-Gpsm3 genes. The locus spans more than 1 Mbp in human chr 6. Ager (receptor for advanced glycation endproducts); Agpa1 (1-acylglycerol-3-phosphate O-acyltransferase 1); Gpsm3 (G-protein signaling modulator 3); Pbx2 (pre-B-cell leukemia homeobox 2); Rnf5 (ring finger protein 5). (B) A schematic phylogenetic tree with the main nodes. The presence of a gene is depicted by a green box, while the absence of the box indicates that the gene is not found in the specific phylogenetic group."
