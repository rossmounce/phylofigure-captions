"pone.0040120.g008.png","Phylogenetic relationships and sequence analysis of stress-responsive CCCH genes.(A) The phylogenetic tree was constructed using MEGA4.0 by the N-J method. Bootstrap values (above 50%) from 1,000 replicates are indicated at each node. (B) Sequence alignment of CCCH zinc finger motifs of the stress-responsive CCCH genes. The conserved CCCH zinc finger motifs are indicated by straight lines. (C) Sequence alignment of ANK repeat motifs of the stress-responsive CCCH genes. The conserved ANK motifs are indicated by straight lines."
