"pone.0055687.g001.png","Parsimony phylogenetic tree of S. Newport and outgroup genomes.This phylogenetic tree was reconstructed by TNT [38] with 100,000 iterations based on 147,780 genome wide SNPs. All S. Newport strains were grouped into two major clusters, S. Newport Lineages II and III. Lineage II was further grouped into three sublineages, IIA, IIB and IIC. S. Newport displayed clear geographic structure. Asian strains were grouped together and divergent from ones from Americas. At the locus between invH and mutS genes, Lineage II and all outgroup genomes shared Gene Cluster 1; however, Lineage III strains shared Gene Cluster 2. Gene Cluster 3 was only found in strain from fish_Hong_Kong at the 3? end of Gene Cluster 1. GC1?=?Gene Cluster 1; GC2?=?Gene Cluster 2; GC3?=?Gene Cluster 3. Additionally, Node M includes most MDR strains in the current study."
