RepPCR (Diversilab?) and UPGMA dendrogram obtained with 41 A/B1 CVP+ strains and 9 ECOR strains.(1) Phylogenetic group, as determined by PCR; (2) Phylogenetic group of ECOR strains; (3) ST: sequence type according to Achtmann's scheme; (4) STc: sequence type complexes according to Achtmann's scheme (corresponding phylogenetic group in brackets); (5) PCR O78. Strains were responsible for Urinary Tract nfection (UTI), Neonatal Meningitis (NM) or Bacteremia (B). Clusters of clinical isolates are framed in black and ECOR strains are underlined."
