"pone.0002250.g007.png","Phylogenetic tree showing OtV5.Asterisks indicate that at least one complete virus genome is available within the group. A phylogenetic tree computed by Bayesian analysis (BI) and maximum likelihood (ML) analyses on the partial DNA polymerase gene DNA sequences of selected taxa of the family Phycodnaviridae and other large dsDNA viruses. Genbank accession numbers of reference taxa are given in parentheses. The position of OtV5 is indicated in large bold type. Numbers are posterior probabilities (BI) and bootstrap proportions (ML; values below 50 are indicated by “–”) reflecting clade support."
