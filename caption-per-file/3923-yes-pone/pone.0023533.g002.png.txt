Mean volatile carbon fraction (Cvol) in woody tissues of 59 Panamanian rainforest tree species. Cvol averaged 2.48±0.17% (S.E.) among species, ranging between non-detectable in three species, to 4.73±0.13 (S.E.) in Terminalia oblonga (TERMOB). Cvol differed significantly among species (N = 190, F58,131 = 2.83, Pt58 = 14.84, PK = 0.206, P = 0.583). Error bars represent ±1 standard error of the mean, and the tree represents phylogenetic relationships among species as per APG2. Species codes are defined in Table S1."
