"pone.0021019.g005.png","Coffea S-RNase trans-specific polymorphism. A. The maximum a posteriori phylogram of putative Coffea S-RNase alleles is shown with midpoint rooting and branches receiving strong support are labeled (i.e.>95% posterior probability). The Psilanthus S-RNase homolog is indicated by a black box. The geographic origin of putative S-RNase alleles is indicated by the colored symbols following the labeling scheme in Figure 4 (African = red; Madagascan = blue). All putative S-RNase allelic lineages (i.e. sequences that consistently group together and exhibit minimal divergence) have been labeled on the tree (e.g. S1, S4, etc.). All individuals from the self-compatible species C. heterocalyx carry sequences from just one putative S-RNase allelic lineage (S12). The gene tree shows a clear signature of trans-specific polymorphism in putative S-RNase alleles sequenced from a phylogenetically and geographically diverse sample of Coffea species."
