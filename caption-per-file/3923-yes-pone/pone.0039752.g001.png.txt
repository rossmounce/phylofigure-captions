Phylogeny of the Felidae.(A) Single most parsimonious tree from the cladistic analysis, with Proailurus lemanensis as the outgroup. Felinae is treated as a single operational taxonomic unit (OTU) in the analysis, but is replaced with the topology in (B) for phylogenetic comparative analyses. Bootstrap percent support values and decay index values (in bold) are shown above and below each node respectively. (B) Internal relationships of Felinae based on [1], with extinct taxa inserted into relevant positions [27]–[29]. Asterisks denote taxa not included in the morphometric analysis, but employed in the phylogeny for dating nodes. Felid lineages are color-coded as follows: black, Machairodontinae; red, ‘Panthera’; sky blue, ‘Bay Cat’; maroon, ‘Caracal’; blue, ‘Ocelot’; orange, ‘Lynx’; green, ‘Puma’; pink, ‘Domestic Cat’; light green, ‘Leopard Cat’."
