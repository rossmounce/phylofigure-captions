"pone.0054471.g004.png","Counts of erythrocyte proteins in phylogenetic clusters mapped onto taxonomic classification.The classification has been shown up to a division/phylum level, except for Metazoa which have been expanded to show differences between different classes of animals (expanded to the equal level of depth) and Proteobacteria which have been expanded to include its classes. Red: cluster A, dark blue: cluster B, light blue: cluster C, yellow: cluster D, magenta: cluster E, green: cluster F, brown: cluster G, grey: unclustered cloud. Counts are normalized against cluster size."
