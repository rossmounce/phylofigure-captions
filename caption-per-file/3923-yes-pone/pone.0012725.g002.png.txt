"pone.0012725.g002.png","Domain structure and phylogeny of fungal adenylate cyclases.A Phylogenetic tree (100 bootstraps) constructed using the adenylate cyclase domain from fungal LRR-domain containing adenylate cyclases and other closely related sequences. These sequences had been identified in a full phylogenetic tree made from adenylate cyclase domains from species in each of the taxonomic groups used in this study (Table S6). Bootstrap scores of 50 or above shown for each branch. Protein IDs (from database sources listed in Table S1) are shown for each taxon. B Domain structure of a typical fungal adenylate cyclase. Order of domains shown from N-terminus on left to C-terminus on right. The size of the boxes is not intended to indicate the size of the domains."
