Evolutionary distribution and functional conservation of selected factors.A, Ribosome biogenesis starts with a 90S precursor which is processed to the 40S and 60S subunit. Association of the proteins during maturation of the 40S is indicated. B, The yeast factors were used as bait to perform a forward and reversed Blast search. The S. cerevisiae sequences were compared with the H. sapiens (red), A. thaliana (green), P. hirokoshii (blue) and E. coli (grey). Values for identity and similarity (in percentage; i and s, respectively) between bait and sequence identified in the corresponding species (indicated by color as in the phylogenetic scheme), and the e-value of the Blast search is given (e). A dash indicates that no sequence was identified fulfilling the criteria. C, Growth curve of Saccharomyces cerevisiae determined by the measurement of the optical density at 600nm is shown of one representative experiment (n>3)."
