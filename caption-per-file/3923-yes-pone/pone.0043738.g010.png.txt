"pone.0043738.g010.png","Phylogenetic relationships of group I introns inserted into phage DNAP genes (A) and their HNH proteins (B).All introns belong to IA2 subgoup of group I introns. The trees include only those HNH HEG-containing group I introns that are inserted in Bacillus phages (purple), Enterobacteria phages (blue), Xanthomonas phage (green) and cyanophage Pf-WMP3 (black). Horizontal distances are proportional to evolutionary divergence expressed as substitutions per site. Branch lengths higher than 0.1 are indicated on the tree branches. The scale bars represent 0.2 fixed mutations per amino acid position. GenBank accession numbers for intron sequences as follows: phiE (U04813.1), SP82 (BSU04812), SPO1 (M37686:), Bastille (AY256517), Pf-WMP3 (EF537008.1), phiI (AY769989.1), W31 (AY769990.1), phiL7 (EU717894.1). GenBank accession numbers for HEase sequences as follows: phiE (AAA56886.1), phiI (AAV53690.1), W31 (AAV53693.1). A phylogenetic tree was constructed using the neighbor-joining method in MEGA 4."
