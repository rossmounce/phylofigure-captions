"pone.0044193.g009.png","NEU1 and NEU2â€“5 phylogenetic subtrees in sialidase protein family.Detailed view of the phylogenetic subtrees of NEU1 sialidase subgroup (A) and of the other subgroups (B). The newly identified NEU5 subgroup emerges at the root of the NEU2, 3 and 4 subclasses. Bootstrap values are indicated for every node. Color code is used for different subclasses: NEU from protist K. brevis and from choanoflagellate M. brevicollis in grey, NEU1 in green, NEU2 in purple, NEU3 in cyan, NEU4 in red, NEU5 in blue. The tree is drawn to scale, with branch lengths measured in the number of substitutions per site."
