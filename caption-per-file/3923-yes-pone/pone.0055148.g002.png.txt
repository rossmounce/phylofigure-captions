"pone.0055148.g002.png","Phylogenetic tree of the 45 representative OTUs from bacterial 16S rRNA gene clone libraries (could represented all OTUs) and 32 cultivated bacteria from the four stations, constructed using neighbor-joining method of Phylip 3.66 based on the blast results of RDP classifer and EzTaxon server 2.1.The * represents the bacterial strains which were potential novel bacterial species. The phylogenetic neighbours were from the database of type strains with validly published prokaryotic names in the EzTaxon server (http://www.eztaxon.org/)."
