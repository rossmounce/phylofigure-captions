"pone.0083844.g004.png","Phylogenesis of RGAs from Malus species (wild and domesticated apple), Populus trichocarpa and Vitis vinifera.Phylogenetic analysis of the NBS domain was carried out by the neighbor-joining method [65] using RGA sequences of domesticated and wild Malus species (green), P. trichocarpa (cyan), and V. vinifera (purple). Proteins present in contiguous positions on the tree and belonging to the same species are merged (collapsed branches are indicated by the sign). Two phylogenetic clades comprise only sequences of M. domestica (Md1 and Md2)."
