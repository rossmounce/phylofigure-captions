Phylogenetic relationship of the five S. Typhimuriumstrains.(A) The phylogenetic tree was inferred with ML method based on the conservedgenomic sequences. The S. Typhimurium strains are rootedto S. Typhi Ty2. The upper-left subtree shows the phylogeneticrelationship of the five strains in a smaller scale. The relationship wassupported by the bootstrapping values shown on the subtree. The distance (markedin red) based on the number of SNPs was also presented on the phylogenetictree. The right panel shows the complete genome alignment of the five strainsgenerated in MAUVE [93].The regions conserved among all genomes are colored in purple and the regionsconserved among subsets of the genomes are colored differently. If the areascontain sequence elements not aligned, those are marked in white. Regionsthat are not colored indicate no detectable homology among the five genomesin MAUVE. The distinguished phages and phage remnants are marked on the alignment(black: detected among all of the five strains, red: detected in a subsetof strains). (B) Comparison of the lengths of genomes, phages, and genomesexcluding phage regions among the five S. Typhimurium strains.Length of phages is displayed on the second Y-axis due to the relatively smallvalue of phages in contrast to the whole genome size. (C) Alignment of theUK-1 Gifsy-1 sequence segment harboring the two UK-1 unique genes with sequencesfrom the other four S. Typhimurium strains. The sequencealignments were generated in MAUVE. The color scheme used for the alignmentis described in Fig. 2A.The predicted genes in these regions are shown with red solid arrays. Eachgene name is indicated with the strain name (UK indicates UK-1, STM indicatesLT2, 14- indicates 14028s, MW indicates D23580, and SL indicates SL1344) followedby its locus number obtained from each of the annotation files. The two UK-1unique genes are marked in red in the UK-1 genome."
