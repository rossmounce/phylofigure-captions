"pone.0078068.g001.png","Placement of C. obscurus within a time-calibrated phylogeny of Charadriidae.Shown is the BEAST topology. Black dots indicate nodes with Bayesian Posterior Probability (PP) >0.95 and Bootstrap Support (BS) >75, grey dots indicate PP >0.95 and BS 75. PP and BS values that are both lower than 0.95 and 75, respectively, are not indicated (for all support values, please see Fig. S1). Horizontal grey boxes (CRD I and II) highlight the non-monophyletic Charadrius groups. The asterisk marks the time-constrained split; node bars show 95% highest probability density (HPD)."
