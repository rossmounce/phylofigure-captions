"pone.0018615.g003.png","Protein Maximum Likelihood unrooted phylogenetic tree of PI-II genes and Pi7C and Pi6C natural variants. Pi7Ca-DC: Pi7C gene (EF469204) from the potato diploid clone 11379-03 that is essentially a Solanum tuberosum but with a background contribution from S. phureja and S. stenotomum. Other cultivars, Shepody, Kennebec, Zhongshu No. 3, are all tetraploid. Note that the Pi7C/Pi6C family cluster is separated from the standard 8C PI-II superfamily."
