"pone.0035574.g005.png","Synopsis of species diversity, distribution and larval host-plant use for the tribes of Tortricidae studied, mapped onto a phylogeny condensed from Fig. 3.The multiple branches leading to the names Eucosmini and Olethreutini s.s. denote the paraphyly of these tribes discovered here. Col. 1 = number of described species, taken from Table 3. Col. 2 = summary of geographic distributions, following Horak [29]. Cols. 3, 4, 5 = summary statements of predominant mode of larval feeding, host range, host taxa used and egg-laying habits, following Horak [29], Powell et al. [33] and J. Brown et al. [56]. ‘[]’ denotes assertion based on very few observations; preceding question mark denotes assertion based on uncertain or conflicting information; ‘( )’ denotes habits significantly represented but markedly less common than alternative; ‘;’ separates habits of similar frequency. In column 4, “oligophagous” = feeding on a single plant family, “polyphagous” = feeding on two or more plant families, as described in the text. Numbers in parentheses, compiled from Brown et al. [56], are number of polyphagous species/total number of species with two or more foodplant observations = % polyphagous species."
