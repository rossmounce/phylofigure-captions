"pone.0024698.g001.png","The Gas2 protein is conserved during evolution. (A) Phylogenetic tree of Gas2 protein. The phylogenetic relationship was derived by ClustalW program. The numbers represent the evolutionary distances. (B) Multiple sequences alignment of Gas2 amino acid sequences from different species. The alignment was generated using ClustalW. “*” indicates identical amino acids in all sequences in the alignment; “:” indicates that conserved substitutions have been observed; and “.” indicates that semi-conserved substitutions have been observed. (C) The mouse Gas2 protein [P11862] domain structure and amino acid sequence. N-terminal full-length GFP-Gas2, GFP-CH domain and GFP-Gas2 domain constructs were used in this study. The domains colors are matched with relative amino acid colored sequences. The boxed region indicates the 4 P-S repeats location, which gives this region more structural flexibility. (D) Western blot analysis of GFP Gas2 constructs expression. GFP = 27 kDa, full-length GFP-Gas2 = 62 kDa, GFP-CH domain = 49 kDa and GFP-Gas2 domain = 44 kDa."
