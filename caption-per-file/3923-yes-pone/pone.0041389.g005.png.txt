Enzymes of interest in biotechnology and novel metabolism.Gene counts of enzymes discussed in the text superimposed on rpoB′′ phylogeny. Methylaspartate ammonia-lyase (EC 4.3.1.2) – MA ammonia-lyase, methylaspartate mutase (EC 5.4.99.1) – MA mutase, succinyl-CoA:mesaconate CoA-transferase – SM-CoA transferase, polyhydroxyalkanoate synthase – PHA synthase, CRISPR associated sequences – CAS. Blue leaf labels indicate genomes sequenced in this study, black leaf labels indicate previously sequenced genomes. CRISPR and CAS data is represented as binary presence/ absence with abundance information provided in Table 3. MA mutase S subunit is also shown as binary although some species have two homologs of this gene, as only one homolog is present at the methylaspartate cycle locus."
