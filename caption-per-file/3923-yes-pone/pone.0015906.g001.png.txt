Phylogenetic analysis of plant fertility restorer proteins. Neighbor-Joining (NJ) method was used to perform a phylogenetic analysis of fertility restorer proteins from different families. The most abundant family members belong to the PPR repeat proteins (blue) followed by the ALDHs (red) and by the less abundant and divergent families (green). Plant species included in this analysis are maize, rice, Brassica, radish, wheat, Petunia, sugarcane, bell pepper and white ramie. Every new defined family of restorer protein has been depicted with the respective family number."
