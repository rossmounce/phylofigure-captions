Maximum likelihood phylogenies of atp1 and homologous regions of bobt from Silene vulgaris accessions. (A) Phylogeny using the complete sequence of atp1. The same topology was recovered when only the regions with homology to bobt were used. Numbers above lineages indicate bootstrap support for nodes in the phylogeny with the complete sequence, whereas numbers below the line represent support for node using only regions with homology to bobt. (B) Phylogeny including the shared regions of bobt, the atp1 genes found in the same individuals as bobt (KR & MV), and two additional atp1 copies from individuals from the Kovary CR population. Silene latifolia, Vitis vinifera, and Beta vulgaris atp1 sequences were used as outgroups. (C) Phylogeny of first 192 bases of the shared regions of bobt and atp1 homologous region found at the 5′ end of bobt. (D) Phylogeny of the region 3′ to the stop codon of bobt and the homologous region in atp1. This phylogeny includes 78 bases than are not found in bobt_KR, but are fond in the other accessions."
