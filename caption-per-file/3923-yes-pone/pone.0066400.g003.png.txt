Phylogenetic tree ofRAN binding protein 1 genes.This gene is listed as candidate #9 in Table 1. The tree was reconstructed with the maximum-likelihood (ML) method (see Methods). Bootstrap values were calculated with 100 resamplings. Support values at nodes indicate, in order, probabilities in the ML and the neighbor-joining (NJ) analysis. 119 amino acid sites were included for tree inference (shape parameter for gamma distribution ??=?0.38). Note that the topology of this ML tree is not consistent with the generally accepted species phylogeny, but the log-likelihood of the tree topology consistent with the species phylogeny was not significantly lower than that of the ML tree (Table 1). For this reason, this gene was included in the final dataset."
