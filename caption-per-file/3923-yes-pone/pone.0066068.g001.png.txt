Homologues of Piezo channel subunits in pathogenic protozoa.Phylogram showing the relationship between homologues of Piezo channel subunits (see Methods: based on 63 high-confidence positions from a multiple sequence alignment; gamma shape parameter 1.974; proportion of invariant sites 0.085). Homologues from different groups of organisms are indicated, along with the two phylogenetically distinct groups of homologues in trypanosomatid parasites. Branch length scale bar (amino acid substitutions per site) and branch support values >0.5 are shown. Protozoan homologues with incomplete sequences (see Table 1) are not shown."
