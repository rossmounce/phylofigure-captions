Phylogram of Ophiostoma sensulato based on ITS1-ITS2.Maximum likelihood (ML) phylogram of 75 ophiostomatalean fungi in the genus Ophiostoma sensulato, two in the genus Fragosphaeria, three in the genus Ceratocystiopsis, nine in the genus Graphilbum, and 11 in the genus Leptographium sensulato as an outgroup, based on ITS1-ITS2. Each strain is indicated by its species name, the Genbank accession number or CMW culture collection number (if accession number is not available), and a T if the isolate originates from a speciesâ€™ type specimen. Strains associated with D. valens either from this study or the Chinese studies [54,55] are in bold font, and are followed with the location they were isolated from. Strains are subdivided into species complexes indicated by different colors. Statistical support is given to the left of the nodes, with ML bootstrap proportions on top (only values greater than 75 are shown), and Bayesian posterior probability (PP) values on the bottom (only values greater than 0.90 are shown). * indicates that the ML or PP values were not significant at those nodes."
