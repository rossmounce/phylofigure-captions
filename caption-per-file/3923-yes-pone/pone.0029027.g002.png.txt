Mirror trees of the evolutionary history reconstructions of embryonic heart rates (beats per minute; left side) and the residual period of incubation (right), according to four different phylogenetic hypotheses (Aâ€“D). Some major clades are identified in A (equal positioning in B) and C (equal positioning in D)."
