The array of CPR cuticular protein genes located approximately at band 65A of D. melanogaster chromosome 3L and the orthologous regions in six other Drosophila species.A. Schematic of the organization of genes in the array, with colored boxes matching colored symbols in the phylogeny according to the legend at left. Numbered positions in the array correspond to numbered clades in the phylogeny of part B. Names at top are of D. melanogaster genes; plus and minus symbols indicate relative orientation. B. Neighbor-joining phylogeny (see Methods) of predicted amino acid sequence. Arrow indicates the clade within which genes cluster as paralogs rather than as orthologs (see text for details). Bootstrap support is not shown for clarity, but is greater than 90% for all numbered groups and generally low outside these groups."
