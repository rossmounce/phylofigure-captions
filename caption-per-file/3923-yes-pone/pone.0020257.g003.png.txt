Bayesian inference hypothesis of Ae. albopictus phylogeny based on COI and ND5 sequence data. The phylogeny was constructed using MrBayes 3.1.2, ngen = 2 000 000. Best-fitting models selected using MRmodeltest (AIC) were HKY for COI and HKY+I+G for the ND5 nucleotide dataset. Branch support is indicated by the posterior probability values. Accession numbers of COI and ND5 outgroup sequences are given in supporting information file Table S2."
