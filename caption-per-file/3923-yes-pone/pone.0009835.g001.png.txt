Bayesian tree depicting the phylogenetic relationships of pteropod molluscs. The genetic distance between cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) gene sequences of L. helicina individuals was 0.15±0.06% and 0.60±0.07% within the Arctic (L. helicina helicina forma helicina) and Antarctic (L. helicina antarctica) respectively, but 33.56±0.09% between poles. Support is indicated as posterior probabilities above nodes (* indicate 1.0 support) and bootstraps from a maximum likelihood analysis below (* indicate 100% support). The scale bar represents substitutions per site. GQ861824 and GQ861825 from the Amundsen Sea; GQ861831, GQ861832 and GU732830 from the vicinity of South Georgia; GQ861826/27/28/30 from the Beaufort Sea; AY22739 and AY227378 from [12]."
