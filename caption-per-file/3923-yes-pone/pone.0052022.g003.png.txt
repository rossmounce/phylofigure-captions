"pone.0052022.g003.png","The Q2 haplogroup tree, including seven new Q2a mitochondrial genomes identified in larger type.The figure is a branch-labeled phylogeny of the Q2 haplogroup. Unless otherwise indicated, the base changes shown are transitions from the revised Cambridge Reference Sequence (rCRS, [48]). A transversion is indicated by ?tv?, for example 228 GtvT is a transversion from guanine to thymine at position 228 on the basal lineage leading to Q2. Changes in RNA genes are shown by suffixes: ??r? for ribosomal genes, and ??t? for tRNA genes. Those in italics represent reversions to the same base as the rCRS. Non-synonymous changes within protein-coding genes are described by three-letter amino acid codes following the base number in square brackets. For example, ala-thr represents an amino acid change from alanine to threonine resulting from the substitution at that nucleotide. Deletions are marked by ?del?. An asterisk indicates the position required more than one step in the parsimony analysis (see Fig. 2). Positions requiring recurrent mutations within the tree have a bracketed number following the description indicating the first and second changes at the site. The changes relative to the rCRS at the M vertex are: 73G, 263G, 489C, 750G, 1438G, 2706G, 4769G, 7028T, 8701G, 8860G, 9540C, 10398G, 10400T, 10873C, 11719A, 12705T, 14766T, 14783C, 15043A, 15301A, 15326G, 16223T."
