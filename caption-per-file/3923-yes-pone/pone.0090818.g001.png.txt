"pone.0090818.g001.png","Phylogenetic tree of the E. coli RrmJ homologs from Eubacteria to Mammalia.This phylogenetic analysis represents the following three major homolog protein lineages: FTSJ1/Trm7p, FTSJ2/Mrm2p, and FTSJ3/Spb1p. The out-groups of the tree were catechol-O- methyltransferase, VP39, and fibrillarin (PDB code 1VID, 1AV6, and 1FBN, respectively). These out-groups were chosen because of their similar functions and structures to E. coli RrmJ. The number at each branch node indicates the reliability of the splits (%) through the processing of 1,000 bootstrap replicates. The GenBank accession numbers and species are shown for each protein. [F] and [S] denote proteins with known functions and protein structures, respectively."
