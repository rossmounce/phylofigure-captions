Inter-subject phylogenetic relationships of cloned Env sequences.Phylogenetic analysis was conducted on the entire Env sequence set as described in the Materials and Methods, confirming that the sequences cloned from the patient plasma samples are HIV-1 subtype C. The data also demonstrate no inter-sample mixing of Env sequences."
