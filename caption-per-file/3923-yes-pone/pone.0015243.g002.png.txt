Maximum likelihood phylogeny of rpoB sequences used in this study. Reconstructed ancestral sequences and extant strains that were tiled (blue circles) and strains that were hybridized onto the array (red squares) are indicated. Although genera Pantoea and Erwinia were grouped into a single clade when using the 169 rpoB sequences used for inferring ancestral sequences, the Pantoea/Erwinia clade is not recovered when using this restricted dataset, and the ancestral node was represented with dotted lines connecting the Pantoea and Erwinia branches."
