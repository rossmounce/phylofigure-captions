The root in the HYDA (NAR1, paralogs of HYDA) was pruned to conserve space. Given that NAR1 paralogs of HYDEFG do not exist, a different outgroup was chosen (i.e HYDAEFG from Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron) on the basis that the HYDA that it encodes, which branches basal to the eukaryote HYDA lineage."
