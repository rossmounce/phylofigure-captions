"pone.0092084.g002.png","Genotypic Characterization of HIV-1 primary isolates from Argentina.Phylogenetic trees were constructed for (a) partial pol (2253–3749, HXB2) and (b) vpu to env (5968–9092, HXB2) of Argentinean primary isolates. Sequences were aligned using Clustal X and trees constructed by neighbor joining method under the Kimura 2-parameter model. (c) Sequences were aligned and bootscanned as described in materials and methods to determine recombination sites. Sequences in green represent the subtype F1 regions and in blue-subtype B. Regions in the genome that were not sequenced are represented by empty boxes. The gray shading represents those sequences used for the phylogenetic trees in 2a and b respectively."
