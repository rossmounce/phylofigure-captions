Relationship between Desmophyllum dianthus and principal taxa from Scleractinia families based on mitochondrial COI.Phylogenetic relationships among D. dianthus and representative species of the family Caryophylliidae. R, C and B indicate “robust”, “complex” and “basal” groups, respectively. The phylogenetic relationships were inferred by BI, MP and ML criteria (numbers show the Bayesian posterior probability and bootstrap supports given at branches, respectively). Stars indicate other well-supported clades (pp≥95; bootstrap >70)."
