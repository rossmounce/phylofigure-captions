"pone.0042847.g001.png","Neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree based on 16S rRNA gene sequence (ca.1,400 bp) of actinomycetes from the tissue of soft coral Scleronephthya sp.The sequences obtained in this work are marked by black dot. The number is the percentage indicating the level of boot strap support, based on a neighbor-joining analysis of 1,000 resampled data sets. The scale bar represents 0.02 substitutions per nucleotide position."
