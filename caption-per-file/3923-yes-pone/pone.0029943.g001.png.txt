"pone.0029943.g001.png","Phylogeny of the Sclerotiniaceae inferred from 3 housekeeping loci showing incongruencies with pathogenicity-related genes trees, and results of acid production on indicator plates. A. Housekeeping gene phylogeny of the Sclerotiniaceae from the concatenated sequence of hsp60, g3pdh and cal. The putative obligate biotroph, Ciborinia whetzelii, was added based on the placement of Holst-Jensen et al. [52]. Thick branches represent well-supported nodes with >90% support from 1000 maximum likelihood (ML) bootstrapped pseudoreplicates and >0.95 posterior probabilities. An asterisk represents the node with >75% ML bootstrap support and >0.90 posterior probabilities. Trophic type is designated by text color: necrotrophs in red, biotrophs in green, and taxa with unknown life histories in black. B. Incongruence between the housekeeping gene phylogeny in Figure 1A and the phylogeny of each pathogenicity-related gene (acp1, asps, pg1, pg3, pg5, pg6, pac1, oah). Horizontally aligned with the housekeeping phylogeny, red fill designates a species incongruent with respect to the gene indicated at the top of the column and the housekeeping phylogeny; grey fill indicates congruence; white fill represents a gene that failed to amplify with the primers employed. C. Results from bromophenol blue plates indicating acid production as a proxy for oxalic acid production at two time points: 72 hours post-plating, and a final time point if acid production was delayed. Purple fill represents no color change indicating no acid production or production below the limit for detection, bright yellow fill represents a strong color change qualitatively indicating higher production, and a light yellow fill represents a less intense color change. Isolates not tested are n/a."
