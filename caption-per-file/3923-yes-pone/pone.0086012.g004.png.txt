Bayesian phylogeny of serpins from T. castaneum and D. melanogaster genomic and L. decemlineata transcriptomic sequences.Several serpins are specific for D. melanogaster (green box) with many alternatively-spliced isoforms of Spn4 (synonym Spn42, pink box) whereas beetle specific Spn4-like serpins are marked in yellow. L. decemlineata has several tandemly-duplicated serpins (red box), as previously reported in T. castaneum on chromosome 8 [53]. The tree was based on the WAG G+I protein model and run for 10,342,000 generations. Posterior probability values are indicated at the nodes. Sequences are named by a prefix of three letters indicating the species (Dme – D. melanogaster, Tca – T. castaneum, Ld – L. decemlineata) followed by either the accession ids and name in NCBI (for Dme and Tca) or contig name (for Ld)."
