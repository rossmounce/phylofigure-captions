"pone.0065387.g002.png","H.triquetra mitochondrial RNA polymerase.A. Schematic of the RpoT structure derived from multiple sequence alignments. Boxes indicate the conserved sequence blocks in the C-terminal domain (residues 502–1106), numbered following [37]. No region comparable to Block 1 of [40] could be identified in the N-terminal domain. Black blocks, 35–37% amino acid identity; gray blocks, 20–27% identity, dotted blocks, less than 20% identity but more than 25% similarity. Although block 10 has only three conserved residues, one of them is the penultimate Phe822 which is essential for nucleotide binding [21]. Block 2 (striped) consists of several smaller blocks of sequence relatedness. Lines (not to scale) represent regions with variable lengths and little or no relatedness among the RpoTs of different organisms. Grey oval, mitochondrial targeting sequence. B. Maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree of mitochondrial RNA polymerases plus that of bacteriophage T7, based on alignment of Blocks 3–10. Block 2 was not included because the T7 sequence was too divergent to make a reliable alignment. Full names and relevant accession numbers are given in Table S3. The Lingulodinium sequence was derived from two separate transcripts deposited in the Genbank TSA archive."
