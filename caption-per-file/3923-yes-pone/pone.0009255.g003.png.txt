Rooted Neighbor-Joining (N–J) phylogenetic tree detailing the relationships among all available complete bovine haplogroup I, P, Q, R and T mtDNA genome sequences and five yak (B. grunniens) mtDNA genome sequences.Evolutionary distances were computed using the Maximum Composite Likelihood method and are in the units of the number of base substitutions per site. Only coding region sequences of the mtDNA genome were used for tree construction (mtDNA nucleotide position 364–15,791). Bootstrap values (1000 replicates) are shown next to the branches. The number of mtDNA sequences within each of the haplogroups is indicated. The haplogroup to which the CPC98 mtDNA genome sequence belongs is highlighted. Five complete mtDNA genome sequences from yak (B. grunniens) were used as outgroups."
