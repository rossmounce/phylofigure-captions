"pone.0072572.g001.png","Phylogenetic tree of Stramenopiles species and distribution of CAZy genes in oomycete genomes.A Bayesian analysis was performed for 300,000 generations using a GTR/gamma distributed with invariant sites model of evolution of 28S rRNA gene. Bayesian probabilities are shown next to each branch. The distribution of seven gene families predicted from the genome of oomycete species and associated to carbohydrate degradation was compared to the phylogenetic relatedness thereof. Gene families: GH54 (orange), ?-L-arabinofuranosidase; GH85 (gray), endo-?-N-acetylglucosaminidase; GH11 (brown) and GH10 (green), endoxylanases; GH12 (red), xyloglucan-?-1,4-D-endoglucanase; CE8 (blue), pectin methylesterase; and cutinase within CE5 (purple). Gene copy numbers are indicated next to the bars. Diatoms: Phaeodactylum, Phaeodactylum tricornutum; and Thalassiosira, Thalassiosira pseudonana. Oomycetes: Ha, Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis; Phin, Phytophthora infestans; Phso, Ph. sojae; Phra, Ph. ramorum; Pyve, Pythium vexans; Pyus, Py. ultimum var. sporangiiferum; Pyuu, Py. ultimum var. ultimum; Pyiw, Py. iwayamai; Pyir, Py. irregulare; Pyar, Py. arrhenomanes; and Pyap, Py. aphanidermatum."
