"pone.0047801.g005.png","Gene structures of annexins from four representative genomes (moss, spike moss, Arabidopsis and rice) in plant lineage.The intron phases are highly conserved in all the genomes and represented in the maximum likelihood phylogeny tree. As shown in the legend, the intron phases in between exon-intron junctions are given as 0 and 1, exons are represented by green filled boxes, introns by black lines and untranslated regions (UTR) by blue filled boxes. The scale bar represents 0.2 amino acid substitutions per site. The gene structures were drawn using online tool Gene Structure Display Server (http://gsds.cbi.pku.edu.cn/)."
