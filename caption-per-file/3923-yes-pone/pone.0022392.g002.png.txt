X. tropicalis strain phylogeny. A consensus, unrooted, neighbor-joining tree representing the phylogenetic relationships between 55 sequenced individuals is shown. The UNC Nigerian F5 strain is represented by four individuals, the genotyped parents of the group 1 and group 2 animals previously analyzed. The Ivory Coast F8 and commercial Nigerian F5 individuals are labeled IC1-22 and N1-29 respectively. The bootstrap values are shown alongside the branches, indicating the number of times the partition of the individuals into the two sets separated by the branch occurred amongst the 100 trees on which the consensus tree is based."
