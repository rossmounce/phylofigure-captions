"pone.0005022.g004.png","The panorama phylogenetic tree of subtype H2 influenza virus based on the viral HA sequences.The tree suggested that H2 influenza viruses could be divided into 2 lineages, h2.1 and h2.2, comprising the avian viruses isolated from the Western Hemisphere and Eastern Hemisphere, respectively. Human H2N2 influenza viruses circulating in 1957–1968 formed a separate sublineage in lineage h2.2. Few swine H2 influenza viruses (•) were identified within this subtype. Bootstrap values were given at relevant nodes."
