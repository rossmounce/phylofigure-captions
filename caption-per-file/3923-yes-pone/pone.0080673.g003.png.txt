"pone.0080673.g003.png","Maximum-parsimony phylogenetic tree of complete mtDNA sequences belonging to haplogroup R2.Numbers along links refer to substitutions scored relative to rCRS [42]. Transversions are further specified; ins and del denote insertions and deletions of nucleotides, respectively; back mutations are underlined; symbol < denotes parallel mutation. Iranian samples labeled as in Table S1, for published data the accession number in indicated. The box containing the sample ID is color coded according to the geographic origin of the sample. Time estimates (in kya) shown along links next to clade labels are based on the complete mtDNA genome clock (marked in blue) and the synonymous clock (marked in green) [47]. Established haplogroup labels are shown in black; blue are redefined and red are newly identified haplogroups in the present study."
