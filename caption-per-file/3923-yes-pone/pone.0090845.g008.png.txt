Subtyping analysis of SB067-09 using jpHMM and manual phylogenetic analysis.A). jpHMM result: A breakpoint is located at position 2820+/âˆ’ 14 (HXB2 numbering). B). Posterior probabilities of the subtypes at each sequence position (original sequence positions) calculated by jpHMM. Posterior probability values are indicated on the y axis and nucleotide positions in the alignment are shown on the x axis. C) and D). Phylogenetic analysis (NJ trees) of two fragments identified by the jpHMM breakpoint."
