"pone.0019582.g002.png","Haplotype network. Haplotype network for 20 haplotypes from 426 bp of mtDNA. Each black circle represents a single mutational change. The white circles indicate haplotypes from extirpated populations in the southern U.S [25]. The coloured circles and haplotype labels are consistent with Figure 1. The size of each circle is proportional to the observed frequency of a given haplotype. The maximum circle size is for N = 50, if N>50 the actual frequency is indicated. The black square represents a missing or hypothetical haplotype. Shaded regions define phylogroups 1, 2, 3 and 4 are labeled P1, P2, P3 and P4, respectively."
