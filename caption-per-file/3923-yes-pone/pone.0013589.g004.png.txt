Phylogenetic analysis of bacterial species/phylotypes contributing to species/phylotype diversity in GCF samples and PP samples.The species/phylotypes with statistically significant PLS regression coefficients >0.02 or Figure 2B for the GCF samples and from Figure 5 for the PP samples) were selected for the phylogenetic analysis. The marker bar represents 5% difference in nucleotide sequences. GF abbreviation for gingival crevicular fluid and PP for subgingival paper point samples. Black boxes indicate presence and white boxes absence of the depicted species/phylotype."
