Minimum spanning tree of the similarity matrix of the composite data set consisting of the FAFLP pattern, serotype, oprI, oprL, and oprD gene sequences, pyoverdine receptor profile and prevalence of exoS/U for 328 P. aeruginosa strains.Each circle corresponds to a polyphasic profile (PP). The circles are scaled with member count. Branch lengths are logarithmic. Coloured zones surround PPs that belong to the same clonal complex. These complexes are also indicated with a capital letter. The lines between PPs indicate inferred phylogenetic relationships and are represented as bold, plain, discontinuous and light discontinuous depending on the number of differences between profile types. Discontinuous links are only indicative. Two bold black indent lines delimit the P. aeruginosa “core lineage”; the MDR serotype O12 clone is encircled by a red dotted line."
