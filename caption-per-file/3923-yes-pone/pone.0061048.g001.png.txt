"pone.0061048.g001.png","Method overview of PACo.(1) The phylogenetic information encapsulated by the host-parasite (H-P) tanglegram gives way to two distance matrices of host and parasites, and a binary matrix of host-parasite (H-P) links. (2) The distance matrices are transformed by Principal Coordinates. (3) The H-P link matrix (A) is converted into an identity matrix to account for multiple host-parasite associations. (4) Rows in the Principal Component matrices are duplicated (arched arrows) following the order dictated by the identity matrix. (5) The extended Principal Coordinate matrices (X and Y) are centred by mean column vectors and subjected to Procrustes analysis, where the parasite configuration is rotated and scaled to fit the host configuration. The fit can be visualised in a Procrustes superimposition plot. (6) The analysis yields a global goodness-of-fit statistic (), whose significance can be established by a randomization procedure, and individual link residuals that can be further analysed to establish the contribution of each H-P link to the global fit."
