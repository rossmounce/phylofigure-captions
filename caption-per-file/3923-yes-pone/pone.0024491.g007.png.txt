Phylogenetic analysis of HAdV-D58 hexon loops 1 and 2. Analysis of HAdV-D58 hexon L1 and L2 is based on the nucleic acid sequence of (A) hexon and (B) hexon L2. Phylogenetic trees were constructed from aligned sequences using MEGA, via the neighbor-joining methods and a bootstrap test of phylogeny. Bootstrap values shown at the branching points indicate the percentages of 1000 replications produced the clade."
