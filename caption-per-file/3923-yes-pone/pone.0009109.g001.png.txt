"pone.0009109.g001.png","Phylogenetic analysis of partial 16S rDNA sequences of all cultivated and uncultivated Shewanella.The sequences of Shewanalla, Aeromonas and Moritella were all from GenBank (362 taxa in total). The phylogenetic tree was generated based on pair-wise nucleotide distance of Kimura two-parameter using the neighbour-joining method (pair-wise deletion, 3000 bootstrap value) included in the MEGA3 software package [68]."
