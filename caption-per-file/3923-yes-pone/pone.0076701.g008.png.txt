"pone.0076701.g008.png","Phylogenetic analysis of ATAD3 sequences.The top 500 sequences related to the mammalian ATAD3 were used in this analysis as shown as a circle phylogenetic tree (inset). This analysis illustrated the evolutionary distribution of the orthologous ATAD3 genes throughout animals, plants, and protists (such as alga and protozoa), indicated by a red arrow. Animal ATAD3-related sequences were subtracted as shown in an NJ tree. ATAD3 genes from vertebrates, insects, and worms clustered as a phylogenetic branch with strong bootstrap support. Gene duplication events in humans and likely in other primates as well are highlighted by red bold letters as 3A, 3B, and 3C after each GenBank accession number. The bootstrap values greater than 50% are indicated."
