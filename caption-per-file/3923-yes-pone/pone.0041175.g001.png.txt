Overview of primate phylogeny.An overview of primate phylogeny is shown, with the number of ADH1 paralogs identified within select taxon indicated by the circled numbers at the leaves of the tree. Black numbers are derived from analysis of public databases, while red numbers were determined from cDNA sequencing reported here. The “4+1” designation for the macaque taxon indicates the presence of four ADH1 paralogous genes plus one ADH1 pseudogene. The genome sequencing projects are not completed for any lemur, so additional ADH1 paralogs may be present (see text)."
