Bayesian maximum clade credibility phylogram (A) and chronogram (B) inferred with the 1D gene encoding the VP1 capsid protein, depicting the phylogeny of EV-A71.The trees were estimated with general time reversible nucleotide substitution model, an uncorrelated exponential clock model, and the Bayesian skyline as a tree prior. The posterior probability of the eight nodes used to compare different evolutionary models (see also Figures 4 and 3) are indicated. The posterior probability (pp) are indicated for the main nodes."
