"pone.0011123.g002.png","Decomposition of dispersal diversity along the butterfly phylogeny.The circles at nodes provide the contribution of the node to total diversity in dispersal metric. The scale is given at the bottom left-hand corner of each panel. White circles are for nodes in the original classification, grey circles are for the contribution of within-species diversity to the total diversity. Grey branches denote replicates for a given species, here described as virtual sister-taxa. A: dispersal fraction: proportion of recaptures with inter-patch movement in multisite mark-recapture. B, C: respectively alpha1 and alpha2 that describe the shape of a negative exponential dispersal kernel measured in small (1.9 km) study sites. D: P5km, the probability of dispersal movement â‰¥5 km, estimated from the shape of inverse power dispersal kernels. E: Daily moves, the mean daily displacements in mark-release-recapture surveys. F, G, H: FstL, FstR and FstC, measures of the genetic structuring (FST) from allozyme surveys respectively at the landscape scale (600 km)."
