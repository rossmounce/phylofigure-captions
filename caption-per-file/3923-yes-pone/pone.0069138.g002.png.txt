"pone.0069138.g002.png","Phylogeographic relationships within Bostrychiaintricata based on COI and rbcL data.The phylogenetic trees indicate relationships among, and diversity within, major clades or lineage groups (distinguished by colour); support for these clades is shown by Bayesian Posterior Probability values above branches, and ML bootstraps below (those in parentheses show ML bootstraps of >50% for the concatenated analysis of all markers). Outgroup taxa have been removed for clarity. The map indicates clade distributions and proportions at each locality, with multiple haplotypes at a site indicated by pie divisions."
