"pone.0023602.g001.png","Reconstruction of phylogeny for 68 Tetrao urogallus and 5 Tetrao parvirostris mtDNA control region haplotypes. A – Maximum likelihood tree according to HKY+G model of nucleotide substitutions with a Ti/Tv ratio of 6.2287 (kappa 11.9429) and gamma distribution parameter alpha of 0.115. Bootstrap support values of 1000-replicate analysis are given for nodes. Western Capercaillie (Tetrao urogallus) mtDNA CRI haplotypes discovered in this study in the Balkans and south-eastern Alps are presented in bold. Black-billed Capercaillie (Tetrao parvirostris) sequences were used as an outgroup. SloA – Slovenia, Alps; SloD – Slovenia, Dinarides; SloAD – Slovenia, Alps and Dinarides; Cro – Croatia, Dinarides; BiH – Bosnia and Herzegovina, Dinarides; Mne – Montenegro, Dinarides; Srb – Serbia, Dinarides; Bg – Bulgaria, Dinarides; Brs – Belarus, Pripyat; Pol – Poland, Carpathian Mountains. B – Minimum spanning network (using Median-joining algorithm with Maximum parsimony post-analysis). Western Capercaillie (Tetrao urogallus) mtDNA CRI haplotypes discovered in this study in the Balkans and south-eastern Alps are presented in bold. Black-billed Capercaillie (Tetrao parvirostris) outgroup (linked to haplotype C1) was omitted for clarity. The size of nodes corresponds to haplotype frequencies. Jackknife support, based on a 100-replicate analysis, of the most likely inter-lineage links and C1-to-outgroup link are presented in [ ], values in under haplotypes T3 and Tu44 represent jackknife support of their basal-most and terminal-most position within respective lineage haplogroups."
