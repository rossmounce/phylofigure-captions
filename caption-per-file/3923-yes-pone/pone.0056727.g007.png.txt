"pone.0056727.g007.png","Phylogenetic distribution of bacterial nicotinamidases.For reasons of clarity, branches are shown compressed as triangles. The scale bar at the lower left indicates the rate of amino acids substitutions. The triangle base corresponds to the number of compressed sequences involved, which is also shown in parentheses. The triangle height corresponds to evolutionary distance. The bacterial nicotinamidase sequences used in this study (see text for details) are phylogenetically divided into 4 groups, in which biochemically characterized nicotinamidases are positioned according with its activity towards nicotinamide and/or pyrazinamide. E. coli isochorismatase was used as outgroup. The phylogenetic tree was obtained using MEGA 5.0 [53]."
