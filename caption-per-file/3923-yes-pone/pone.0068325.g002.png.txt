"pone.0068325.g002.png","Phylogenetic analysis of Pichiapastoris Pmt proteins and related homologues.The phylogenetic tree was generated in the MegAlign application of the Lasergene Suite of applications (DNASTAR, Madison, WI) following CLUSTALW alignment. The scale at the bottom represents the evolutionary distance by amino acid substitutions. The PMT members from Pichiapastoris (PpPmt), Candida albicans (CaPmt), Saccharomyces cerevisiae (ScPmt), Aspergillus nidulans (AnPmt) and Schizosaccharomyces pombe (SpPmt) were compared. Sequences were derived from genomic databases (http://www.Pichiagenome.org/; http://www.yeastgenome.org/; http://www.broadinstitute.org/)."
