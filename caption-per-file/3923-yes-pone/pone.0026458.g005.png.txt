A wide-range maximum likelihood tree showing the phylogenetic positions of endophytic clones and DGGE bands. Phylogenies were inferred from 16S rRNA gene sequences determined in this study (in bold), BLAST hits (see Table 1), Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria and Mollicutes type strains, and algae-associated bacteria described in the literature (see Table S1). The tree was generated in PhyML according the HKY G4 algorithmic model. Bootstrap values above 50% are indicated at the branch nodes and the scale bar shows 10 nucleotide substitutions per 100 nucleotides. Asterisks denote sequences previously isolated from micro * - and macroalgae**. The same phylogenetic tree without compressed branches is depicted in Figure S1."
