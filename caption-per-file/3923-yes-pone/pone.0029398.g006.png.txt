"pone.0029398.g006.png","Phylogenetic relationship of D. miles with other dinoflagellates inferred from cox1. Sequence obtained in this study is bold-typed. Support of nodes is based on bootstrap values of NJ/ML with 1000 and 500 resamplings, respectively. Only values greater than 60 are shown. If only one of the two phylogenetic methods yielded significant support, the other is shown with “-”. Oxyrrhis marina was used as the outgroup to root the tree. In this tree, D. miles is separated from D. ovum and D. acuminata."
