"pone.0030559.g002.png","Phylogenetic position of Ca. ‘A. autotrophicum’. A maximum likelihood tree was constructed by using RAxML [51] and PHYML [49]. A) A concatenated alignment of the sequences of 4 common proteins (Pgk, PyrG, rplK, and rpsI) among 358 bacteria, including Ca. ‘A. autotrophicum’ and nine archaea. B) A concatenated alignment of the sequences of 16 common protein sequences (DnaG, Frr, InfC, NusA, pgK, PyrG, RplA, RplK, RplL, RplS, RplT, RpmA, RpoB, RpsB, RpsI, and SmpB) among 358 bacteria including A. autotrophicum. C) Phylogenetic position of candidate division OP1 containing A. autotrophicum among the prokaryotic major lineages (phyla) based on 16S rRNA genes. The name of cultured and uncultured species used for construction of the phylogenetic tree is listed in Table S2 and S3. The numbers indicate the percentages of bootstrap support. Bootstrap values less than 50% were omitted from this figure."
