Phylogenetic tree of EPF/EPFL genes.Amino acid sequences for the mature peptide region were aligned using the ClustalW program. The phylogenetic tree was reconstructed by the ME method from the numbers of amino acid substitutions estimated by the JTT model. The numerals at the branch indicate bootstrap values calculated by the ME method with 1,000 replications. Bootstrap values >50% are shown."
