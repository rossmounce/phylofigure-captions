Maximum likelihood trees showing phylogenetic relationships for the Centromochlus existimatus species complex.Phylogenetic relationships are inferred from sequences of the mitochondrial ATPase 6 and 8 genes (a) and the nuclear RAG1 gene (b). Codes A?D correspond to the five different phylogroups, as in Figure 1. Numbers below branches are the posterior probability and bootstrap support values base on BI/ML/MP/NJ analysis respectively."
