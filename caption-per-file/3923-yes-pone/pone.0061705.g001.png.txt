Phylogenetic relationship of the group L glycosyltransferases from Arabidopsis thaliana.The phylogenetic tree of Arabidopsis UGTs is adopted from the previous report [40]. Bootstrap values are indicated above the nodes. The glycosyltransferase sequences were retrieved from Carbohydrate-active enzymes database (http://www.cazy.org/GT1_eukaryota.html) and NCBI database. The asterisks indicate those glycosyltransferases with confirmed enzymatic activities toward phytohormone related compounds."
