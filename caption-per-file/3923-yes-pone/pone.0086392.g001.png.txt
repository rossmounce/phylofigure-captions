"pone.0086392.g001.png","Maximum likelihood trees showing phylogenetic comparisons of the aa sequences of VP1 of ORUV, LEBV and CGLV, aligned with those of other Orbivirus species.Figure 1 is an ML amino acid tree, respectively, both depicting the three groups of orbiviruses (i-Culicoides?/sandfly-borne, ii- mosquito-borne and iii- tick-borne) as separate clusters. The polymerase of Banna virus (genus Seadornavirus, family Reoviridae: a 12-segmented mosquito-borne dsRNA virus) used as outgroup. This figure shows the root to be located between the tick/tick-borne orbiviruses and the insect-borne orbiviruses. LEBV, ORUV and CGLV all cluster among Culicoides-borne orbiviruses. The scale bar represents the number of substitutions per site."
