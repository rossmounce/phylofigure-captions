"pone.0019385.g008.png","Neighbor-joining phylogenetic analysis of Lag1, Lac1, and Bar1 protein sequences in Ashbya gossipii (Ag), A. nidulans (An), Candida albicans (Ca), Candida glabrata (Cg), Debaryomyces hansenii (Dh), F. graminearum (Fg), Kluyveromyces lactis (Kl), Vanderwaltozyma polyspora (Vp), and Yarrowia lipolytica (Yl). HsLass1p/6p are ceramide synthase sequences from Homo sapiens used as out-groups. This analysis suggests that ScLac1 (and Lac1 genes from other non GlcCer-producing yeast strains) likely represents a Lag1 paralog, whereas Lac1 from GlcCer-producing yeast strains is an ancestral Bar1 orthologue that was lost in non GlcCer-producing strains. Bootstrap values calculated from 1000 iterations."
