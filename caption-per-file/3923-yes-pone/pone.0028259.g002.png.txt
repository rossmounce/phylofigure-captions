"pone.0028259.g002.png","The UPGMA phylogenetic trees of A) the concatenated sequences of the housekeeping genes (pyrD, abcZ, gnd, gdh, fumC, glnA, pgm, aroE, pdhC and adk) and B) the porB sequences of N. gonorrhoeae. The tree was constructed using the matrix of pairwise differences. Bootstrap test was for 1000 repetitions. Each isolates of the MLST tree is marked by its sequence type (ST).The isolates of circulating strain ST1 and ST2, confined in northern part of the province Saskatchewan, are indicated by their STs in both the MLST and porB trees."
