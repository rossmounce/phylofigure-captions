"pone.0003207.g006.png","Phylogeny and life history evolution.The phylogeny (left) is a strict consensus cladogram with proportional branch lengths obtained by analyzing two types of molecular characters (RAPD markers and rRNA sequences [19]). The collembola Isotoma viridis Bourlet was used as an outgroup. The topology of the upper clade is unresolved due to contradictory signals—not because of lack of genetic variation. The life history distance tree (right) was derived from a hierarchical cluster analysis performed on the genetic values of egg size and reproductive investment expressed in P2 (cf. Figure 4c and methods). The two trees are highly congruent (comparison of the two associated distance matrices, 1000 permutations, Friedman's χ21 = 96, P"
