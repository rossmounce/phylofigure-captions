Phylogenetic tree analysis of RNA helicase in Arabidopsis, Oryza sativa, Zea mays and Glycine max.(A) The DEAD-box RNA helicase proteins in four species. (B) The DEAH-box RNA helicase proteins in four species. (C) The DExD/H-box RNA helicase proteins in four species. The amino acid sequences of the RNA helicase proteins were aligned with ClustalX, and the phylogenetic tree was constructed using the neighbour-joining method in MEGA 5.0 software. Each node is represented by a number that indicates the bootstrap value for 100 replicates. The scale bar represents 0.05, 0.1 and 0.1 substitutions per sequence position, respectively."
