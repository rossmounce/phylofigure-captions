Phylogenetic analysis (bootstrap) of plasmepsin -V using neighbor joining method.(A) Different orthologue sequences of plasmepsin-V from different pathogenic protozoan. Plasmodium vivax_Ind (PvPM-V-Ind) is the mutant sequence from the Indian isolates. (B) Cropped and zoomed in phylogenetic tree from Figure 3A showing Indian isolates to be a more evolved gene."
