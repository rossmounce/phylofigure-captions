Phylogenetic analysis of the biotin-lipoate A/B protein ligase family.Neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree of the cofactor transferase domain (Pfam03099) that includes 11,826 biotin and lipoate-ligase proteins and octanoyl-carrier proteins from eukaryotes, eubacteria and archaea. Annotation of the five broad protein domain clades as LipM (red), LplA (orange), LipL (blue), LipB (green) and biotin protein-ligase (black) clades was based upon the presence of biochemically characterized proteins within each protein set. In total, 295 archaeal sequences were included in this analysis with 161 residing in the biotin-ligase clade (54.5%) and the remainder residing in the LipM, LplA or LipB clades."
