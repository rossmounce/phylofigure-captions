"pone.0085023.g001.png","Phylogenetic analysis of the enterovirus isolates based on the whole VP1 gene sequences.The tree was constructed by using the neighbor-joining method. Significance of phylogenies was investigated by bootstrap analysis with 1,000 pseudoreplicate data sets. Bootstrap values of are indicated on the tree. ●, ▲and ◆: Enterovirus isolates from this study. All reference sequences are named by using the sample name/serotype/GenBank accession numbers. Rhnovirus JAL-1 was used as out group control. The scale bar indicates nucleotide substitutions per site. The bracket on the right indicates the enterovirus species."
