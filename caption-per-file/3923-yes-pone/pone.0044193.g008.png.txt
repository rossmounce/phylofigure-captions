Complete phylogenetic tree of the sialidase gene family.Complete phylogenetic tree of the sialidase gene family reconstructed using Maximum Likelihood method and WAG+G amino acid substitution model. The tree is drawn to scale, with branch lengths measured as number of substitutions per site. The tree with the highest log likelihood (-38941.9521) is shown. Human sialidases are reported in bold. Different subgroups are represented with different colors: NEU1 in green, NEU2 in purple, NEU3 in cyan, NEU4 in red and NEU5 in blue. Branches containing the protist K. brevis and the Choanoflagellata M. brevicollis are represented with grey lines. Bootstrap analysis was conducted with 1000 replicates (bootstrap values are reported in detailed trees in Figure 9). Sialidase from the flagellate S. vortens (Svo NEU1) is placed at the tree root. The tree was constructed, visualized and manipulated using MEGA5."
