"pone.0034961.g005.png","Maximum likelihood (ML) phylogenetic tree based on a 70 nt L-gene fragment for 33 different Paramyxovirus species. An L-gene fragment of the rhabdovirus Taro vein chlorosis virus (AY674964) was used as outgroup. Sequenced in black were obtained from Genbank while sequences in red were obtained from the avian surveillance study reported here. The length of the branch of Taro vein chlorosis virus as an outgroup is broken, and therefore does not represent its genetic distance to the rest of the tree. Accession numbers used for the phylogenetic tree were: NC003443, EU627591, NC009489, NC002200, NC009640, NC006430, NC006428, EU338414, EU403085, FJ177514, GU206351, NC003043, FJ231524, FJ215863, EU910942, NC002617, NC002161, C003461, NC001796, NC001552; NC001906, NC002728, NC001921, NC005283, NC001498, NC006383, Y09630, NC006296, NC001989, NC001781, NC006579, NC007652, NC004148."
