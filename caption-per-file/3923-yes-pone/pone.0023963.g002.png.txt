Sequence-based phylogenetic trees of insects compared to the phenotype-based tree. The phenotype-based tree (A) was drawn using the data presented by Iwatsuki et al., (1960), which appeared in the Biological Encyclopedia (published by Iwanami, Tokyo, Japan, 1900). The numbering put at each front came from the taxon number of probable evolutionary order of appearance. Species that belong to the same Order are shown in the same color. (B) The tree obtained using insect 18S rDNA sequences is depicted similarly as in panel A. (C) The insect 18S rDNA sequences which were confirmed against the NCBI database, i.e., those sequences which appear in the NCBI database with the congruence of more than 97%, were used to draw this tree."
