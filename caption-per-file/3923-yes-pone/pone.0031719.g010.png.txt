Regions with sequence similarity in Paramyxovirinae P and C. The N-termini of Paramyxovirinae P and the C proteins that overlap them are represented to scale (the N-terminus of henipavirus P is about 380aa long). The phylogenetic relationships between different genera are shown on the left as a cladogram based on [71]. Regions with statistically significant similarity (and thus homologous) are shown in the same colours, whereas regions that have subsignificant similarity are shown in grey. The crisscrossed regions of henipavirus and morbillivirus P are homologous, even though they have no detectable similarity, since they overlap homologous regions of C, in green (see Discussion)."
