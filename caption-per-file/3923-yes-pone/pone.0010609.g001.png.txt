"pone.0010609.g001.png","Speciation as seen in phylogenetic trees of asexual organisms descended from a single asexual founder.(A) A single species is an inclusive population that is limited to some number of individuals N by the carrying capacity of the environment and will show extinction of lineages due to stochastic processes. The effective population size Ne is a smaller number reflecting the fact that different individuals are producing different numbers of offspring. This results in clades (open bars) and singlets (circle) separated by transient gaps with an average depth of 2Ne generations. (B) A tree in which two lineages have been physically separated, e.g. by distance, or have undergone divergent selection for adaptation to different niches (or both) long enough to complete lineage sorting and become reciprocally monophyletic. The populations form two clusters separated by a gap that becomes deeper over time until it is much deeper than 2Ne generations."
