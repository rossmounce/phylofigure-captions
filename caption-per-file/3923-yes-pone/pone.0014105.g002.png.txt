"pone.0014105.g002.png","Phylogenetic tree based on the rrs-rrlA spacer region.The tree was inferred using the UPGMA method. The bootstrap consensus tree inferred from 250 replicates is taken to represent the evolutionary history of the taxa analyzed. Branches corresponding to partitions reproduced in less than 50% bootstrap replicates are collapsed. The percentage of replicate trees in which the associated taxa clustered together in the bootstrap test (250 replicates) is shown next to the branches. The tree is drawn to scale, with branch lengths in the same units as those of the evolutionary distances used to infer the phylogenic tree. The evolutionary distances were computed using the Maximum Composite Likelihood method and are in the units of the number of base substitutions per site. All positions containing gaps and missing data were eliminated from the dataset (Complete deletion option). There were a total of 7106 positions in the final dataset. Phylogenetic analyses were conducted in MEGA4 (9)."
