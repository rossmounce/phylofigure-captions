"pone.0057338.g005.png","Neighbor-joining consensus tree and expression patterns of TCP genes.(a) Unrooted protein tree for the TCP protein domain data set produced using MEGA 4.0.1 [73]. The tree summarizes the evolutionary relationships among the 24 AtTCPs[41], 16 VsTCPs, and other representative sequences. The bootstrap values are denoted above the nodes; bootstrap values of less than 50 are not shown on the phylogenetic tree. The representative sequences include OsPCF1 (NP_001052212) and OsPCF2 (NP_001062409) in rice; ZmTB1 (AF377742) in maize; and AmCYC (Y16313) in snapdragon. (b) The expression patterns of the TCP genes in vetch organs. The abbreviations for the different tissues are the same as in Figure 1."
