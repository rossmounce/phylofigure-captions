Phylogenetic analysis of VP1 bat rotavirus-related sequences.(A) Schematic representation of the VP1 segment (almost 3,300 nt encoding the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of almost 1,090 aa) of the genome of the lamb rotavirus strain Lamb-NT (GenBank number FJ031024), with black bars corresponding to the longest contig sequences (>300 nt) of the bat rotavirus (named Maule rotavirus) identified in specimen b8 (Myotis mystacinus). The genomic region amplified by PCR is represented by a dashed bar, and the sequence used for phylogenetic analysis is indicated with an asterisk. B) Phylogenetic tree produced from the amino-acid alignment based on the partial VP1 sequence (119 aa, positions 964 to 1082 of the VP1 protein of lamb rotavirus strain Lamb-NT) translated from one of the longest HSPs. The bat rotavirus-related sequence is indicated in bold within the various rotavirus groups. The scale bar indicates branch length, and bootstrap values â‰¥70% are shown next to the relevant nodes. The tree is midpoint-rooted for purposes of clarity only."
