Maximum-likelihood (ML) phylogeny of P. geminatum ( = C. geminatum) with other dinoflagellates inferred from 18S+28S rDNA concatenated data.Sequences obtained in this study are bold-typed. Support of nodes is based on bootstrap values of ML with 1000 resamplings. Only values greater than 60 are shown. Oxyrrhis marina was used as the outgroup to root the tree. Note that P. geminatum is grouped with the other species of Polykrikos with strong support."
