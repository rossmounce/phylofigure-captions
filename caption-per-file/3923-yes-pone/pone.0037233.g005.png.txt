"pone.0037233.g005.png","Example phylogenetic trees showing loss of pre-extinction history during and after press episode, from a replicate population that maintained the pre-extinction phylogenetic root.Node labels are Avida genotype IDs. Branch lengths are scaled in Avida absolute time. a) Immediate pre-extinction tree. Clades highlighted in yellow are lost during press episode; clades highlighted in red survive press episode but are lost during recovery. Clades highlighted in blue are those that comprise the tree in panel c). Organisms in clades D, E, F, G contain same phenotypic profiles as those in clade C (not shown due to space constraints). b) Tree from end of press episode. Clades highlighted in red are lost during recovery. c) Tree from 2000 updates into recovery after press episode (107,000 updates). d) Control tree from 107,000 updates, showing retention of clades that were otherwise lost in the press extinction and recovery."
