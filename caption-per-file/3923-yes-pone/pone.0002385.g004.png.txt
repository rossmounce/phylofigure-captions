Three phylogenetic subtree types of a phylogenetic tree consisting of 2 species (sp.1 and sp.2).Genes derived from intraspecific duplications are considered to be one gene. Type-A indicates that a gene is found in both sp.1 and sp.2 lineages. Type-B indicates that orthologous genes of a gene of sp.1 are not found in sp.2. Type-C indicates that orthologous genes of a gene of sp.2 are not found in sp.1. (a) An imaginary tree of a multigene family in two species (sp.1 and sp.2). It can be resolved into two type-A subtrees, one type-B subtree and one type-C subtree."
