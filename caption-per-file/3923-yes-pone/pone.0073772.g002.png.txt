"pone.0073772.g002.png","Evolution of YIP3 in fungi.The presence (species in black) and absence of the 3′ ORFs (species in grey) of YIP3 was mapped on the most probable phylogenetic tree of the Eumycota [43], [46]. The most parsimonious scenario of evolution is a single appearance of the 3′ ORF after the split of the Orbiliomycetes from the other Pezizomycotina (slanted arrow) and a secondary loss in A. apis (cross). * denotes the two groups for which a+1 frameshift is hypothesized and ×2 the species in which a duplication of YIP3 has occurred."
