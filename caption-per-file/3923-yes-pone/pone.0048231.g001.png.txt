Phyloecological cluster tree of Archaea.A. The cluster tree was built with average linkage of distances based on correlation metric by using the 5-features subset. Cut-off distance for the formation of clusters was 1.0. The tree is divided into three main phyloecological clusters. The first cluster (highlighted in yellow) is comprised of hyperthermophilic species, non-halophilic or halotolerant, and aerobic hyperthermoacidophiles. The members of the second cluster (highlighted in blue) are halophilic and extremely halophilic Archaea, growing in the various temperature ranges (mesophilic, thermophilic or hyperthermophilic values), and conditions of neutral pH or alkaliphilic. The third cluster (highlighted in red) contains mesophilic (mostly methanogens) and thermoacidophilic Archaea, non-halophiles or halotolerant. B. Leaves of the tree display names of phyla for each species from A."
