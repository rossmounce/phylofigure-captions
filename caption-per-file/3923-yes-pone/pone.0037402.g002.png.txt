"pone.0037402.g002.png","Molecular analysis of HIV-1 transmission in 46 HIV-1 concordant couples.(A) Maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree. All individual sequences are labeled by their couple number followed by M (male partner) or F (female partner). Female partners in polygamous partnerships are labeled as F1 and F2. Bootstrap values are calculated from 500 replicates; values of 50% or more are shown. Sequences from partners of the same couple are colored in blue if they cluster with a bootstrap value of 80% or more; in green if they cluster with a bootstrap value below 80%; in red if they are on separate branches of the tree. HIV-1 subtypes are shown on the main branches of the tree, HIV-1 reference sequences are omitted. The scale represents the maximum-likelihood genetic distance. (B) Maximum-likelihood genetic distances. Distance values between sequences of male and female partners of the same couple are shown. Bars correspond to the pairs of clustered or non-clustered sequences as they appear in the phylogenetic tree in panel A. Distance values between pairs of non-clustered sequences are shown for only one of the two sequences; the other sequence is labeled “id.” (idem). The dotted line represents the distance cut-off value for linked sequences which is set at 0.04."
