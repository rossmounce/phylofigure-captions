"pone.0029817.g006.png","Schematic presentation of the origin, evolution and lineage-specific losses of the five main GRAFS families, cAMP receptor family and the Fungi kingdom specific GPCRs. The eukaryotic evolutionary tree is constructed with references from the tree of life Web project (http://tolweb.org/tree/phylogeny.html). Each branch shows the presence (colored circles) and the loss (colored cross symbol) of the five main GRAFS families and the cAMP receptor family. The presence and absence of the N-terminal domains of the Glutamate and the Adhesion family is indicated with a tick mark and a crossed circle, respectively. The presence of Fungi kingdom specific GPCRs were represented by colored star symbols, and their absence with a line segment in black against the respective colored star symbol. The putative connection and origin of the Glutamate and cAMP receptor family is indicated with dotted lines at the bottom. The horizontal gene transfer of the Adhesion receptor family from Fungi to Alveolata is indicated with dotted lines in red. Branch lengths are not drawn to represent actual evolutionary distances."
