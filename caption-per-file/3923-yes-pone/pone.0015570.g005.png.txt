Molecular phylogeny of 5.8S rRNAs for OTUs detected in the culture-independent investigation. Topologies of NJ and MP trees are almost identical, and only the NJ tree is shown here. The tree is based on a total of 153 sequences (118 OTUs detected in the culture-independent investigation, 32 closest database matches of these OTUs and three outgroup sequences from GenBank) and 152 unambiguous nucleotide positions. OTUs are indicated by the name of representative clones and GenBank accession numbers. Those 35 GenBank records are shown as they are annotated in the database, including their accession numbers. Solid diamonds indicate branches receiving more than 70% bootstrap values; solid circles represent potential new lineages; solid triangles represent OTUs that have a total abundance of more than 2%; solid stars indicate OTUs detected simultaneously from stromata (or sclerotia) and mycelial cortices of natural O. sinensis specimens."
