Calibrated phylogeny of oviraptorosaurian theropods showing hypothesized position of Anzu wyliei gen. et sp. nov.Depicted topology is the strict consensus of seven most parsimonious trees of 498 steps resulting from an analysis of 34 taxa (31 oviraptorosaurs) scored for 230 morphological characters (Figure 6B). Numbers adjacent to each node are Bremer support values; named nodes are indicated with black dots. Thick black bars indicate stratigraphic ranges of each taxon; small crossbars at ends of some bars indicate taxa that are especially poorly stratigraphically constrained (e.g., most Asian Late Cretaceous forms). Time scale follows [98]. Sources for stratigraphic ranges of included taxa are provided in Table S9 in File S1."
