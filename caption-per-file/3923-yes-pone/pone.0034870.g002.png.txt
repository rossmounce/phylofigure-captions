"pone.0034870.g002.png","Clustering of human Rab proteins according to sequence and to electrostatic potential similarity.A (left): Unrooted phylogenetic tree based on a Gblocked alignment of the sequences. The tree shows six subclusters. The color coding corresponds to the sequence-based phylogenetic analysis by Colicelli (Colicelli, 2004). For a phylogenetic tree derived from analysis of the full-length sequences, see File S1. B (right): Epogram. The proteins are clustered according to their distance in electrostatic potential space, , where SIab is the pairwise Hodgkin similarity index (Hodgkin and Richards, 1987) calculated for the complete protein skin. The electrostatic potential distance clustering suggests six subclusters with a different composition from the sequence-based analysis."
