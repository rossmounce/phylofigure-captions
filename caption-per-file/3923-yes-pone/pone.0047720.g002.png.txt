Phylogeny of LuxR and LuxI homologs.a) A phylogenetic tree of LuxR homologs. Only bootstrap values of ?50 are displayed. A maximum likelihood tree gave similar results (not shown). Blue lines indicate species that contain a solo sdiA. Green lines indicate species that contain sdiA and an adjacent luxI homolog. Pink lines indicate species that contain rhlR. b) A phylogenetic tree of LuxI protein sequences. Only bootstrap values of ?50 are displayed. A maximum likelihood tree gave similar results (not shown). Green lines indicate species that contain sdiA and an adjacent luxI homolog. Pink lines indicate species that contain rhlR."
