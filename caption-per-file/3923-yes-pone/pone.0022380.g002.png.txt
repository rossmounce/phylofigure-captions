"pone.0022380.g002.png","Phylogenetic trees based on nc- and mt-datasets. The datasets comprises mitochondrial sequences of ND2 and over 2000 AFLP markers for (a) Steatocranus and (b) Nanochromis. Black numbers at nodes refer to bootstrap-values (BS, 1000 pseudo-replicates) of the ML run (right side) or the neighbour joining tree (left side). Filled circles represent a 100% BS support. Major groups within the phylogeny are marked with coloured frames. Species that are placed differently in AFLP and mt-trees are marked in red. The red frames in Nanochromis trees indicate differences in sistergroup-ralationships."
