Radial phylogenetic tree of the hard tick lipocalin family.The tree was constructed by neighbor-joining analysis. Sequence names correspond to species abbreviations: I. scapularis (Isca), I. pacificus (Ipac), R. appendiculatus (Rapp), D. reticulatus (Dret), B. microplus (Bmic), H. longicornis (Hlon), O. moubata (Omou), O. savignyi (Osav), A. monolakensis (Amon), A. reflexus (Aref) followed by their Genbank accession number. Red squares indicate histamine-binding proteins, blue squares 5-HT-binding proteins, mixed red and blue squares histamine and 5-HT-binding proteins, yellow squares cysteinyl-binding proteins, orange squares LTB4-binding proteins and mixed orange and gray squares LTB4 and TXA2-binding proteins. Other sequences are of unknown function. LIRs are shown in bold, and lipocalins from soft ticks are indicated in green."
