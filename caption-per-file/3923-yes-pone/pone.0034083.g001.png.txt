Sequencing phylogeny of study NTHi isolates. Radiation trees are presented for (A) 598 bases of the 16S rRNA gene, (B) 545 bases of the recA gene, and (C) the concatenation of these sequences (1143 bases). The trees are rooted by H. parainfluenzae T3T1 as indicated by yellow dots. Blue dots represent isolates that cluster with H. influenzae reference strains, orange dots represent closely related phylogenetic variants, red dots represent likely Hh isolates and green dots represent variants related to H. parainfluenzae. Colours were assigned based on the phylogenetic grouping of the concatenated sequences in radial tree C."
