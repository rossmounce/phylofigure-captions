"pone.0071732.g002.png","Phylogenetic tree analysis of genes containing arrestin-like domains.A phylogenetic tree was constructed using the neighbor-joining method [51]. Known arrestin genes and other genes that encode proteins with arrestin-like domains of Apis mellifera (Bee-) Drosophila melanogaster (Fly-), Caenorhabditis elegans, (c. elegans-)and Homo sapiens (human-) origin are indicated by the pink and orange background color, respectively. The scale bar corresponds to 0.1 substitutions/site."
