Evolution of Bracovirus histone, ep2 and CrV1 genes in different Cotesia sesamiae populations.(A) Evolution of the histone gene: on the left, CsBV histone tree; on the right, genetic map showing the alignment of different isoforms, lines indicated the presence of deletions between boxed regions; (B) ep2 (left) and CrV1 (right) trees; lines between trees indicate the genotypes for which the 2 genes have different histories. Each genotype was assigned a color based on its main phylogenetic affiliation: purple?=?histone isoform b, orange?=?histone isoform c, pink?=?histone isoform d, green?=?ep2 CskBV clade, light blue?=?CrV1 CsmBV clade, and black?=?unassigned (refer to Table S1 for sampling details). Phylogenetic clustering is based on HKY genetic distance; ** and * indicate bootstrap support above 75 and 50 respectively; colored branches indicate results from Branch site REL analyses (HYPHY): in red with dN/dS >5 and in blue dN/dS?=?0."
