"pone.0021989.g001.png","Myxococcal ancestry of eukaryotic proteins. Bayesian phylogenetic trees of (i) the isocitrate dehydrogenase 3 NAD(+) alpha, beta and gamma genes, (ii) the acyl-CoA dehydrogenase C-2 to C-3 short chain gene (ACADS), and (iii) acetyl-CoA acyltransferase 2 (ACAA2). The Bayesian posterior probability (PP) until convergence diagnostic and 1000-replicate bootstrap values (BV) for ML trees are indicated if they were above 50%. A black dot indicates PP>0.95. Eukaryotic, myxococcal/δ-proteobacterial and α-proteobacterial taxa are highlighted in blue, red and green, respectively."
