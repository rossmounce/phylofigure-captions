Phylogenetic analysis of the HBV isolates circulating among the HIV/HBV co-infected population of eastern India.The phylogenetic tree was constructed based on the complete small S region (nucleotide 155?835 from EcoRI site) of the HBV genome using the neighbor-joining method and bootstrap value of 1000 replicates. The 39 isolates (denoted by EICIS) were analyzed with respect to 42 reference sequences retrieved from the GenBank which are designated by their respective accession numbers along with their HBV genotypes/subgenotypes and country of origin. ? represents isolates belonging to HBV/A, ? represents HBV/C whereas ? represents HBV/D."
