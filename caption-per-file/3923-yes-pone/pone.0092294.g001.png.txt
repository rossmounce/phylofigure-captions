Maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree based on multiple sequence alignment of 16S rRNA genes of the isolate Pontibacter diazotrophicus sp. nov. H4XT and other closely related type strains.Bootstrap values (expressed as percentages of 1000 replicates) that are >75% are shown at branch points. Asterisks indicate that the corresponding nodes were also recovered in the Bayesian tree. Bar, 0.01 substitutions per nucleotide position."
