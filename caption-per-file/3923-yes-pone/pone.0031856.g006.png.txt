"pone.0031856.g006.png","Bayesian phylogenetic tree of fungal and bacterial Sgbs. Bayesian tree based on a T-COFFEE 9.01 alignment of 51 fungal, 57 bacterial (including 16 Pgbs), one rotifer and one heterolobosan Sgbs, using two Adgb sequences [16] as outgroup. Support values at branches represent Bayesian posterior probabilities (>0.5). The sequences are identified by the first three letters of the binary species name, the number of residues, and the full phylum and family names (see Table S1)."
