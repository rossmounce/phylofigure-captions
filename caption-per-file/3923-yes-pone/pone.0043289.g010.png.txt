Phylogenetic tree of gC1q domains from different C1qDC proteins.The tree is constructed by the neighbor-joining (NJ) algorithm using the Mega 3.1 program based on the multiple sequence alignment by ClustalW. The reliability of the branching is tested by bootstrap re-sampling (1000 pseudo-replicates). The gC1q domain sequences used for phylogenetic analysis are as follows: Human C1q-A (NP_057075), Human C1q-B (NP_000482), Human C1q-C (NP_758957), Mouse C1q-A (NP_031598), Mouse C1q-B (NP_033907), Mouse C1q-C (NP_031600), LC1q (BAD22833), CcC1q-like (BAD22535), AmphiC1q (ACH95418), HmC1q (ACC69183), AiC1qDC-2 (GU475114), MgC1q (FN563147), CfC1qDC (EF536358) and AiC1qDC-1 (GU475113)."
