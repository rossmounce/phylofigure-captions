Majority rule consensus phylogenetic tree of Actinobacterial Dps orthologous proteins.Maximum-likelihood reconstructed phylogenetic tree of Actinobacterial Dps proteins. Indicated are three orthologous protein clusters (shaded boxes). DpsASc, DpsBSc and DpsCSc indicates the position of S. coelicolor Dps in the tree. Paralogous gene pairs of DpsB in Streptomyces are indicated using matched Roman numerals. ÏƒB indicates those proteins where a putative sigB-like promoter was identified. Bootstrap values >60% are indicated next to major nodes."
