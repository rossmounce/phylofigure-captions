"pone.0062552.g004.png","Genetic distances and phylogenetic tree constructed using a maximum-likelihood method from concatenated regions of HIV RNA (indicated by black circles) and proviral DNA (indicated by black squares) marked with Arabic numbers 1 and 2 from patient 010BR_IMT_020 along with HIV-1 reference sequences from the Los Alamos HIV-1 database representing 11 genetic subtypes.For purposes of clarity, the tree was midpoint rooted. The approximate likelihood ratio test (aLRT) values of ?70% are indicated at nodes. The scale bar represents 0.05 nucleotide substitutions per site."
