"pone.0032139.g006.png","MEGA 4.0.2-derived phylogenetic relationships between sequences within the ITS T1-0.05 dataset at the FastGroupII-defined OTU level (unrooted ME trees, 100 bootstrap replicates, K2P model). Bootstrap values >50 are highlighted. OTU names include the genus, number of sequences, and most relevant BLAST hit(s) with NCBI annotation(s): a = near Naucoria escharoides AY900084, b = near Rhizoctonia sp. Eab-S1 AJ242881, c = near Ganoderma lipsiense EF060006, d = near Russula cyanoxantha AY606960, e = near R. sp. MHM078 EU569265, f = near R. farinipes DQ421983, g = near Cryptococcus podzolicus AJ581036, h = near Hygrocybe aff. conica PBM 918 AY854074. Singleton OTUs are denoted by thick pale branch lines; multisequence OTUs are represented as blocks (their widths correspond to their maximum internal distance)."
