"pone.0050507.g004.png","Maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree of the 236 different nifH gene sequences obtained from GeoChip 3.0 analysis.The width of each wedge is the number of nifH sequences within each cluster. The percentages and numbers in each bracket are the signal proportions and detected gene numbers of each cluster within each depth, respectively. The significant differences of gene abundance were analyzed by one-way ANOVA."
