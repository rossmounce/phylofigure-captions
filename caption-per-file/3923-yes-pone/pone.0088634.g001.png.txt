Neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree showing the relationship of g20 amino acid sequences from paddy floodwaters in NE China with those from Japanese paddy floodwaters (Wang et al. 2010) and paddy field soils (Wang et al.2011).Brown and white square boxes indicate g20 clones obtained from paddy field soils in Japan and paddy floodwaters in Japan, respectively; green triangles indicate g20 clones obtained from paddy floodwaters in NE China; JP and CN represent Japan and China, respectively; PFW and PFS represent paddy floodwater and paddy field soil, respectively. Bootstrap values <50 are not shown. The scale bar represents the number of amino acid substitutions per residue."
