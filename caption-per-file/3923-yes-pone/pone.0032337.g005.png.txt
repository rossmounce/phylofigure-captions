An unrooted phylogram shows the relationship between 5′ regions of modA genes (ATG to repeat, 410 nt). Phylogram of the 410 nt modA 5′ nucleotide sequence produced using the Neighbor-joining algorithm, as implemented in PHYLIP [32]. Taxa that do not cluster according to their cognate mod allele are highlighted: N. meningitidis and N. gonorrhoeae modA11 (red), modA12 (purple) and modA13 (green). Bootstrap values from 1000 replications are shown as percentages for nodes with more than 50% support. Scale bar shows distances in nucleotide substitutions per site."
