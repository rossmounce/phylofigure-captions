The neighbor-joining consensus tree illustrates the phylogenetic relationship of ClCPR with other insect CPRs. The phylogenetic tree was generated by MEGA 5 according to the amino acid sequences. All nodes have significant bootstrap support based on 2,000 replicates. All insects CPRs were clustered into six groups which was six insect orders. The CPRs from bed bug (Cimex lectularius) and body louse (Pediculus humanus corporis) which showed the closest evolutionary relationship with ClCPR were highlighted in black boxes."
