Domain architecture and phylogenetic analysis of whitefly Argonaute2 protein.(A) Comparative domain architecture of whitefly Argonaute2 with other insects and C. elegans. Both PAZ and PIWI domains are present in all the analysed sequences. (B) Alignment of PAZ domain with other insects and C. elegans sequences. Figure shows high degree of homology between aligned sequences. Triangles indicate the presence of signature sequences responsible for efficient binding with siRNA [40]. Almost all the signature sequences are present in whitefly. (C) Phylogenetic analysis of whitefly Argonaute2 with other insects and C. elegans. Tree was constructed on the basis of full length sequence. Figure shows that the whitefly Argonaute2 clustered with N. lugens and aphids showing high homology between them. Similar result is observed in multiple sequence alignment (File S3)."
