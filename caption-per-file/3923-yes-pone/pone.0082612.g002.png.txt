Phylogenetic position of Profftella LysE in related transporter proteins.A total of 185 unambiguously aligned amino acid sites were subjected to the analysis. A maximum likelihood phylogeny is shown, whereas a Bayesian analysis inferred essentially the same result. On each node, support values of maximum-likelihood analysis/Bayesian posterior probabilities are shown. Scale bar indicates substitutions per site. Source organisms are shown with higher bacterial taxa in brackets. ?, ?, and ? indicate classes of the Proteobacteria, respectively. Accession numbers of proteins are shown in parentheses. The Profftella-Liberibacter cluster is highlighted in red."
