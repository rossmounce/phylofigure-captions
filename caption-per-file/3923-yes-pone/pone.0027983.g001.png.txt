Maximum likelihood phylogeny of Ostreopsis inferred from D8/D10 sequence aligned with ClustalW. Tree is rooted with Coolia as outgroup but pruned for simplify. See Fig. S1 for original topology. Major clades found in Japanese coast are particularly noted as clade Aâ€“D, and their subclades are also indicated (e.g. A-1, A-2). Nodes with strong supports (bt/pp) are shown as thick lines. Sequences shared with more than one clone has been removed for phylogenetic analysis leaving 1 sequence as a representative of a ribotype. *Ribotype containing many clones are separately displayed at left hand. **Clone (currently being) used for various experiments."
