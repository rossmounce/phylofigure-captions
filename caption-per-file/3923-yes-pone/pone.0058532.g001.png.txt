"pone.0058532.g001.png","Evolutionary history of TRIM5 and the primate species involved in this study.(A) Graphical depiction of the TRIM6/34/5/22 genomic locus of primates as well as a depiction of the hypothetical ancestral mammalian genomic locus. (B) Phylogenetic tree showing the evolutionary relationship of primate species representative of the most prominent genera of primate evolution. The following species were examined in this study: human (Homo sapiens), chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes), white-cheeked gibbon (Nomascus leucogenys), olive baboon (Papio anubis), rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta), guereza colobus (Colobus guereza), Peruvian red-necked owl monkey (Aotus nancymaae), common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), Bolivian squirrel monkey (Saimiri boliviensis boliviensis), dusky titi (Callicebus moloch), and grey mouse lemur (Microcebus murinus). These species are highlighted using ‘*’ as well as bold lettering. This phylogenetic tree was adapted from Bininda-Emonds et al. 2007, and uses the revised dates published with the corrigendum on the original article."
