Distribution of pOENI-1 genes in 44 O. oeni strains.The dendrogram was constructed from DNA banding patterns obtained by NotI-PFGE analysis of 44 O. oeni strains. Oenococcus kitaharae was used as outgroup. Strain S11 was positioned on the basis of MLST data since no NotI-PFGE pattern was obtained for this strain. The presence (filled square) or absence (empty squares) of plasmid genes repA, tauE, oye and of the chromosomal gene OEOE_0812 were determined by PCR. The presence/absence of a region encompassing the oye and parB genes was also investigated. IOEB: Institute of oenology of Bordeaux, S: SARCO, ATCC: American type culture collection. Indutrial strains are marked with asterisks. Letters A and B in the dendrogram represent two phylogenetic groups of strains [36]."
