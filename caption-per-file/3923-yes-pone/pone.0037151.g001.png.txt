"pone.0037151.g001.png","Conservation of the mammalian and Drosophila Ets networks.(A) Schematic representation of the Drosophila and Mammalian Ets Networks. Activated MAPK (dpERK) phosphorylates Yan (TEL1) and PntP2 (ETS1/2) to inhibit transcriptional repression of target genes by Yan and to potentiate transcriptional activation by PntP2 respectively. Mae negatively regulates Yan and PntP2 to modulate signaling by the RTK network. Similarly, TEL2SAM negatively regulates the transcriptional activity of the vertebrate orthologs TEL1 and ETS1/2. (B) Sequence alignment of the SAM domains of Yan, TEL1, TEL2, Mae, PntP2, ETS1 and ETS2. Amino acids that are identical in at least four of the seven proteins are in bold, grey boxes highlight critical residues that mediate EH-ML surface interactions, and the asterisks indicate the specific residues mutated in the TEL2SAMEHmut and TEL2SAMMLmut constructs. (C) Dendrogram analysis using the sequences in (B) shows the phylogenetic relationships of the SAM domains."
