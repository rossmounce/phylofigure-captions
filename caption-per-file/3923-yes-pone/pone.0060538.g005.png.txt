Non-rooted phylogenetic tree of GH3 family glycosidases.Enzyme names are shown with their DDBJ/EMBL/Genbank accession numbers (parenthesized). The tree was constructed from a CLUSTALW program multiple alignment [32] using a neighbor joining method [33]. Bar?=?0.1 amino acid substitutions/site. Numbers indicate bootstrap values greater than 800. Known clusters (clusters 1?6) of GH3 family [23] are shown with gray circles."
