Phylogenetic tree of 18S rRNA gene sequences retrieved from PPEs sorted by flow cytometry in the South East Pacific (in bold blue) inferred by maximum likelihood (ML) analysis.Sequences representative of OTUs are labelled with a dot. Clade nomenclatures follow references [19], [29] for Prasinophyceae, [51] for Chrysophyceae and [32] for Haptophyta. The tree is inferred from 1,622 positions of an alignment of 124 full-length sequences with two outgroup sequences (fungi). The phylogenetic tree was based on a TrN+I+G model of DNA substitution with a gamma distribution shape parameter of 0.5833 and substitution rates of R(b)[A–G] = 2.5256, R(e)[C–T] = 4.3865 and 1.0 for all other substitution rates. The total number of rearrangements tried was 70,412. Bootstrap values over 50% are indicated on the internal branches obtained from both NJ and MP methods."
