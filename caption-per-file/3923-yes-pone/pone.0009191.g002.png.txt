"pone.0009191.g002.png","Molecular phypogeny of H. jecorina sensu lato.Bayesian circular phylogram inferred from the concatenated dataset of tef1, cal1 and las1 phylogenetic markers. Symbols at nodes correspond to posterior probabilities (PP) >95%. Filled circles correspond to PP in the concatenated tree, open stars, squares and polygons to PP in las1, cal1 and tef1 gene trees, respectively. The corresponding phylograms are given in Figure S1. The color code indicates the geographic region from which the isolates were obtained, as explained in the right top inset."
