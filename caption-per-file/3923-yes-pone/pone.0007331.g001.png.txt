The Moyeni trackway locality and its stratigraphic and phylogenetic context.The thumbnail map of Africa shows areal extent of main Karoo Basin (grey) and the country of Lesotho (yellow). The phylogeny depicts the basic interrelationships of major dinosaur clades [41] on a timescale. Subsequent analyses have resolved Lesothosaurus at the base of Thyreophora [45], but most agree that it is positioned near the base of clade uniting Thyreophora, Ornithopoda, and Marginocephalia. The Moyeni tracksite (marked by yellow band) preserves tracks made by early dinosaur trackmakers, well after the initial divergence of saurischians and ornithischians (early Late Triassic) but well before the origin of flight (Upper Jurassic) and prior to three independent acquisitions of quadrupedal posture (Earlyâ€“Middle Jurassic) [41], [42]. The graded stratigraphic range for Marginocephalia reflects uncertainty in its first appearance date; icons atop diagram are representative theropod and ornithischian dinosaurs [41]."
