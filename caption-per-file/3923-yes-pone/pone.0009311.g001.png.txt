Bayesian tree of HIV-1 subtype C pol sequences.Evolutionary relationships between 54 United Kingdom, 87 Brazilian and 120 non-Brazilian subtype C pol sequences, estimated using Bayesian phylogenetic analysis, are shown. Colors on terminal branches and terminal nodes indicate the geographic location of sampling, as shown in the key (bottom right). Asterisks indicate nodes with posterior probability values of 0.95 or higher. Brackets indicate clades comprised of sequences sampled from a specific geographic region, and with posterior probability values above 0.95. The mean dates of the most recent common ancestors to the ‘UK and Brazil’ and ‘UK-MSM’ clades are indicated alongside the corresponding internal nodes (white circles). Note that the majority (n = 8,266, >99%) of the UK subtype C sequences examined in this report grouped within the ‘Africa and Asia’ clade in preliminary analysis and are not shown here."
