Phylogenies of plastid genomes of green algae, euglenids and Bigelowiella based on 70 genes. A. This phylogenetic tree was constructed using the maximum likelihood method implemented in RAxML, using the LG+I+G model selected by ProtTest. The bootstraps were estimated in 500 replicates. B. This tree was constructed in Beast v 1.6.1 using the WAG+I+Î“ model of substitution and an uncorrelated exponential model of relaxed molecular clock. MCMCs were run for 10*106 generations; trees from the first 2*106 generations were discarded as the burn-in. Node labels represent posterior probabilities, node bars represent the 95% confidence interval of relative node ages."
