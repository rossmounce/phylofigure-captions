Unrooted phylogenic trees for the NS5A protein sequences of all variants identified in the 27 patients included in the study. The 5 patients in green had a LD area 2 per 50,000 µm2 of liver tissue. The 6 patients in red had a LD area >10,000 µm2 per 50,000 µm2 of tissue. The remaining 16 patients, with steatosis of intermediate severity, are shown in black. Diversity in individual patients is represented by a triangle at the top of the branches, with the magnitude of the diversity observed increasing with the area of the triange. Bootstrap values exceeding 75% are shown (numbers in dark blue). Scale bars indicate evolutionary distance (0.01 indicates 10 mutations for every 1000 residues). Patients are grouped according to viral genotype. Patients with little or no steatosis (green) and those with severe (red) steatosis are evenly distributed over these phylogenic trees. No clustering according to steatosis status was observed."
