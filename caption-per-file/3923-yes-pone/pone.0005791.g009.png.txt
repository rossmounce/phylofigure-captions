"pone.0005791.g009.png","Schematic representation of the phylogeny of the B3 superfamily during plant evolution.Circles with a number inside denote large-scale duplication events: 1, ∼143–220 MYA [52]; 2, ∼66–109 MYA [50], [51]; 3, ∼50–60 MYA [39], [50]; 4, ∼30–60 MYA [53], ∼24–40 MYA [38]; and 6, ∼8–13 MYA [40]. Solid black circles denote recent tandem duplication for B3 genes discovered in this study. The solid black squares, family or class names denote origin of the B3 families during evolution."
