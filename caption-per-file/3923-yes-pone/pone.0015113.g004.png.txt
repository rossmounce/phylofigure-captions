"pone.0015113.g004.png","Phylogenetic analysis of ChpPV with the other 17 representative parvoviruses in each genus of Parvovirinae. Genome sequences (A), NS1 (B) and VP1 (C) amino acid sequences of representative members in each genus of the subfamily Parvovirinae were used to determine the neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree using BioEdit Version 7. Genbank accession numbers of the sequences used follow the name of the virus."
