"pone.0029398.g003.png","Phylogenetic relationship of D. miles with other dinoflagellates inferred from SSU rDNA. Sequence obtained in this study is bold-typed. Support of nodes is based on bootstrap values of ML/NJ with 1000 and 500 resamplings, respectively. Only values greater than 60 are shown. If only one of the two phylogenetic methods yielded significant support, the other is shown with “-”. Cryptophyta sp. was used as the outgroup to root the tree. In this tree, D. miles cannot be separated from D. norvegica and D. caudata."
