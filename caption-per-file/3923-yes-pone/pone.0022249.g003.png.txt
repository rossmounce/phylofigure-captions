"pone.0022249.g003.png","Phylogenetic tree of mating-type specific and non mating-type specific pheromone receptor protein sequences. The tree shows phylogeny amongst pheromone receptor proteins from F. velutipes (Fv), C. cinerea (Cc), L. bicolor (Lb), S. commune (Sc), P. djamor (Pd) and C. neoformans (Cn). Nodal supports with more than 70% bootstrap values are considered strongly supported and displayed in the tree. Known mating-type specific pheromone receptors are depicted in blue. Two major clades are distinguished, labeled A and B. The four non mating-type specific pheromone receptors of F. velutipes FvSte3.s1 to FvSte3.s5 (pseudogene FvSTE3.s2 was excluded) form a separate group (shaded purple) within clade B that is supported by strong branch values. The clade including FvSte3.1 and two other known mating-type specific pheromone receptors is shaded in orange. The clade that contains FvSte3.2 is shaded in yellow. Both these clades are supported by strong branch values. FvSte3.1 and FvSte3.2 group closest with SCBbr1 and SCBbr2, respectively. Clades that contain known mating-type specific pheromone receptors are strong evidence for mating-type specificity of other clade members. LbSte3.5 is a notable exception."
