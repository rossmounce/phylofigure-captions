"pone.0077175.g001.png","Phylogenetic tree of mtDNA HVRI region and allele sharing matrix of mtDNA and autosomes.(A) The phylogenetic tree among human, chimpanzee, Bornean (red) and Sumatran (blue). The nodes shaded in cyan represent the grouping of the three Sumatran individuals that has the furthest distance to the rest clustering of the Sumatran group. The 10 re-sequenced individuals from our study are colored as red (Bornean) or blue (Sumatran). The corresponding geographic origins are shown on the right with the following annotation (SU: Sumatran; TU/SL: Tuanan or Sungai Lading; DV/K: Danum Valley or Kinabatangan; SA/GP: Sabangau or Gunung Palung; EK: East Kalimantan including Kutai national park or Sangatta; SAR/DS: Semongok Wildlife Rehabilitation Centre or Danau Sentarum). (B) The IBS allele sharing matrix among the 10 individuals from our study with the same group coloring scheme. The upper and lower triangular matrix represents the IBS sharing of all mtDNA variation loci (n?=?1084) and autosomal variation loci (n?=?11,866,619), respectively."
