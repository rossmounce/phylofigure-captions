Maximum likelihood tree showing the phylogenetic relationships for the Centromochlus existimatus species complex.Phylogenetic relationships are inferred from the concatenated data set including mitochondrial ATPase 6 and 8 genes and the nuclear RAG1 gene. Numbers below branches are the posterior probabilities based on Bayesian inference and bootstrap support values based on Maximum likelihood analysis."
