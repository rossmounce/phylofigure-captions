The salivary disintegrins 40â€“270 family of Amblyomma maculatum. (A) Alignment indicating conserved cysteines in black background, RGD motif in blue background, and blue bar above the sequences indicating the signal peptide indicative of secretion. The symbols at the bottom indicate (*) identity of residues, (:) conserved, and (.) less conserved residues. (B) Bootstrapped phylogram of the alignment in (A). The numbers at the nodes indicate the bootstrap support, and the bar at the bottom indicates 2% amino acid divergence."
