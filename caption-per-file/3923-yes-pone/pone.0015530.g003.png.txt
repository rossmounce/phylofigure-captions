Phylogenetic tree of the Transcription factor II B (TFIIB). The TFIIB phylogenetic tree is inferred with Bayesian approach from a cured alignment of 32 sequences (155 conserved positions) from the Eukarya (blue), Archaea (green), NCLDVs (red), and metagenomic databases (black). Bayesian posterior probabilities are mentioned near branches as a percentage and are used as confidence values of tree branches. Scale bar represents the number of estimated changes per position for a unit of branch length."
