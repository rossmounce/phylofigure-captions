"pone.0050116.g003.png","Maximum likelihood (ML) phylogenetic trees for the 8 influenza genetic segments.ML trees from 136 to 162 A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses registered in GenBank were produced with 1,000 bootstrap replicates, for the indicated genetic segments as explained in the Methods section. The four 2012 Mexican fully sequenced by next generation sequencing are included. Red dots at nodes show branches with >50% bootstrap support leading to the 2012 sequences described in this work. Branches are colored according to WHO influenza transmission zones [13]."
