Phylogenetic relationships of Kataria anisodonta.Temporally calibrated cladogram of the most parsimonious tree obtained in this analysis. Thick gray lines indicate stratigraphic range of known taxa (dashed area indicates that these records are based on vertebral remains). Dashed lines represent ghost lineages implied by the stratigraphic distribution of fossils with respect to the phylogenetic relationships shown here (note the exceptionally abundant ghost lineages for Macrostomata). Ages of first appearance for taxa used in the calibrated phylogeny are given in electronic supplementary material. Al, Albian; Ce, Cenomanian; Tu, Turonian; Co, Coniacian; Sa, Santonian; Cam, Campanian; Ma, Maastrichtian; Pal, Paleocene; Eoc, Eocene; Oli, Oligocene; Mi, Miocene; Pl-Ple, Plio-Pleistocene."
