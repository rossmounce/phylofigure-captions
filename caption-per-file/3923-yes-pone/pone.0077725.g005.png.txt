Bayesian phylogenetic tree (GTR+G model) showing the phylogenetic position of 140 partial 5.8S rDNA, ITS2 and LSU rDNA sequences of Symbiodinium.The 56 sequences obtained for this study are marked by their DNA isolate numbers. Numbers at nodes indicate (from left to right) posterior probabilities (BI) and bootstrap values (ML). The tree was rooted with Protodinium, Polarella and Pelagodinium."
