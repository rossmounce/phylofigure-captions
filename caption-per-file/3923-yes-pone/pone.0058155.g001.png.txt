Phylogenetic relationships of 154 CC121 isolates.Maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree based on 304 SNPs ascertained in 115 genetic loci (47 kb total) and annotated with the country of origin and year of isolation. The continent of origin is indicated by the color of the isolate's name: blue, Europe; orange, Asia; green, Oceania; red, North America; yellow, South America; black, Africa. Bootstrap values are shown where ?85%. The scale bar represents substitutions per SNP site. Asterisks indicate isolates selected for whole-genome sequencing. The European epidemic fusidic acid-resistant impetigo clone (EEFIC) was identified on the basis of fusidic acid resistance, PCR detection of the fusB gene, spa typing (t171), and MLST (ST123)."
