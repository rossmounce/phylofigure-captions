"pone.0018528.g004.png","Phylogeny. A) Phylogeny of the CA3427 homologs in Fungi. The reference list of fungal species is from [23]. Multiple strains of the same species have been removed for clarity. The CA3427 sequence (in red in all trees) is from C. albicans strain SC5314. This unrooted tree was computed on the Phylogeny.fr web server [30], using the default option of the “advanced mode” w/o Gblocks. The final alignment includes 209 ungapped positions. Branch support estimates are indicated in red, and branches have been collapsed for values [23]. No species from the WGD clade (e.g. Saccharomyces cerevisiae) appear to possess a CA3427-like protein. B) Evolutionary relationships between the bacterial PBPs and their eukaryotic CA3427-like homolog. The phylogenetic analysis includes representative sequences from Cytophaga-Flavobacteria (light blue), Fungi (black and green) (as in Fig. 2), other eukaryotes (in magenta), and more remote bacterial sequences defining and outgroup (dark blue). This tree was computed on Phylogeny.fr web server [30], using the default option of the “advanced mode” without Gblocks. Branch support estimates are indicated in red, and branches have been collapsed for values "
