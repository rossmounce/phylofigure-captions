Phylogenetic tree of nine C. perfringens conjugative plasmids.The phylogenetic tree was inferred using the Neighbor-joining algorithm [35]. The tree is drawn to scale, with branch lengths in the same units as those of the evolutionary distances used to infer the phylogenetic tree. All positions containing gaps were eliminated from the dataset (Pairwise deletion option). Phylogenetic analyses were conducted in MEGA5."
