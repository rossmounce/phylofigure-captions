"pone.0039333.g005.png","Dual hierarchal dendrogram based upon the predominant bacterial families.The clustering for bacterial families and for individual samples from the control dogs and dogs with IBD are based upon Furthest Neighbor metric with Euclidean distances. The arrows next to specific families denote significant differences in relative proportions observed between control and IBD dogs (based upon Mann-Whitney Test, see Table 2). The heatmap represents the relative percentage of each family within each sample with legend presented at the top left of the figure. Of note is that the dendrogram linkages of the bacterial families are not phylogenetic, but clustered based on relative family abundance among animals. Thus, those samples with more similarity (less distance) are more closely related in overall bacterial diversity. Similarly, those bacterial families which have similar percentages across all samples are more closely clustered."
