Alignment of human NCCRP1 with its closest five paralogs and their phylogenetic tree. (A) Shading and consensus lettering were used as described in Fig. 1. Dotted line over the sequence: F-box domain, cyclin-like, as defined in human FBXO2 by InterPro. Solid line over the sequence: F-box domain as defined by compact alpha-helical folding in PDB entry 2E31 [17]. Line under the sequence: the sugar-binding domain as defined previously [17]. (B) Phylogenetic tree with bootstrap support percentages for each node."
