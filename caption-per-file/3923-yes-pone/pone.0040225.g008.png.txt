"pone.0040225.g008.png","Phylogenetic analysis based on the combined protein sequences of the major capsid protein (MCP) and DNA polymerase (DNA Pol) genes.A, a NJ tree, numbers adjacent to branches are supporting values; B, a strict consensus maximum-likelihood tree, numbers adjacent to branches are supporting values. Chilo iridescent virus is used as an out-group in the phylogenetic analysis."
