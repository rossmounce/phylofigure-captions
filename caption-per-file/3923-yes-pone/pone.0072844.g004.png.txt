Sequencing and alignment of the PRDX5 5?-region in Canidae, Ursidae and Phocidae.(A) Phylogenetic relationships between the nine families composing the suborder Caniformia. The phylogeny of Caniformia is currently not completely established, e.g. concerning the position of Ailuridae. The presented phylogenetic tree is based on multiple nuclear gene sequences and is adapted from [44]. (B) Phylogeny of Canidae, based on ?15 kb from 12 exons and 4 introns, resolved by [23]. Canidae family contains three major phylogenetic groups, which are indicated in pink for the fox-like canids, green for the South American canids and blue for the wolf-like canids. Additionally, several canids do not belong to any of the three main clades, such as the gray fox (yellow), which was shown to be more primitive. Adapted from [23]. (C) Schematic diagram of HSPC152/TRMT112 and PRDX5 genes and cloning strategy. Exons I from both genes are detailed. 5? UTRs are indicated by open boxes. Gray box highlights the sequence encoding the potential PRDX5 MTS. Conserved translation start sites are indicated in black. The potential translation start site enabling the translation of L-PRDX5 is indicated in red. P1 and P2 indicate the positions to which the PCR primers (green arrows) map. The primers were designated to map on regions sharing 100% identity between giant panda and domestic dog sequences. (D) ClustalX 2.0.7. nucleotidic sequence alignment of PRDX5 5? region from nine Caniformia. Asterisks (*) indicate identities. Sequences encoding a potential MTS are highlighted in gray. Translation start sites enabling the translation of L-PRDX5 and S-PRDX5 are highlighted in red and black respectively. STOP codons being in-frame with the ATG+1 codon are underlined. Gaps are boxed. Species names are written in brown for Phocidae, gray for Ursidae, yellow for gray fox, red for the fox-like canids, green for the South American canids and blue for the wolf-like canids. Only one of the two alleles (Allele 1) found for gray fox and American black bear PRDX5 are represented. GenBank accession numbers are the following:. Arctic wolf (Canis lupus arctos): JQ411232; American black bear (Ursus americanus) JQ411225; gray fox (Urocyon cinereoargenteus): JQ411227; maned wolf (Chrysocyon brachyurus): JQ411231; northern elephant seal (Mirounga angustirostris): JQ411224; raccoon dog (Nyctereutes procyonoides) JQ411229; red fox (Vulpes vulpes): JQ411230. The sequences of domestic dog and giant panda PRDX5 5? region were downloaded from the Genbank references GeneID:476032 (domestic dog, Canis lupus familiaris) and GeneID:100473172 (giant panda, Ailuropoda melanoleuca)."
