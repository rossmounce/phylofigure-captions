Maximum likelihood phylogenetic analysis of full-length VP1 capsid nucleotide sequences from all GII.4 variant clusters (n?=?162 sequences).Variant clusters described by Zheng et al. are indicated in italics along with their associated years of specimen collection. A new cluster was defined (?08?10?), which contains strains obtained from the United States, Australia, Europe, Asia, and Africa. Percent nucleotide and amino acid distances are provided in an inlaid table. These distances were determined from a multiple sequence alignment containing all known GII.4 nucleotide sequences available in GenBank as of April 2012 (n?=?663 sequences). An average intragroup distance was calculated for all GII.4 sequences, excluding the unique genogroup GII variants KL45 and T091."
