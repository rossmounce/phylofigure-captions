"pone.0024988.g002.png","Phylogenetic relationships of S. suis strains. A Bayesian phylogenetic tree was obtained for the concatenated sequence alignment of 122 single-copy core genes from each genome of the currently available S. suis strains. S. pneumoniae TIGR4 and R6 were included as out-groups. The numbers at the branches are posterior probabilities indicating the support for the branch. The bar indicates the number of substitutions per site (1 per 100 sites)."
