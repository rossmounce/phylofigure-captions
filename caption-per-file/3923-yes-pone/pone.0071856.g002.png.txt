The molecular chaperone Hsp103 is specific to higher primates.The supraorder Euarchontoglires comprises the orders Primates, Dermoptera, Scandentia, Lagomorpha and Rodentia. This illustration shows the relationship of the species which we analyzed for Hsp103 E domain sequences. The figure is a simplified re-drawing from the comprehensive phylogenetic trees generated by Janecka et al. [22] and Perelman et al. [23], limited to the 12 species shown. The presence or absence the extra E domain sequence in the respective species is indicated by or â€“. It turned out that the extra domain of Hsp103 is only present in the genome of Catarrhini, a primate suborder that contains the old world monkeys, great apes and man. Genomic data for the order Dermoptera were not available (n.d.). E domain specific sequences were detected by BLAST searches as described in Materials and Methods for Nomascus leucogenys under NCBI XP_003276214; for Pan troglodytes under NCBI NW_003457860.1 (regions from base 6775968 to 6776180 and from 6814113 to 6814267, matching exon2 and exon1); for Pongo abelii under NCBI NW_002887407.1 (regions from base 9860 to 10072 and from 50476 to 50631) and for Macaca mulatta under NCBI NW_001121227.1 (regions from base 1585406 to 1585618 and from 1619418 to 1619580)."
