Phylogenetic relationship of accessions that recognize ATR1 effector relative to overall Arabidopsis phylogeny. The phylogenetic tree on the left represents the genome-wide relationship between accessions based on small nucleotide polymorphism data as in Figure 1[13]. Arabidopsis accessions capable of recognizing subsets of ATR1 and ATR13 alleles are marked by arrows with the corresponding recognition specificities."
