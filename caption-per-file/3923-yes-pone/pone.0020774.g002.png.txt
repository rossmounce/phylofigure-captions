"pone.0020774.g002.png","Rpb1 proteins resolve monophyletic Trichomonadea, Tritrichomonadea and Hypotrichomonadea, and species and isolates within these groups. All data are from this study, except T. vaginalis isolates G3 and NIH:C1. (A) The phylogenetic tree topology calculated by PhyML 3.0 from 1014 unambiguously aligned amino acids spanning conserved regions A to G of Rpb1 is shown (see Figure S1). Thickened lines indicate the nodes supported by a Bayesian posterior probability of 1.00. Numbers at the nodes correspond to Bayesian posterior probabilities, followed by percent bootstrap support ≥50% given by PhyML and RAxML (1000 replicates each), with LnL = −14857.5, α = 1.38, pI = 0.21. Scale bar represents 0.1 amino acid substitution per site. *Asterisks indicate relationships also supported by insertions. “S” indicates α-amanitin sensitivity, while “R” indicates resistance to α-amanitin [61]. (B) Conserved insertions in Rpb1 region A, with one unique insertion uniting Trichomonadea and another unique insertion only found in Tritrichomonadea. 100% identical aligned amino acids are shown in bold, gaps in the alignment indicated by dashes and #. (C) Conserved region E of Rpb1, which exhibits sensitivity to α-amanitin [67], [68]. Arrows indicate glycine and valine residues (A780G and C781V substitutions) that probably confer α-amanitin resistance to members of the Trichomonas genus. The complete Rpb1 alignment is provided in the Dataset S1. GenBank accession numbers are shown at the left for each taxon."
