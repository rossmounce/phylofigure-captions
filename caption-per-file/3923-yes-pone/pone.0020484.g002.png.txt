"pone.0020484.g002.png","Cyanobacteria and chloroplasts' tmRNA stem W1 length mapped on rRNA phylogenetic tree. A) rRNA phylogenetic tree for cyanobacteria and chloroplasts' for the sequences of tmRNA under study with tmRNA stem W1 length values mapped on the rRNA tree; MrBayes calculated posterior probabilities of partition shown on each node of the tree and every branch is colored according to its stem length. The side bar shows the color legend for stem length values mapped onto the tree by mesquite using the parsimony ancestral reconstruction method. B) The tmRNA sequences including the reconstructed ancestral sequence (at the top generated by Dnapars) for the species present on the rRNA tree in the figure 2A are shown here. The ‘-’ and ‘∼’ indicate sequence absence and non-sequenced regions, respectively."
