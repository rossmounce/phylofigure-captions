"pone.0083111.g001.png","Sequence and phylogenetic analysis of PutAMT1;1.(A) Amino acid sequence of PutAMT1;1 and phylogenetic trees analysis of AMT families; Sequences were obtained from the GeneBank database. The accession numbers are listed in the Material and Methods section. (B) An alignment of the amino acid sequence of PutAMT1;1 (GenBank NO. JQ279059) with TaAMT1;1 (GenBank NO. AY525637), OsAMT1;1 (GenBank NO. AF289477), and AtAMT1;1 (GenBank NO. NM-117425); the colored box indicates conserved amino acid residues. (C) The transmembrane domains in PutAMT1;1 were predicted by the TMHMM algorithm (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TMHMM), and are underlined in black in (B)."
