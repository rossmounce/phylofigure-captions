"pone.0035269.g002.png","Phylogenetic analysis of histone sequences.H2A- and H3-like sequences from Symbiodinium sp. CassKB8, Mf1.05b, and other organisms were used to calculate phylogenetic trees. The trees were inferred using contigs and singlets with full-length amino acid sequences of (A) H2A and (B) H3-like genes using Maximum-Likelihood and Bayesian analysis. Bootstrap values and posterior probabilities are provided as ML/MB for nodes with support above 50% or 0.5. The singlet and contig names are provided for Symbiodinium sp. CassKB8 and Mf1.05b sequences (in bold), other taxa are shown as species name followed by GenBank accession number. The H2 tree was rooted for H2A.Bbd sequences whereas the H3 tree was rooted for Homo sapiens H3."
