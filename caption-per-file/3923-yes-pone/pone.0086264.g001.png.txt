"pone.0086264.g001.png","Neighbour-joining tree inferring phylogenetic relationships of 84 V. cholerae genomes based on 995 orthologous protein-coding genes (954,646 bp).V. cholerae FL Group is labelled in red and V. cholerae V51 is labelled in blue. Haiti non-O1/non-O139 clinical groups-1 and -2 are further defined by Hasan et al. [6]. Numbers at nodes represent bootstrap values. Nucleotide substitution model is the Kimura-2-parameter. Bar length = 0.002 nucleotide substitutions per site."
