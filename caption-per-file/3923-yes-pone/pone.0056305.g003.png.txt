"pone.0056305.g003.png","Bayesian phylogeny of streptococcal Gtfs.Values represent mean node ages obtained from either the nucleotide (top) or the amino acid (bottom) sequences, with the node calibration from [31]. The substitution models were TN93+?+I and WAG+?+I for nucleotide and amino acid data, respectively. The scale at the bottom represents time before present in millions of years. Bacterial species are indicated as follows: cr?=?S. criceti; dt?=?S. dentirousetti; do?=?S. downei; ma?=?S. macacae; mu?=?S. mutans; os?=?S. orisuis; tr?=?S. troglodytae. Strains isolated from Hu?=?human; Ch?=?chimpanzee; Ma?=?macaque; Ha?=?hamster; Pi?=?pig; Ba?=?bat."
