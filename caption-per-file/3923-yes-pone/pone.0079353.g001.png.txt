Phylogenetic tree of family Veillonellaceae based on 16S rRNA gene.The phylogenetic tree was constructed in MEGA4 using neighbor-joining method. The bootstrap values (expressed as percentages of 1000 replications) are shown at branch points. The scale bar represents genetic distance (1 substitution per 100 nucleotides). Isolates in present study are in bold."
