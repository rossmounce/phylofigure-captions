The phylogeny of the major groups of X. fastidiosa showing the patterns that can detect recombination of X. fastidiosa subsp. multiplex DNA into X. fastidiosa subsp. fastidiosa. The top figure shows the relationships of the four subspecific clades (from Schuenzel et al. 2005) labeled with the sequenced genomes: M23 and Temecula-1 (X. fastidiosa subsp. fastidiosa), Ann1 (X. fastidiosa subsp. sandyi), and M12 (X. fastidiosa subsp. multiplex) from the US, and 9a5c (X. fastidiosa subsp. pauca) from Brazil. To track recombination, a unique SNP is shown (O) in the X. fastidiosa subsp. multiplex branch. The lower trees show how recombinational transfer of X. fastidiosa subsp. multiplex DNA to one of the X. fastidiosa subsp. fastidiosa forms leaves a characteristic pattern with the non-recombining X. fastidiosa subsp. fastidiosa remaining identical to X. fastidiosa subsp. sandyi. Note that the same patterns would be created if recombination involved the transfer of a unique SNP from X. fastidiosa subsp. sandyi. Branch lengths are not scaled to divergence."
