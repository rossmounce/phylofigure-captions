Revised topology of the deepest portion of the human MSY tree.The names of the mutations genotyped are indicated on the branches (green, mutations from the paper by Karafet et al. [14]; black, mutations from the paper by Cruciani et al. [16]; red, previously undescribed mutations, see text). For the sake of clarity, the internal structure of haplogroups B-M108.1 (2 branches) and B-50f2(P) (8 branches) is not shown (black triangles). The phylogenetic position of mutations mapping within haplogroup CT is shown in Figure S1. Dashed lines indicate putative branchings (no positive control available). The microsatellite intermediate allele DYS449.2, that was found to delineate new phylogenetic structure in human Y chromosome haplogroup tree [42], was not observed in 19 Y*(xBT) and 4 B chromosomes analyzed."
