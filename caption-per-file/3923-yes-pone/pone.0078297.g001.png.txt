Chalcidoid phylogeny adapted from Munro et al [18]. First phylogeny used in the analysis based on Munro et al [18] of the 126 chalcidoid species used in the analysis indicating species parasitizing Sternorrhyncha (green), Hemiptera other than Sternorrhyncha (red), and both (black). Putative reconstruction of evolutionary transitions in based on maximum parsimony analysis in Mesquite [78]."
