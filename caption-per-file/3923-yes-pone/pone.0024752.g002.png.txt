"pone.0024752.g002.png","Analyses of Class I KNOX genes. (A) Alignment of FaKNOX1 amino acid sequence along with five representatives of Class I KNOX transcription factors. Black boxes indicate identical residues and the grey boxes indicate similar residues. The lines above the sequence mark the KNOX1, KNOX2, GSE and ELK domains and the homeodomain. As characteristic of TALE superclass transcription factors the homeodomain is represented by a three-amino-acid loop extension present between the first and second α-helices of the homeodomain. The letter ‘L’ and ‘T’ represent loop and turn, respectively. (B) The phylogenetic analysis of KNOX genes. Class II KNOX proteins were used as outgroup. Bootstrap values based on 1000 replicates are shown next to the branching points."
