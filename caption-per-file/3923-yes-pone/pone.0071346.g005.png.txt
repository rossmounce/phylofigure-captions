28S rDNA-based phylogeny of P. geminatum ( = C. geminatum) with other dinoflagellates.Sequences obtained in this study are bold-typed. Support of nodes is based on bootstrap values of ML/NJ with 1000 and 500 resamplings, respectively. Only values greater than 60 are shown. If only one of the two phylogenetic methods yielded significant support, the other is shown with “–”. Oxyrrhis marina was used as the outgroup to root the tree. Note that P. geminatum is embedded within the Gymnodinium s. s. clade with strong support, grouped with Polykrikos hartmannii."
