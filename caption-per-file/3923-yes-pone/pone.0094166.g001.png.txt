"pone.0094166.g001.png","Phylogeny of GH5 subfamily 8 including SACTE_2347.The phylogenic tree was constructed from all sequences assigned to the GH5 subfamily 8. Names shown are GenBank accession codes. Black circles indicate enzymes that have been experimentally verified to exhibit Î²-mannanase activity; black stars indicate three enzymes whose structures have been determined besides SACTE_2347. These are: Thermomonospora fusca, AAZ54938.1, PDB 1BQC, 2MAN, 3MAN; Bacillus sp. N16-5, AAT06599.1, PDB 2WHJ, 2WJL, 3JUG; Bacillus sp. JAMB-602, BAD99527.1, PDB 1WKY."
