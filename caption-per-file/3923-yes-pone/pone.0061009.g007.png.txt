Analysis of structural diversity in small regions of the env genes.Characteristic indels in different versions of the env gene are indicated by shaded boxes and labeled with lowercase letters, shown relative to the FeLV-A 61E sequence. (A) Three insertions identified in the Genotype I group: ?a? ? insertion of AGT or AAT; ?b? ? insertion of AATACAAGCAGT; ?c? ? insertion of CCCCAC. (B) Three additional indels identified in the Genotype I group: ?d? ? insertion of ACTACT; ?e? ? insertion of CAGGGC; ?f? ? deletion of three nucleotides at position 535?537 of the FeLV 61E sequence. Boxes with darker shading at ?d? indicate atypical deletions. (C) A single insertion identified in the Genotype II group: ?g? ? insertion of CTT. (D) ? (F) show these indels (?a? to ?g?) plotted on various representations of the best phylogenetic tree shown in Fig. 3."
