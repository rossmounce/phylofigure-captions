"pone.0033212.g002.png","Comparative genomic analysis. (A) Pairwise nucleotide comparison of selected HAdV-D genomes to HAdV-D59 using zPicture. The arrows above the x-axis demarcate the positions of penton base, hexon, E3 region, and fiber coding sequences in the genome of HAdV-D59. The y-axis notes the percent identity. HAdV-D9, HAdV-D22, HAdV-D19C, HAdV-D25, HAdV-D28, HAdV-D36, and HAdV-D56 were used for comparison to HAdV-D59 because they share high nucleotide identity to the aforementioned virus in different sections of their genomes. (B) Whole genome phylogenetic analysis. The phylogenetic tree was constructed from aligned sequences using MEGA, via the neighbor-joining methods and a bootstrap test of phylogeny. Bootstrap values shown at the branching points indicate the percentages of 1000 replications produced the clade. A Bootstrap value of 70 and above is considered to be robust."
