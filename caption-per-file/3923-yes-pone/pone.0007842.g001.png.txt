Mitochondrial DNA phylogenetic tree.Tree of mtDNA haplotypes based on median joining network with African American cases (yellow), African American controls (orange), Senegalese (white), European American cases (light green), and European American controls (dark green). Node sizes are proportional to the sample sizes, indicated by numbers within the node, with the exception of haplogroups H and K labeled by numbers in red. Variable positions typed for these samples in coding, HVS I, and HVS II region are distinguished by red, black and grey font, respectively. The main continental location is indicated by the background color with ochre indicating predominantly African, green West Eurasian, grey Asian, and pink Amerindian haplogroups. The raw data can be found in File S1."
