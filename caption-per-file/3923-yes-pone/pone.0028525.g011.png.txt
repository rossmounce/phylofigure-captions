The salivary 40â€“279 novel family of metastriate ticks. (A) Clustal alignment. The symbols at the bottom indicate (*) identity of residues, (:) conserved and (.) less conserved residues. Identical residues are represented with red letters and yellow background. Conserved residues are shown in blue background. Glycines are shown in yellow background. The red boxes mark the glycine rich regions of 3 Rhipicephalus sequences. (B) Bootstraped phylogram of the alignment in A. The numbers at the nodes indicate the bootstrap support and the bar at the bottom indicates 10% amino acid divergence. The Amblyomma maculatum protein names start with Am- and are recognized by a red circle marker. Remaining sequences are from Rhipicephalus microplus, R. appendiculatus and A. variegatum. Clades with strong bootstrap support are indicated with Roman numerals."
