"pone.0025716.g001.png","Pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) dependent dendogram of isolated Staphylococcus aureus. Pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) proves no specific clonal relationship between PVL-producing isolates issued from furuncles or secondary dermatosis. The similarity of the different pulsotypes was established by using Molecular Analyst™ software. Twenty four pulsotypes corresponded to the 55 isolates and their distribution is given according to the groups of isolates issued from secondary infected dermatosis (1), furuncles from HIV (−)(2) or HIV (+)(3) patients."
