Identification of a novel signal sequence in pathogenic mycobacterial PpiA.Fig. 4A: A phylogram of mycobacterial PpiA type cyclophilins revealed the coalescing of pathogenic mycobacteria (red) into a clade, different than that of non-pathogenic mycobacteria (black). Fig. 4B: Sequence alignment of the N-terminal stretch revealed that the proposed signal sequence present in pathogenic mycobacterial PpiA was either missing or mismatched in non-pathogenic species. Fig. 4C: Sequence logo analysis of the N-terminal stretch of the mycobacterial PpiA type cyclophilins."
