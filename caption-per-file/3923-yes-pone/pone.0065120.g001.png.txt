"pone.0065120.g001.png","Predicted domains in the TaWRKY1 - TaWRKY10 protein sequences and phylogenetic tree.(A) Predicted domains in the WRKY protein. The conserved domains were carried out by MEME using the protein sequences of TaWRKYs and other known WRKYs. This online software was used to create the logo representations of the WRKY domain and the zinc finger motif. On the y axis (measured in bits), depicts the overall height of the stack indicating the sequence conservation at that position, while the height of symbols within the stack indicates the relative frequency of each amino or nucleic acid at that position. (B) Phylogenetic tree of the TaWRKYs domains from various plants. The multiple alignments were generated by CLUSTAL W and the phylogenetic tree was constructed with MEGA4.0 using a bootstrap test of phylogeny with minimum evolution test and default parameters. GenBank accession numbers of WRKY proteins used for drawing phylogenetic tree are shown in Table S5."
