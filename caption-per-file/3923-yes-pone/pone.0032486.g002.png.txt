The phylogenetic tree inferred from bacterial 16S rDNA sequences which were identified in all patients using the Neighbor-Joining and the Kimura 2-parameter methods. Bacteria which were previously identified in pneumonia are shown in black. Bacteria which have not been previously identified in pneumonia and which were identified in this study only in pneumonia patients are shown in red. Bacteria which have not been previously identified in pneumonia patients and which were identified in this study in both pneumonia and control patients are shown in blue, whereas bacteria which have been identified in this study only in control subjects and not in pneumonia patients are shown in green."
