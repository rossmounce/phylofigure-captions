Phylogeny of clade C-associated CooS sequences. Protein phylogeny was determined by Phylip ProML maximum-likelihood analysis of 424 unambiguously aligned and filtered amino acid positions. Support for the tree was calculated by 100 bootstrap-step reanalysis of the dataset using protein maximum-likelihood methods and is reported for nodes with greater than 50% support. Sequences recovered from insect gut inventories are indicated as in figure 3. %G+C content of cooS genes for each translated amino acid sequence is given parenthetically. Group C1, indicated by gray box, contain CooS sequences putatively assigned to the genus Treponema based on phylogenetic inference. Group C2, indicated by gray box, contains CooS sequences of unknown phylogeny that were found only in the omnivorous cockroach, P. americana. Bar indicates distance given as 0.1 changes per amino acid position."
