"pone.0011630.g003.png","Sample gene phylogenies.Each is consistent with gene triplication before the Vitaceae/rosid I separation, followed by the Chamaecrista/Papilionoideae separation, then WGD before the Glycine/Medicago separation; and lastly, WGD in Glycine. At least 18 of the 518 families examined contain similar early triplications with multi-family (Vitis and legume) clades. Inferred duplication timings are shown with red circles. Figure 3A: Vessicle-associated membrane protein family (cl3975, Table S3). The top clade is ambiguous because of four sequence losses (2Gm, 1Mt, 1Cf), so did not contribute to counts toward any of the four hypotheses. The second is consistent with H2a, but is weak evidence: it has three sequence losses (2Mt, Cf), and has bootstrap value of 43% on placement of Cf. The third clade has two sequence losses (Mt, Cf), and is consistent with H1a. Figure 3B: lactoylglutathione lyase protein family. The first clade is “complete” and supports H1a. The second clade is missing four sequences, so contributed to none of the hypotheses. The third clade, with two sequence losses (Mt, Cf), is consistent with H2a (though is weak evidence, considering the bootstrap value of 26% on placement of Cf). Figure 3C: RmlC-type cupin family (cl5891, Table S3). Neither of the legume clades were counted by the automated methods, but on visual examination, they are weakly consistent with H1a and H2a, respectively. The first clade likely has misordered sequences Glyma16g04150, Glyma17g24120 (which derive from the recent WGD and should group together), and MtAC148965_5. This pattern is closest to H1a if the Mt sequence, with bootstrap support of 51%, groups with one of the Gm clades. The Cf sequence, with high bootstrap value, is in an outgroup position with respect to the papilionoid sequences. The second clade, with two sequence losses (both Mt), is consistent with H2a (though is weak evidence, considering the bootstrap value of 47% on placement of Cf)."
