Phylogenetic relationships of the tcpA gene among toxin plasmids and antibiotics resistant gene encoding plasmids of C. perfringens. The phylogenetic tree was constructed by Clustal W analysis based on the nucleotide sequence of tcpA genes (accession numbers; pCPF4969, NC007772; pCPF5603, NC007773; pCP8533etx, AB444205; pCW3, DQ366035; pJGS1987, NZ_ABDW01000012; pATCC3626, ABDV01000020; pJGS1721, NZ_ABOO01000017; pJGS1945, NZ_ABDU01000064; pJIR2774, DQ338473; and pJIR26, DQ338471)."
