Group membership based on chemical and genetic data.(a) Multivariate dendrogram (similarity metric ?=? correlation coefficient) for 54 individuals of Doris ?kerguelenensis? based on extracted total chromatogram mass (TCM) spectra for m/z values with a retention time of 2.5?17 min. The correlation is not size dependent, but rather takes the baseline corrected average mass spectrum of a sample so that comparisons of shapes are more important. Groups with similar chemistry are designated and coloured based on an arbitrarily designated cut-off threshold of 0.3 similarity. Letters below the dendrogram refer to individual slugs. Numbers in coloured blocks below dendrogram give the corresponding phylogroups derived from molecular data. (b) Maximum-likelihood (ML) topology for 193 individuals of D. ?kerguelenensis? based on combined mitochondrial COI, 16S and nuclear ANT data. *indicates bootstrap support of 95 or above and posterior probability of 0.98 or above. Support values less than 60 or 0.90 are not shown. Terminals are coloured to show the distribution and designation of individuals with corresponding chemical data. Scale bar, 0.07 expected changes per site, ML."
