"pone.0065226.g003.png","Metagenomic content and phylogenetic clustering of 66 CF sputa samples.Taxonomic names (family, genus, species, or a combination of species where appropriate) appearing with a relative abundance of at least 15% of denoised reads in one or more specimens are indicated in the legend. Any taxonomic name that failed to meet this threshold was assigned the label “Other”. Organisms considered to be components of normal oropharyngeal microbiota by culture were not further speciated according to standard procedures in the clinical laboratory, and were assigned the general label “Contaminating orophoryngeal flora”. Taxonomic labels apply to parts B and C. (A) Phylogenetic “squash” clustering of CF bacterial composition. Samples are color-coded according to group (indicated in Roman numerals). Samples colored grey are ungrouped. (B) Classification performed by analysis of de-noised deep sequencing reads using pplacer (top panel) and culture (bottom panel). The relative number of each species (by read count or colony abundance, respectively) is represented by the height of corresponding bars. Phylogenetic “squash” clustering of specimens from deep sequence data is represented as a cladogram, with specimens colored as in part A. (C) Consensus microbiota profile of phylogenetic groups, averaged from all members of the group. Relative abundance of species, as estimated by the fraction of contributory reads, is indicated."
