Bayesian phylogenetic tree comparing a 162 nucleotide alignment of known C2H2 zinc finger isoforms (Z1â€“Z6) from X. vesparum (in bold, and indicated by arrows) and five other insects with characterized broad zinc fingers.Numbers presented to the left of nodes represent posterior probability values. See SI Table 1 for corresponding accession numbers."
