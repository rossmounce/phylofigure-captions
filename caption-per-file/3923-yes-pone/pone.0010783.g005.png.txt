Phylogenetic analysis of nucleotide sequences from G. destructans.(A) Phylogenetic tree was constructed by parsimony analysis of ITS sequences. The evolutionary history of representative isolates of G. destructans from this study and the sequences in the databases were inferred using the Maximum Parsimony method and bootstrap consensus tree from 1000 replicates conducted in MEGA 4.1 [54]. After elimination of gaps and missing data, the dataset contained 448 positions of which 109 were parsimony informative. Percentage of replicate trees shown indicate clustering of associated tax in 1000 bootstrap replicates. Asterisks denote sequences deposited by other investigators from bats with WNS in US [14] and France [18]. (B) Phylogenetic tree constructed by parsimony analysis of 28S ribosomal sequences. The evolutionary history of representative isolates of G. destructans from this study and additional related fungi sequenced in our laboratory, were inferred using the Maximum Parsimony method and bootstrap consensus tree from 1000 replicates conducted in MEGA 4.1. After elimination of gaps and missing data, the dataset contained 537 positions of which 88 were parsimony informative. The consensus phylogenetic tree shown was inferred from 94 most parsimonious trees."
