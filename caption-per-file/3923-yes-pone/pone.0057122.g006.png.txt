Structure of the NblA locus and sequence analysis.(A) A phylogenetic tree of NblA proteins. Nodes with bootstrap probabilities > = 90% (1000 replicates) are shown. Red algae are indicated in red and cyanobacteria are indicated in black. The accession numbers of sequences compared are summarized in Table S4; (B) A partial alignment of NblA proteins. More highly conserved residues are shown in deeper blue. The numbers in the corners indicate alignment start/end positions of amino acid residues in the P. yezoensis nuclear/plastid NblA homologs, respectively; (C) Predicted genomic structure and PCR amplification of NblA locus. The position of forward (F) and reverse (R) primers used is indicated by arrows on the predicted genomic structure. PCR amplification of the gene was performed using genomic DNA (gDNA) from protoplasts and complementary DNA (cDNA) from thalli of P. yezoensis as templates. The dotted line in the genomic structure represents undetermined nucleotide sequence."
