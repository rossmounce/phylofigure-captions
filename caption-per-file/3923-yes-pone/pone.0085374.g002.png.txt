First step of source tracing: defining the phylogenetic position of outbreak strains.(A) MLTree of 2009 outbreak strains and 24 representative Y. pestis strains with global diversity. The branch length reveals genetic distance between isolates, except for the branch of 0.PE3, which was truncated for visual effect. The root was defined by the ancestor Y. pseudotuberculosis, IP32953. Each strain is labeled with different symbols and colors that correspond to its geographical distribution on the map in panel B. Strains that are not mapped in panel B are labeled with an asterisk. As no variations exist across outbreak strains, the corresponding branches were collapsed in the tree. All nodes have a bootstrap support of more than 90%. (B) Geographic information of the strains in the MLTree."
