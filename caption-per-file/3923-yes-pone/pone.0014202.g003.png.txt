Homology with Dipteran transcriptomes decreases with increasing phylogentic difference.The number of An. funestus contigs with significant BLAST hits in pairwise comparisons to An. gambiae, Ae. aegypti, C. quinquefasciatus and D. melanogaster is plotted. Note that the y-axis only spans 9,000 to 15,000. The solid line indicates the total number of contigs with a significant BLAST hit in each comparison. The dashed line indicates the number of contigs with a significant BLAST hit in all comparisons as phylogenetic distance increases. The phylogenetic tree at the bottom of the panel depicts the evolutionary relationships between the Dipteran insects used in pairwise BLAST comparisons, with estimated divergence times (in millions of years) at each node (adapted from [53])."
