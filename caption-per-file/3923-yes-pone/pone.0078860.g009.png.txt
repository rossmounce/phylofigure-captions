Phylogenetic tree of ABCI (NAP) protein sequences from Arabidopsis and Vitis vinifera.The amino acid sequences of all Arabidopsis ABCI (NAP) proteins and those of Vitis vinifera were aligned using the MUSCLE program and subjected to phylogenetic analysis by the distance with neighborjoining method using MEGA5 programme. Accession numbers for Arabidopsis sequences are AtABCI8 (NP_192386.1), AtABCI21 (NP_199224.1), AtABCI17 (NP_176961.1), AtABCI19 (NP_563694.1), AtABCI7 (NP_564404.1), AtABCI6 (NP_187678.1), AtABCI20 (NP_195847.1), AtABCI1 (NP_176516.1), AtABCI13 (NP_564850.1), AtABCI10 (NP_195072.2) and AtABCI11 (NP_196914.1). AtSKD1 (AEC08019.1) and VvSKD1 (XP_002266534.1) were used as outgroups."
