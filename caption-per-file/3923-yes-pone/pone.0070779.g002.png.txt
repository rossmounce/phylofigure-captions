"pone.0070779.g002.png","Unrooted neighbour-joining tree for orbivirus subcore-shell T2 proteins.A phylogenetic tree was constructed using distance matrices, generated using the p-distance determination algorithm and pairwise deletion parameters in MEGA 5 (1000 bootstrap replicates) [65]. Since many of the available sequences are incomplete, the analysis is based on partial sequences (aa 393 to 548, numbered with reference to the aa sequence of BTV-VP3(T2)). The numbers at nodes indicate bootstrap confidence values after 1000 replications. The tree shown in Figures 3 and 4 were drawn using the same parameters. The CORV and CMPV isolates are shown in red font in the amber coloured circle. Full names of virus isolates and accession numbers of T2 protein sequences used for comparative analysis are listed in Table S1 (supplementary data). ?e? and ?w? after serotype number indicate eastern and western topotype strains, respectively."
