The panorama phylogenetic tree of type A influenza virus based on the viral NA representative sequences.The tree demonstrated that all the 9 NA subtypes were genetically distant to each other, and subtypes N1 and N2 were more dominant than others. The panorama diversity of each of the NA subtypes was detailed in Figure 10âˆ¼Figure 14. Bootstrap values were given at relevant nodes."
