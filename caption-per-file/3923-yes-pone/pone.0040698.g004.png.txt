"pone.0040698.g004.png","Neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree of bacterial ANP-like domains contained in animal heme peroxidases with G-x-D-G-x(5)-D-D.The domain of human myeloperoxidase, which does not contain any hit, is included as an out-group member. The alignment shown in figure S2 was cut at the position which corresponds to the sequence boundaries of the human myeloperoxidase domain. The tree is based on this reduced alignment. The bootstrap consensus tree inferred from 500 replicates is shown. Letters â€“A and -B refer to N- and C-terminal ANP-like domains, respectively. All the 23 sequences here considered presented at least one insert with the consensus of PERCAL (G-x-D-G-x(2)-G/N-T/N-x-D-D) (Table S1). The column on the right indicates the number of insertions in each of the domains. Bar: 0.2 substitutions per amino acid position."
