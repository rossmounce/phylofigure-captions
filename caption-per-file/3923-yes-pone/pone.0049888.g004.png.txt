Phylogenetic relationship of polysaccharide deacetylase-containing prokaryotic metacaspases.A set of highly conserved metacaspase sequences found in the Gammaproteobacterial genera Xyllela, Stenotrophomonas and Xanthomonas, including Xanthomonas campestris, in which the protein has been implicated in programmed cell death (PCD) [15], [22], as well as in the Acidobacteria Candidatus Solibacter usitatus Ellin6067 and Candidatus Koribacter versatilis Ellin345. The metacaspase involved in Xanthomonas campestris pv. glycines PCD (GI 88792532) [68] is emphasized in red. The metacaspase domains of all 17 sequences identified in genomes analyzed in this study have conserved cysteine-histidine catalytic dyads. The maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree to the left was produced by alignment of the sequences with Muscle v3.8.31 [71] followed by tree construction with FastTree v2.1.3 [74]. Three cysteine-histidine positive sequences from Trichodesmium erythraeum IMS101 (Cyanobacteria), Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato str. DC3000 (Gammaproteobacteria) and Pyrocoocus yayanosii CH1 (Euryarchaeota) were used as an outgroup."
