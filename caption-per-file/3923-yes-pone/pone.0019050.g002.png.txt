Genomic and phylogenetic analysis of the virus genomes discovered by VEM. The tree is midpoint rooted for clarity, all nodes with more than 75% bootstrap support are labeled, and new sequences are indicated by arrows. A) Maximum likelihood phylogeny of the entire DNA-A of the novel Chenopodium leaf curl virus - [USA:Florida:Citra: 2009], Chenopodium leaf curl virus - [USA:Florida:Citra: 2007:VEM] , and Sida golden mosaic Linguanea virus- [USA:Florida:Homestead:2009:VEM] with related begomovirus genome sequences. B) Maximum likelihood phylogeny of the entire DNA-B of the Sida golden mosaic virus - [USA:Florida:Citra:2007:VEM] and Whitefly VEM Begomovirus - [USA:Florida:Homestead:2009:VEM]. Begomovirus names are abbreviated according to convention. C & D) Genome characteristics and organization of the DNA-A, DNA-B and satellite DNA identified in the Citra and Homestead samples. The ORFs encode for: CP/AV1, coat protein; Rep/AC1, replication-associated protein; TrAP/AC2, transcription activator and/or silencing suppressor; REn/AC3, replication enhancer; MP/AV2, movement protein; AC4, AC4 protein; AC5, AC5 protein; MP/BC1, movement protein; NSP/BV1, nuclear shuttle protein. The positions of sequence fragments recovered in the virome, the conserved stem loop and nonanucleotide sequence are indicated."
