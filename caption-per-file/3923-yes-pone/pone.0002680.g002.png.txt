"pone.0002680.g002.png","Bayesian phylogenetic tree of the cnidarian fluorescent proteins; Arthropoda FPs are shown as an outgroup.The edges with posterior probability less than 0.95 are collapsed. Black dots identify the proteins first described in this paper. Major clades and sub-clades are denoted, as well as the two reconstructed ancestral proteins (All-coral and All-Faviina). See legend for the color-coding of FP color classes. The position of meffGFP is tentative based on the short portion of its sequence that did not undergo gene conversion (see text for details). See Table S1 for the GenBank accession numbers corresponding to the protein names, and File S1 for the FASTA-formatted alignment of coding cDNA sequences."
