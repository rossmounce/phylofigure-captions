"pone.0071483.g002.png","Phylogenetic analysis of the partial RdRp (273 bp) sequence of the identified NoV strains in Beijing, China.All the 26 RdRp sequences of NoV strains were obtained by RT-PCR amplification. The NoV strain (PKUPH-127/Outpatient) with a distinct genotype following the analysis of capsid regions that has conflicting RdRp genotypes is marked by a solid triangle. The remaining 25 NoV strains displayed the same genotypes based on capsid and RdRp regions. A Kimura 2-parameter model in the maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree was used for nucleotide substitution, and substitution rates were assumed to be gamma distributed (G). The final tree was optimized using the heuristic nearest-neighbor-interchange (NNI) method. The numbers on each branch indicate the bootstrap values. The reference strains of GI (GI.1?GI.6) and GII (GII.1?GII.12 except GII.5, GII.7 and GII.10) are depicted in italics and GenBank accession numbers are included. The clustering is based on the classification of Zheng et al. [24]."
