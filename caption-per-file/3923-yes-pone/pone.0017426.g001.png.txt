"pone.0017426.g001.png","A phylogenetic tree of the FEZ protein family. The tree was derived by the parsimony method (Phylip protpars). The bootstrap multidataset and resampling method was employed and the numbers on the branches indicate the number of times the partition of the species into the two sets which are separated by that branch occurred among the trees out of 999.96 trees. The arrow indicates the probable point of FEZ gene duplication. Ag – Anopheles gambiae, Am – Apis mellifera, Ap – Acyrthosiphon pisum, Bf – Branchiostoma floridae (Bfa and Bfb refer to two sequences [polymorphisms] of selected hypothetical genes in this species), Bm – Brugia malayi, Bt – Bos taurus, Ce – Caenorhabditis elegans, Cf – Canis familiaris, Ci – Ciona intestinalis, Da – Drosophila ananassae, Dg – Drosophila grimshawi, Dm – Drosophila melanogaster, Dmj – Drosophila mojavensis, Dp – Drosophila persimilis, Dpo – Drosophila pseudoobscura, Dr – Danio rerio, Ds – Drosophila sechellia, Dv – Drosophila virilis, Dw – Drosophila willistoni, Dy – Drosophila yakuba, Ec – Equus caballus, Gg –Gallus gallus, Hs – Homo sapiens, Md – Monodelphis domestica, Mf – Macaca fascicularis, Mm – Mus musculus, Mmt – Macaca mulatta, Nv – Nasonia vitripennis, Ph – Pediculus humanus, Pt – Pan troglodytes, Rn – Rattus norvegicus, Ss – Salmo salar, Tc – Tribolium castaneum, Tg –Taeniopygia guttata, Tn – Tetraodon nigroviridis, Xl – Xenopus laevis, Xt – Xenopus tropicalis."
