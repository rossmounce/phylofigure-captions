Phylogenetic reconstruction of the evolutionary relationships between the members of the pe and ppe protein families. A. Phylogeny of the ppe protein family. The phylogenetic tree was constructed from the phylogenetic analysis done on the 180 aa N-terminal domains of the ppe proteins. The tree was rooted to the outgroup Rv3873 (ppe68), shown to be the first ppe insertion into the ESAT-6 (esx) gene clusters [8]. Figure reproduced from reference 8 with permission of the authors. B.
