"pone.0028550.g002.png","Phylogenetic analysis of WGST data from C. gattii VGII molecular type isolates. Maximum parsimony phylogenetic analysis was performed in MEGA4 on WGST SNP data from 18 VGII C. gattii genomes using the R265 whole genome sequence as the reference for SNP discovery (R265a-H-BC-02). The analysis found 76 most parsimonious trees, one of which is shown. The total number of SNPs included in the analysis is indicated (number of parsimonious SNPs in parentheses) as is the consistency index (CI) as calculated by MEGA4. Bootstrap values less than 50% are not shown. The tree shown is rooted on the mid-point. Branch lengths as calculated by MEGA4 are indicated above the three major branches. All other branch lengths are less than 500. The taxa nomenclature include a unique four digit identifier, the molecular subtype (a, b or c), the source of the isolate (A = alpaca, C = cat, D = dog, E = environmental, H = human and P = porpoise), the location of origin (BC = British Columbia, CA = California, ID = Idaho, OR = Oregon and WA = Washington state), and the year of collection. For example, B7395a-D-WA-08 indicates that isolate B7395 is a VGIIa subtype collected from a dog in Washington state in 2008."
