"pone.0051542.g001.png","Radial phylogenetic trees of A) archaeal and B) bacterial amoA sequences.High level clades are indicated by different colours, which are also used in supplementary information (Supporting Information S7, evaluation with environmental samples) where appropriate. Note: the colours indicating high level clades on this figure do not correspond to the colours used on Supporting Information S1 (probe set specificities). On the AOA tree, clusters from a very recent review on AOA phylogeny are also shown in blue [38]. For the exact position of the Nitrososphaera sister cluster and Nitrosocaldus cluster, please refer to Supporting Information S1. Soil+Est.Sed = Soil+Estuarine Sediment."
