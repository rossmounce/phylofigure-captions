"pone.0092033.g004.png","Phylogenetic analyses of five-level ploidy M. anguillicaudatus and other 28 Cobitoidea species.The species and their NCBI Accession No. were listed in Table S2. The phylogenetic analyses were conducted based on the concatenated 13 mitochondrial protein-coding genes with maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian inference (BI) methods. Numbers on the nodes represent support values inferred from ML (left) bootstrap and BI (right) probability analyses, respectively (only values above 50 of bootstrap value or 0.50 of Bayesian posterior probability are shown). NA indicates the nod by BI is not essentially identical to that of the ML tree."
