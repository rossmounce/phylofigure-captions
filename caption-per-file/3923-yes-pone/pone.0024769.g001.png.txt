Assessing phylogenetic signal through taxonomic congruence. The equations used tocalculate the scores for two measures of phylogenetic signal through taxonomic congruence used in this study. Example calculations are shown for three cladograms each containing two concordance groups (Mt = 2), one red, one blue, with each group having 4 species (Gt = 8). In practice the scores can be calculated by coding membership in a concordance group as a character in a datamatrix and obtaining CI and RI values from PAUP."
