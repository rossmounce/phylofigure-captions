UPGMA phylogenetic tree of the eight Lepus europaeus DQA exon 2 alleles.UPGMA phylogenetic tree resulting from the analysis of the eight Lepus europaeus DQA exon 2 alleles identified in this study, together with sequences assessed in the study of Koutsogiannouli et al. 2009 available from GenBank. Numbers indicate the percentage bootstrap support (10000 replicates). The evolutionary distances were computed using the maximum composite likelihood method and are in the units of the number of base substitutions per site. The populations in which each allele was present are given abbreviated in parentheses. (The neighbour-joining tree produced similar results with comparable bootstrap values)."
