Phylogenetic tree inferred from the regions of the complete 18S and 28S rDNA sequences with conserved lengths.The numbers associated with the nodes are posterior probability values (first number) and bootstrap values (second number) obtained by Bayesian/ML analysis respectively. The lengths of the branches follow the phylogram of the Bayesian tree."
