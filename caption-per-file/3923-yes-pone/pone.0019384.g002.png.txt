Analyses of secretin phylogeny and in silico genomic locations. (A) Ligand Phylogeny: phylogenetic analysis of the secretin/glucagon hormone precursor superfamily. The tree was generated by Maximum Likelihood (ML) and plotted by MEGA 5.0. Sequences determined in the present study are marked by an asterisk. SCT, secretin precursor; preproGHRH, prepro-growth hormone-releasing hormone; PHI-VIP, peptide histidine isoleucine-vasoactive intestinal peptide precursor; PRP-PACAP, pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP)-related peptide-PACAP precursor. (B) Chromosomal locations of secretin genes in various vertebrate species. Neighboring genes of secretin in different vertebrate genomes are shown. Homologous genes in proximity of secretin are linked by straight lines to demonstrate the syntenic gene environment of secretin in the analyzed vertebrate species."
