"FIGURE 2. ML-tree of studied Cyrtodactylus species based on the analysis of 602 bp of COI mtDNA gene. Node colour indicates support value: black for well-supported and sufficiently supported nodes, grey for moderately or poorly supported nodesand white for unresolved nodes with low or no support. Bootstrap support values are shown above or below tree nodes for NJ / ML / MP analyses respectively. Species of the ะก. irregularis species complex are marked with grey."
