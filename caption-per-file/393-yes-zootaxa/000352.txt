FIGURE 2. Phylogenetic relationships between Crocodylus species inferred from the maximum likelihood and Bayesian approaches of D-loop sequence data generated from the 619 individual Philippine crocodiles with representatives of 10 other crocodilian taxa. Numbers above the branches represent posterior probability support. Numbers below the branches represent
