"FIGURE 72. Phylogeny of Kentropyx based on morphology in our study (A, all characters ordered) and that of Werneck et al.(D, 2008, their figure 2A) compared to phylogenies based primarily on allozymes and mtDNA (B, Reeder et al. 2002, their figure 3) or just mtDNA (C, Werneck et al. 2008, their figure 3A). In all trees, numbers indicate bootstrap support."
