FIGURE 12. Phylogram based on an alignment of mitochondrial COI sequences for the genus Eurycercus. The tree is midpoint rooted and based on the best ML tree found in PhyML 3.0 (see text). Support values are from nonparametric bootstrap and from approximate likelihood ratio tests. Values less than 70 or 0.7 are not shown. The scale bar represents substitutions per site based on a GTR+I+G model. Proposed species are numbered. See Table 1 for Genbank Accession numbers.
