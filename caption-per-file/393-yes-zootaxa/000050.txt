"FIGURE 62. Hypothetical phylogeny of Raninoidia, with the various characters numbered as follows: 1. Paired spermathecaedependent of phragma 7 / 8 (symplesiomorphy of Raninoidia with Podotremata); 2. Paired structure (double peg or hook withtwo spines) on episternite 5 involved in abdominal holding (preserved in Lyreididae, lost in all other Raninoidea) (synapomorphy of Raninoidia); 3. Gymnopleurity (synapomorphy of Raninoidea); 4. Modified position of spermathecal apertures (synapomorphy of Raninoidea); 5. Abdomen not held against body (synapomorphy of Raninidae)."
