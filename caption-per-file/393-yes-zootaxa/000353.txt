FIGURE 3. Phylogenetic relationships between Crocodylus species inferred from the maximum likelihood and Bayesian approaches of ND4-Phe sequence data generated from four haplotypes from the 14 Philippine crocodile individuals (two fromeach D-loop haplotype) with 10 out-group taxa. Numbers above the branches represent posterior probability support.
