"FIGURE 6. Phylogram from a MP analysis of sequences from the partial 28S region (D1â€“D3) of all known marine transversotrematid groups from the Indo-West Pacific region. This is tree one of 27 most parsimonious trees (length  =  630). The consistency index is (0.723849), the retention index is (0.796296) and the composite index is 0.629453 (0.576399) for all sites and parsimony-informative sites). The percentage of replicate trees in which the associated taxa are clustered together in the bootstrap test (1000) replicates are shown next to the branches. The Complete Deletion option resulted in a total of 809 positions inthe final dataset, of which 244 were parsimony informative Note that the sequences for T. haasi, C. formosa, P. steeri and B."
