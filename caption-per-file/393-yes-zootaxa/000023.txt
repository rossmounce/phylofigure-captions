FIGURE 28. Phylogenetic tree based on 16 Argasidae ticks and Ixodes holocyclus (outgroup). The alignment was made with631 characters (including gaps) of the 16S rRNA mitochondrial gene used in the analysis. The Bayesian support (posterior probabilities) values are derived from 500 replicates. The branch length scale is the number of substitutions per site. The species with similar morphology are in a grey box.
