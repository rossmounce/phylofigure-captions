"FIGURE 1. Maximum likelihood tree based on the mitochondrial ND2 gene and flanking tRNAs showing relationships among species of New Caledonian diplodactylids and their immediate sister-group, the Australian genus Pseudothecadactylus. Valuessubtending branches are maximum likelihood /  Bayesian posterior probabilities above the line and maximum parsimony"
