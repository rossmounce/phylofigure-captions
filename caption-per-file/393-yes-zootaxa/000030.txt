FIGURE 8. Allozyme analyses. A. Minimum evolution tree showing the relationships of 14 populations based on Nei’s (1978)D (Table 4) for 27 variable loci included in allozyme study 1. The topology of the neighbor-joining tree is identical. B. Multidimensional scaling of Nei’s (1978) D (Table 5) for eight populations from the nigriventris group based on allozyme study 2.Note the intermediate position of the Cannell Creek (CAN) population between B. bramei from Fairview (FAI) and B. simatus
