"FIGURE 9. Cladistic tree based on mtCOI sequences of Pseudodiaptomus koreanus sp. nov. from Korean estuaries and P.inopinus from Korean and Japanes estuaries. Numbers at branch points are bootstrap values (i.e., percentage of tree with that branch point among 1000 subreplicates). The axis scale indicates branch lengths in the same units as those of the evolutionary"
