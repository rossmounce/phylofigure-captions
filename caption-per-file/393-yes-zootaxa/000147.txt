"FIGURE 1. Phylogeny of cytochrome b resulting from maximum-likelihood (ML) analysis (GTR + I + G model). Numbers atnodes represent ML bootstrap support (1000 replications), and Bayesian posterior probabilities. To improve clarity values ofthe most apical nodes (i.e. within species) are not included, and only values for the best supported nodes between outgroup species are included. A black circle indicates BP  =  100 and PP  = 1.00; a grey circle indicates BP >95 and PP > 0.99."
