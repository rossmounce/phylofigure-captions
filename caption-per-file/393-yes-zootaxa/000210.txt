"FIGURE 3. Phylogenetic tree resulting from the Bayesian analysis of the cyt-b gene sequences of Ctenomys. The outgroup isnot shown. Numbers indicate support (Bootstrap [only those above 50 % are shown], Bremer support, and Posterior probabilities) of the nodes at their right (see details in text). For those sequences retrieved from GenBank, accession numbers are provided next to species labels. For those sequences gathered by us, specimen collection numbers are provided next to specieslabel."
