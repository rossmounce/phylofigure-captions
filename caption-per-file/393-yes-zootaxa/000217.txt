"FIGURE 2. Bayesian Inference tree (-ln L 13794.01) based on ND2 and its flanking tRNAs showing the relationships between populations of Cyrtodactylus quadrivirgatus and the placement of C. payacola sp. nov. Bayesian topology with Bayesian posterior probabilities (BPP), Maximum Likelihood (ML), and Maximum Parsimony (MP) bootstrap support values, respectively(BPP / ML / MP), at the nodes. Nodes with low support are indicated with a â€“ (i.e. BPP < 0.90, ML < 70, and MP < 70)."
