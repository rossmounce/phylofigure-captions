"FIGURE 5. Results of 16S mtDNA analysis. a) Consensus tree from Maximum Likelihood analysis. Scale bar refers to substitutions per site. Bootstrap support values above nodes correspond to Maximum Likelihood analysis, those below the nodes tothe Maximum Parsimony consensus tree of exactly the same topology. (b) Parsimony network derived from the same alignment, each node representing a unique haplotype."
