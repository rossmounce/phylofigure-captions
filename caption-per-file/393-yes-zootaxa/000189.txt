"FIGURE 6. Maximum likelihood phylogram of Rossellidae inferred from concatenated 18S, 28S, 16S, and COI sequences using mixed models (see Methods for details). Outgroups (Oopsacas minuta + Leucopsacus sp.) omitted for clarity. The alignment has 4110 bp, 686 distinct alignment patterns, and 7.84% gaps. Bootstrap proportions are given at nodes; the values are based on 100 pseudoreplicates as determined by the autoMRE bootstopping criterion (Pattengale et al. 2010). Scale bar indicates expected number of substitutions per site. Previously unpublished specimens highlighted in boldface."
