"FIGURE 8. Phylogram of a maximum parsimony analysis of sequences of the ITS2 rDNA region showing five distinct genotypes of transversotrematids from mullid fishes from the Indoâ€“West Pacific. The consistency index is (0.888889), the retentionindex is (0.977654) and the composite index is 0.934680 (0.86905) for all sites and the parsimony-informative sites (in parentheses). After all positions containing gaps were eliminated from the dataset there were a total of 360 positions in the final data"
