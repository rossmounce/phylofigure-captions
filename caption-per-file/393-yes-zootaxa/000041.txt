FIGURE 3. Bayesian majority rule consensus tree of the sea snakes sampled in this study based on the concatenated mitochondrial alignment. Hydrophis donaldi sp. nov. forms a highly divergent lineage although its phylogentic position remains poorlyresolved. Nodes with maximum likelihood bootstrap support >70 (below) and Bayesian posterior probability >0.8 (above) are indicated. The outgroup Aipysurus laevis is not shown. Scale bar indicates the number of nucleotide substitutions per site.
