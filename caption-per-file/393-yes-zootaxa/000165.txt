"FIGURE 3. Original ML tree (500 bootstrap pseudoreplicates), showing the location of the sister salamander species from Cordillera de Mérida (Mérida state), B. orestes (Sierra La Culata) and La Mucuy salamander (Bolitoglossa sp. nov., SierraNevada de Mérida). The analysis was performed using default parameters (Kimura 2-parameter model, with uniform substitution rates among sites). The tree is drawn to scale, with branch lengths measured in the number of substitutions per site."
