"FIGURE 4. Phylogenetic relationships among species in the bitaeniatus-group. Bayesian majority-rule consensus tree forcombined 16S and ND4 markers. Bayesian posterior probabilities above branches, MP boostrap values below branches. **indicates nodes with Bayesian Pp  =  1.0 and MP bootstrap support  =  100%. Scale bar indicates the proportion of nucleotide substitutions. Values in parentheses  =  collecting locality numbers (see Figure 1 and Table 1)."
