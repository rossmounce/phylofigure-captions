"FIGURE 5. Phylogenetic relationships among species in the bitaeniatus-group. Bayesian majority-rule consensus tree generated from 422bp of partial 16S. Bayesian posterior probabilities above branches, MP boostrap support values below branches.** indicates supported nodes (Bayesian Pp ≥0.95 and MP ≥70%). Scale bar indicates number of nucleotide substitutions. Missing values indicate conflicting topology between Bayesian and MP trees. Values in parentheses  =  collecting locality numbers(see Figure 1 and Table 1)."
