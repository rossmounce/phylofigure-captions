"FIGURE 2. Phylogenetic relationships between Crangonyx species based on morphology. The tree is based on the characters defined by Zhang and Holsinger (2003), reconstructed by maximum parsimony and rooted with Crymostygius thingvallensis as outgroup. The morphological characters states are displayed as following: white circle  =  0, black circle  = 1, grey circle  =  2,"
