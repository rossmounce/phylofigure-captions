FIGURE 19. Phylogenetic hypothesis of Aysenia species and outgroups. Support values for groups expressed as Bremer support in units of fit x 100 (top) and Jackknifing absolute frequency (bottom) for the tribe Amaurobioidini. Only the basal branch is shown for outgroup genera with more than one species (indicated by “spp.”). Constant of concavity K  =
