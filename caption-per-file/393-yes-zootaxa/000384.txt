"FIGURE 2. Phylogenetic tree depicting relationships of species of Catostomidae (and / or gene tree) inferred using partitioned maximum-likelihood (ML) analysis of 1,933 aligned nucleotides across all IRBP2 gene regions in data matrix 2 (ML score 8206.174368). Branch lengths are proportional to number of substitutions under the GTR+G+I model. Numbers on branches are ML bootstrap values; those below 50% are not shown. Solid points on nodes indicate statistically robust nodes with a posteriori"
