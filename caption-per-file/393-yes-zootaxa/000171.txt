"FIGURE 15. The single most parsimonious tree (Matrix 2) under equal weights (L  =  930, CI  =  0.23, RI  =  0.58). Thicker linesindicate presence of tegular sac. Black square indicates the only clade within the “Distal erigonines” having embolic membranewith thread-like projections and no protegulum; black circles indicate the three clades having distal tibial apophysis."
