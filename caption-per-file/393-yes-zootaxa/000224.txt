"FIGURE 1. Maximum likelihood phylogenies of Aromobates, other dendrobatids, and closely related hyloids. The phylogenies were inferred using mitochondrial (12S rRNA -tRNA Val-16S rRNA) and nuclear (POMC and NACA) genes. Nodal support based on 200 non-parametric bootstrap replicates and Bayesian posterior probabilities. Museum voucher numbers and GenBank accession numbers are provided."
