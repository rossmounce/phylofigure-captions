"FIGURE 11. Character optimizations for the preferred cladogram (Matrix 1) under equal weights (L  =  268, CI  =  0.40, RI  = 0.68). Ambiguous character changes were resolved under Farris optimization in WINCLADA. Black circles represent nonhomoplasious character changes, white circles homoplasious. Black square indicates the Ternatus clade; thicker lines indicatepresence of a tegular sac (Character 10)."
