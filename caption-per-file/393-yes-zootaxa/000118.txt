FIGURE 10. Interrelationships among the Magellanic endemic lycodine genera. Consensus tree resulting from the parsimonyanalysis of 78 morphological characters (Length = 105; CI = 0.53; RI = 0.50). Bootstrap support values (rep = 1000) are indicatedon the nodes. White boxes on branches: homoplastic apomorphies; black boxes: synapomorphies.
