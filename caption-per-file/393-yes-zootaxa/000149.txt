"FIGURE 3. Phylogeny resulting from maximum-likelihood (ML) analysis of the combined cytochrome b + BRCA1 gene sequences. To improve clarity values of the most apical nodes (i.e. within species) are not included, and only values for the best supported nodes between outgroup species are included. A black circle indicates BP  =  100 and PP  = 1.00; a grey circle indicates"
