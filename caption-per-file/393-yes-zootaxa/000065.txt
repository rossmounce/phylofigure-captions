"FIGURE 1. Phylogenetic relationships between Crangonyx species based on morphology. The tree is based on the charactersdefined by Zhang and Holsinger (2003) and reconstructed by maximum parsimony. The tree is rooted with the Synurella outgroup as defined by Zhang and Holsinger (2003). The morphological characters states are displayed as following: white circle =  0, black circle  = 1, grey circle  =  2, crossed circle  =  data not available. The species groups defined by Zhang & Holsinger"
