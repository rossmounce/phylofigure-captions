"FIGURE 5. Reconstructions of character states of the Musculus vocalis ventralis in a reduced subset of the family Thamnophilidae derived from the phylogenetic analyses (see Fig. 2 and 3). A. Unordered parsimony reconstruction, gray color indicates equivocal ancestral states under the most parsimonious reconstructions set. B. Maximum likelihood reconstruction."
