"FIGURE 3. Representation of the hypothesis of relationships among dactyloid anoles by Losos et al. 1998 and Jackman et al.1999. While figures from both studies are virtually identical, our representation is derived largely from Jackman et al. (1999) because the taxon names are not visible in Losos et al. (1998)."
