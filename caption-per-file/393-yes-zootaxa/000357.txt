"FIGURE 6. Phylogeny reconstructed from ITS rDNA sequences of Heterorhabditis species. Only bacteriophora and megidisgroups are shown. Heterorhabditis beicherriana n. sp. has eight characters that change unambiguously on branch and fiveautapomorphies ( =  unique, derived characters, rectangular boxes at the positions 464, 846, 985, 1055 and 1109), all of thembeing transitions. NC  =  number of change."
