"FIGURE 6. Circular maximum parsimony phylogenetic trees of recognised Thai and representative Palaearctic Aleiodes species as in FIGURE 5, colour coded according to character state. A, occipital carina: red  =  dorsally complete, pink  =  dorsally nearlycomplete; B, hind wing vein SR1: red  =  strongly diverging from anterior wing margin (or curved to come closer to margin again)evenly from its base, blue  =  more or less parallel to wing margin for 0.25â€“0.6 of its length and then strongly diverging; C, hind coxa,"
