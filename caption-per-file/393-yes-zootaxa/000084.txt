FIGURE 3. Phylogeny of the genus Blarinella derived from maximum parsimony and neighbor joining analyses of cyt-b and cyt-b + 16S rRNA + ApoB fragments. Neighbor Joining (NJ) and Maximum parsimony (MP) bootstrap values of cyt-b are shown above the branches; MP and NJ bootstrap values of cyt-b + 16S rRNA + ApoB are shown under the branches.
