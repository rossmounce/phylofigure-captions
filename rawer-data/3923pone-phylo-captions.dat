"pone.0062560.g004.png","Maximum likelihood analysis and past population dynamics of HIV-1 CRF33_01B disseminating among various risk groups in Southeast Asia (Malaysia and Indonesia).The maximum likelihood reconstruction and past population dynamics of all available CRF33_01B isolates was estimated by PAUP* v4.0 beta [40] and the Bayesian sampling approach implemented in BEAST v1.7 [47], respectively. A total of 242 CRF33_01B sequences (pol region, HXB2?2253?3260) spanning year 2005?2012 among individuals from various risk groups (inclusive of 152 and 90 sequences with known and unknown transmission risks, respectively) and geographical origins (central, northern and eastern states of Malaysia) and two full-length sequences from Indonesia were analyzed. The data set of CRF33_01Bpol sequences were amplified from HIV-1 positive samples collected from the following regions: the central states of Malaysia (n?=?142) including Kuala Lumpur (n?=?54, including four CRF33_01B reference sequences [21], Selangor (n?=?86) and Negeri Sembilan (n?=?2); the northern states (n?=?85) including Kelantan (n?=?79) and Perak (n?=?6); and the eastern state (n?=?13) of Pahang [22]. Indonesian CRF33_01B reference sequences (n?=?2) were retrieved from the online database [27] and included in the analyses. A, Maximum likelihood analysis of CRF33_01Bpol data set containing 152 sequences with known transmission risks revealed a phylogenetic tree with star-like appearance, in which the terminal tree branches (mean length: 0.025?0.014) were in general longer than the internal branches (mean length: 0.005?0.005), possibly suggesting a high growth rate for CRF33_01B during the early phase of the epidemic [48]. In addition, tree topology showed the dissemination of HIV-1 CRF33_01B from PWIDs to other risk groups including the low-risk populations, notably among children who acquired infections through their mothers. B, The Bayesian skyline plot estimated the past population dynamics of CRF33_01B among various risk groups in Malaysia using the CRF33_01Bpol data set of 242 sequences mentioned above (and also in the text). The x-axis represents the time (in units of year) and y-axis represents the effective population size of CRF33_01B. The thick solid line in the plot represents the median estimate and the shaded region represents the 95% highest posterior density (HPD) credible region. The Bayesian skyline plot revealed an exponential increase in effective number of CRF33_01B infections in the host population since its reported emergence around 1991 to 1993 [31] until early 2000s and remained stable thereafter at a high prevalence, suggesting persistent viral transmission and endemicity of CRF33_01B among various risk groups in Malaysia."

Colored branches indicate electroreceptive lineages possessing electroreceptors: as modified mucous glands (orange); of the ampullary sense organ type (deep blue); of both the tuberous sense organ type and the ampullary sense organ type found in teleosts (yellow). White branches signify non-electroreceptive lineages following secondary loss of electroreceptive capability; four (possibly five) such losses are indicated by white hash marks. The origins of different forms of electroreception are indicated by black hash marks. The electroreceptive conditions of the ancestors of the Craniata and of the clade (hagfishes, lampreys) are unresolved (indicated with grey and question marks) because there are several equi-parsimonious hypotheses concerning them. The end bud electroreceptor of the lampreys and the ampullary electroreceptor of the basal gnathostomes are anatomically very different, suggesting independent origins. The tree does not map atypical reports of electroreceptive gains in single species, which are in need of further study, such as tuberous electroreceptors in a blind catfish [146]. Recently, Czech-Damal et al. [147] discovered a novel sensory organ and possible electroreceptors associated with the hairless vibrissal crypts on the snout of the Guiana Dolphin (Sotalia guianensis), which appear to be sensitive to weak D.C. electric fields on the order of 4.6 microvolts per cm. Although their studies so far involve only one captive specimen trained to respond to the presence or absence of weak electric fields, it indeed suggests that additional research is needed on the sensory capabilities of aquatic mammals that might have independently evolved electroreception.

Numbers indicate bootstrap values supporting each node (n=100), and no significant differences were found between ML and NJ analyses.

Grey circumferential arcs represent chromosomes, with Cyp26b1 in green on Mmu6, Cyp26a1 in red on Mmu19, and Cyp26c1 in blue on Mmu19. Colored lines link orthologous regions in zebrafish chromosomes Dre7, Dre12 and Dre17, the sites of cyp26b1, cyp26a1 and cyp26c1 genes, respectively. (C–E) Clusters of synteny conservation reveal the presence of many gene neighbor orthologs shared between each Cyp26 genomic neighborhood in mouse and zebrafish cyp26b1 (C: cluster ID#265419 according to the Synteny Database), cyp26a1 (D: cluster ID#258723) and cyp26c1 (E: cluster ID#265367). These results rule out the possibility of reciprocal gene losses in zebrafish and mouse that could mask actual orthologous relationships in artifactual phylogenetic trees, and provide strong support for the conclusion that the zebrafish/mouse gene pairs called cyp26a1/Cyp26a1 and cyp26b1/Cyp26b1 are in fact orthologs. F: Gene clusters of synteny conservation (cluster ID#191383) between Dre12 and Dre17 reveal that the genomic neighborhoods of cyp26a1 and cyp26c1 are paralogous due to the teleost genome duplication (TGD, R3) that preceded the divergence of the teleost lineage after it split from the tetrapod branch. Duplicates of cyp26a1 and cyp26c1 in Dre17 and Dre12 were lost reciprocally after the teleost genome duplication (labeled with crosses) in contrast to, for instance, reep3 paralogs (in pink) that were maintained adjacent to cyp26 paralogs."

"pone.0014810.g001.png","Asymmetric hybridization hypothesis developed by Tosi et al. [43] to explain incongruent gene trees in Asian macaque monkeys (genus Macaca).Asymmetric hybridization is shown by arrows that indicate when males of one species breed with females of another. The male and female hybrid offspring then breed back with the maternal species only. The Y chromosome is a contiguous DNA fragment inherited solely through the paternal lineage. Because of chance processes or female preference, the admixed Y chromosomes become typical of the descendent species, resulting in the bottom phylogeny for Y chromosomes. Note the shifted positions of Macaca fascicularis and Macaca sinica. This evolutionary process can take multiple generations and involves multiple transmission events. The physical linkage of Y chromosome DNA is the mechanism that produces the transfer of Y chromosomes as a coherent unit and the resultant gene-tree incongruence. Analogously, any mechanism in cultural transmission that produces a necessary linkage of traits during transmission events could result in similar forms of tree incongruence. (modified from [43])."

Significance is assessed by simulating a distribution of test scores under a model of neutral evolution, taking the real phylogeny into account and using the False Discovery Rate approach to correct for multiple testing. For each species and functional category, we use chi-squared tests to evaluate whether the species is enriched or impoverished for functional divergence in that category, and then cluster species according to similarities in their profile across all 19 categories.

The percentages at the other seven tip nodes were inferred by the presence or absence of the orthologs of the two human proteins making up the PPI (Methods). We then inferred the states of the internal nodes under the assumption that a given PPI ortholog pair could appear only once in the phylogeny (Methods). The topology was visualized using FigTree [61]. Branch lengths are the mean Ks value (e.g., number of synonymous substitutions per synonymous site) found across the genes surveyed for that branch of the tree (See Methods). The five colored branches indicate potential origin points for a PPI under our limited parsimony model (Methods), while the two gray branches were used to estimate the rate of PPI loss. The dashed branches indicate the fact the Ks values could not be distinguished for these two branches because the models used produce unrooted trees.

Figure 2B shows the partial regressions used to calculate components a, b, c and d; first, we calculated the estimated and residual values (ecoest and ecores) for a regression between body size and the ecological data; then, we regressed body size and the phylogenetic data and saved the estimated and residual values (phyest and phyres); finally, we computed the regression between body size and both the ecological and the phylogenetic data to obtain the percentages of the variance explained (R2 of the regression method) by the ecological component [a], the niche conservatism b, the phylogenetic component [c] (phylogeny) and the unexplained variation d (unexplained variation), following the procedure proposed by Desdevises et al.

"pone.0029811.g003.png","Evolution of RNAi sensitivity in the Caenorhabditis genus. The RNAi results are displayed on the phylogeny from [17], for the different dsRNA administration methods and for different genes. The red stars indicate a loss of sensitivity to ingested Oti-actin dsRNAs in a parsimonious evolutionary scenario (see text). Note that the absence of an external Oti-actin RNAi response may correspond to an inability to respond either to all ingested dsRNAs (as in C. briggsae and likely in C. drosophilae), or only to specific dsRNAs (as in C. elegans JU1580 and C. angaria). In blue: results from [13]. In green: result`s from [5]. The dsRNAs for the ama-1 gene were specific to the tested species. We did not find differences among different tested isolates of C. briggsae and C. sp. 7 (see Materials and Methods for the identity of other tested strains), nor did Winston et al. for different isolates of C. brenneri [5]. C. brenneri can respond to ama-1 dsRNAs if they are injected into the gonad, indicating that this species is defective in the systemic spread of the signal from body cavity to gonad.

In (a), as there is no morphological change over the duration of the ancestral taxon A, there can be no true synapomorphies which would unite any pair of the sampled taxa (ancestor A or its descendants B and C) to the exclusion of a third. In (b), the taxa with a dashed outline (taxa A and B) have not been sampled and are not included in the supposed cladistic analysis. However, even though A and B are ancestral, the sampled taxa are all descended from the same persistent ancestor and thus no synapomorphy exists to produce an additional nested clade. This causes the node to be intrinsically unresolvable. In (c), under a bifurcating cladogenesis pattern, polytomies are only produced when the ancestor A is sampled, as each morphotaxon can only have two descendants. The fourth example (d) is an example with cryptic cladogenesis and anagenesis, where the formation of several sampled descendants from a cryptic ancestral complex of multiple undifferentiated lineages produces an unresolvable set of relationships.

Human mutations [66] at key residues 61, 112 and 158 are in red. Including residue 61, the human APOE protein has four fixed, Homo-specific, non-synonymous mutations, all of which seem to be shared with the Denisovan hominin (inferred from reads mapped to the human genome at http://www.genome.ucsc.edu). The chimpanzee APOE protein is monomorphic within and between subspecies, and is identical to the bonobo APOE protein.

All sequences are represented by taxon names showing species and NCBI accession numbers. The evolutionary history was inferred using the Neighbor-Joining method [106]. An optimal tree with percentage of replicate trees in which the associated taxa clustered together in the bootstrap test (1000 replicates) is shown next to the branches [107]. The tree is drawn to scale, with branch lengths in the same units as those of the evolutionary distances used to infer the phylogenetic tree. The evolutionary distances were computed using the JTT matrix based method [108] and are in the units of the number of amino acid substitutions per site. All positions containing alignment gaps and missing data were eliminated only in pairwise sequence comparisons (Pairwise deletion option). There were a total of 1884 positions in the final dataset. Phylogenetic analyses were conducted in MEGA3.1 [94]. Four radiations (shaded) represent relationship of vertebrate proteins NLG1-4 compared with invertebrate proteins. The phylogeny shows vertebrate and invertebrate neuroligin radiations arise from a single common ancestor found in the sea urchin (S. purpuratus XP_001192426), and displays a congruent topology with the Maximum-Likelihood tree reported by Bolliger et al. [105]. Similar analysis was performed for investigating neurexin phylogeny. (1.2) shows the evolutionary relationship of two ancestrally related clades of neurexin proteins from vertebrates and invertebrates; the neurological neurexins (NrxI) and neurexin IV (also known as neurexin).

"pone.0000847.g002.png","Codon-pair context is species specific.A) Individual codon-pair context maps built for various genomes followed phylogeny indicating that codon-pair context is species specific. For instance, the human ORFeome map is more similar to that of chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) than to the mouse (Mus musculus) map. B) This result was confirmed using differential display maps (DDM) that subtract two codon-pair context maps. For example, H. sapiens–M. musculus (H.s vs M.m); H. sapiens–P. troglodytes (H.s vs P.t). In these differential display maps major codon-pair context differences (above 15) are shown in light blue and darker maps correspond to species with more similar codon-pair context biases. In the present example, the maps of H.s vs M.m and H.s vs P.t have 6% and 1% of blue cells, respectively. C and D) The same phylogenetical relationship could be detected for bacterial ORFeomes, as exemplified for Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus and Salmonella typhi. The DDM built with these species have 55% (E.c vs B.c) and 20% (E.c vs S.t) of blue cells. E) Finally, the phylogenetical relationship was maintained when the above species were clustered according to the similarities of the codon-pair context maps. The yeasts Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe were added to include an intermediate group of lower eukaryotes in the tree. Adjusted residuals are colored in the maps according to the color scale shown, so that green cells correspond to preferred and red cells to rejected contexts."

"pone.0021086.g003.png","Estimated ages of the major eusocial insect clades. Colored boxes indicate the time period in which the eusocial members of the clade are estimated to have originated. All estimates are based on fossil calibrated divergence time analyses except for the eusocial Vespidae, which is based on the fossil of a polistine nest from the Late Cretaceous [66]. This fossil provides a minimum age for the origin of eusocial wasps which probably originated sometime in the mid-Cretaceous [67]. Molecular studies, however, have indicated that the eusocial vespids do not form a monophyletic group and instead represent two independent eusocial lineages [84]. There is also uncertainty in the phylogenetic placement of ants relative to bees and vespids. The traditional relationships are depicted here, with ants more closely related to vespids than to bees [85], although a more recent molecular analysis suggests that ants share a more recent common ancestor with bees than vespids [86]. Termites are estimated to have originated sometime between 180 and 230 Mya [70], ants between 115 and 135 Mya [69], corbiculates 87 Mya (78 to 95 Mya), allodapines 53 Mya (41 to 65 Mya), eusocial Halictus (Halict.) 21 Mya (15 to 28 Mya) [71], eusocial Lasioglossum (Lasiogl.) 22 Mya (15 to 29 Mya) [71], and eusocial Augochlorini (Augochl.) 20 Mya (12 to 29 Mya) [71]."

Square nodes indicate the novel alleles identified from the Srahrevagh River, Co. Mayo. Parallel lines indicate splits in the network. Bootstrap support values (1000 replicates) are presented for the most relevant splits in the network. Large loops imply areas of phylogenetic uncertainty or reticulations. The frequency of these in the network implies that recombination is an important factor in the evolution of Satr-UBA, predominantly between the α1 and α2 domains. Conversely, good bootstrap support for splits involving several closely related Satr-UBA alleles is suggestive of conventional radiation by point mutation. Roman numerals (α1/α2) indicate the lineages to which each Satr-UBA allele's α1 and α2 sequence belongs (see also Figures 5 and 6). B) Neighbour-joining tree rooted on the midpoint for salmonid UBA amino acid sequences with bootstrap support (1,000 replicates) shown for nodes with 50% support or greater.

Species that are in neither community are left blank. All branch lengths are set to one and all species are scored as present or absent in this simplified example. It is important to note that in each of the four scenarios there is a complete turnover of species between the two communities, but the degree of phylogenetic beta diversity varies. Scenario A indicates species in the blue community are closely related to one another, but distantly related to the species in the orange community. This is an example of ‘basal’ phylogenetic turnover. Scenario B also indicates species in the blue community are closely related to one another, but distantly related to the species in the orange community. The main difference in that Scenario B has a much lower level of ‘basal’ phylogenetic beta diversity than that in Scenario A. Scenario C indicates locally phylogenetically overdispersed communities that have little phylogenetic beta diversity. Scenario D also indicates local phylogenetic overdispersion and low phylogenetic beta diversity. In both scenarios phylogenetic beta diversity measured using a nearest neighbor metric will be lower than when measured using a pairwise metric that considers the basal portion of the phylogeny and this effect will be maximized in Scenario C."

Photosynthetic stramenopiles and apicomplexans+ possessed the vertically transferred GapC1 genes. The ancestral dinoflagellates replaced the “vertical” GapC1 gene by a laterally acquired homologue from an unknown stramenopile species. We also assume two lateral GapC1 gene transfer events — one between an unknown stramenopile species and the ancestral cryptophyte cells, and the other between an unknown member of apicomplexan+ and the ancestral haptophyte cells. The three LGT events were highlighted by red arrows. Putative replacements of plastid-targeted GAPDH took place after the lateral gene transfers (black arrows). The original type of plastid-targeted GAPDH enzymes in a common ancestor of cryptophytes and haptophytes remains uncertain.

(A) Shows the six combinations of 2DL5 and 2DS3/5 present in the 27 haplotypes, along with the motif to which they belong. Shading denotes their relatedness as determined by the phylogenetic analyses shown in panel B. (B) Genomic sequences extending from 5′ of 2DL5 through the end of the neighboring 2DS3/5 gene were aligned, divided into three regions (5′, central, and 3′) and submitted to phylogenetic analysis. Neighbor joining trees are shown, with Bootstrap values for the nodes. For the 5′ region (from 250 bp 5′ of 2DL5 exon 1 through to the end of intron 2), the variants divide according to their location in the centromeric or telomeric half of the KIR locus. The central region (from exon 3 of 2DL5 to 1.9 kb 5′ of exon 6 in 2DS3S5) divides according to association with 2DS3 or 2DS5. In the 3′ segment (from intron 6 to the polyadenylation signal at the end of 2DS3S5) the variants containing 2DS3*001 form an outgroup. (C) Shows two models for the evolution of 2DS3 and 2DS5. Both models start with a single 2DL5A/B-2DS3/5 progenitor in the centromeric region, the only site where chimpanzee and orangutan 2DL5 has been found ([65] and AC220148). This progenitor then duplicated, with one daughter being transposed to the telomeric region. Subsequent diversification at the two loci resulted in distinct 2DL5A, 2DL5B, 2DS3 and 2DS5 genes. The two models differ in the sites where 2DS3 and 2DS5 arose: in model 1, 2DS5 arose in the centromeric site, 2DS3 in the telomeric site, whereas in model 2, 2DS3 arose in the centromeric site, 2DS5 in the telomeric site. Subsequent recombination between variants in the centromeric and telomeric sites gave rise to the variants observed in the modern KIR haplotypes. Model 2 requires only two such recombinations and is more parsimonious than model 1, which requires three. However, the greater diversity observed in 2DL5B-2DS5 than 2DL5A-2DS5, favors model 1 over model 2."

The next phylogenetic step resulted in clades Atlantogenata and Boreoeutheria. The only (predicted) sequence we found belonging to Atlantogenata (elephant) shows a 7–8 amino acid longer cytoplasmic domain as compared to Marsupials. Boreoeutheria is composed of the sister taxa Laurasiatheria and Euarchontoglires. Species belong to Euarchontoglires analyzed so far (human, chimp, gorilla, orangutan, gibbon, rhesus, marmoset, lemur, rabbit, pika, squirrel, hamster, rat and mouse) preserved these extra amino acids of the FcRn C-terminal with the exception of the guinea pig (based on its predicted amino acid sequence). Rabbit lost five amino acids in a more N-terminal (or middle) part of the cytoplasmic domain. As pika (Ochotona), another Lagomorphs, possesses these residues, the five amino acid deletion is thus specific of either rabbit or Leporidae family. Animals belong to the Laurasiatheria clade (bovine, sheep, pig, horse, bat, dog and panda) lost 10 amino acids of their FcRn C-terminals. Phylogenetic tree was created based on Prasad et al.

"pone.0022404.g001.png","Hypothesis of parallel genetic evolution at the Tb1 locus for the adaptation of vegetative branching during maize and pearl millet domestication. A. The phylogenetic tree shows that Zea mays and Pennisetum glaucum are two wild grasses from the Panicoid sub-family that separated 30 million years ago (dotted lines, scale not respected), wild Z.mays (teosinte) growing in America and wild P.glaucum in Africa. About 9,000–4,000 years ago, they were independently domesticated into maize and pearl millet, respectively. Pictures below the tree illustrate the parallel morphological evolution of both wild progenitors during their domestication, in particular the reduction of tillering and branching. Z.mays and P.glaucum inherited from their most recent common ancestor the orthologous copies ZmTb1 and PgTb1of the developmental gene Tb1 (represented by a hatched box). It was previously shown that ZmTb1 has been targeted by human selection for the reduction of maize branching during domestication. We ask whether PgTb1 was subjected to parallel evolutionary processes for the similar adaptation of branching during the domestication of pearl millet. B. Distribution of the number of tillers and branches in domesticated pearl millet, wild P.glaucum and weedy plants grown in the same location in south Niger. The cultivated field and the wild population were in parapatric situation. Plants present in the field were classified as domestic or as weedy according to farmer's classification. The ability of weedy pearl millets to shed their seeds spontaneously at the maturity stage is one of the main factors used by farmers to recognize them [13]. Histograms show that domestication was associated with a reduction of vegetative branching. These data were obtained on more than 200 plants for the wild and the domestic pearl millets repectively, and more than 150 plants for weedy phenotypes. C. Tillering in young P.glaucum seedlings. At 4 weeks after germination, tillers are visible in wild P.glaucum (left) but not in the Souna domesticated landrace (right). Close-ups after dissection reveal that axillary meristems have developed into an emergent tiller in the wild plant (arrow) but remain dormant as buds with 1 or 2 leaves (arrow) or undeveloped meristems (box) in the cultivated landrace."

The top clade is ambiguous because of four sequence losses (2Gm, 1Mt, 1Cf), so did not contribute to counts toward any of the four hypotheses. The second is consistent with H2a, but is weak evidence: it has three sequence losses (2Mt, Cf), and has bootstrap value of 43% on placement of Cf. The third clade has two sequence losses (Mt, Cf), and is consistent with H1a. Figure 3B: lactoylglutathione lyase protein family. The first clade is “complete” and supports H1a. The second clade is missing four sequences, so contributed to none of the hypotheses. The third clade, with two sequence losses (Mt, Cf), is consistent with H2a (though is weak evidence, considering the bootstrap value of 26% on placement of Cf). Figure 3C: RmlC-type cupin family (cl5891, Table S3). Neither of the legume clades were counted by the automated methods, but on visual examination, they are weakly consistent with H1a and H2a, respectively. The first clade likely has misordered sequences Glyma16g04150, Glyma17g24120 (which derive from the recent WGD and should group together), and MtAC148965_5. This pattern is closest to H1a if the Mt sequence, with bootstrap support of 51%, groups with one of the Gm clades. The Cf sequence, with high bootstrap value, is in an outgroup position with respect to the papilionoid sequences. The second clade, with two sequence losses (both Mt), is consistent with H2a (though is weak evidence, considering the bootstrap value of 47% on placement of Cf)."

At the ends of the branches are representatives of each taxon, and adjacent to these are schematic diagrams illustrating the expression of Hh and Gli genes at key developmental stages, with arrows indicating the predicted direction of hedgehog signalling. Labelling on branches of the tree indicates predicted ancestral gene complement (in black) or actual gene complement in living taxa (in red). Single Hh and Gli genes are predicted to have been present in the common ancestor of the Deuterostomes. In the Ambulacraria (represented by the echinoderm Lytechinus variegatus and the hemichordate Saccoglossus kowalevskii), these genes do not appear to have duplicated, though hemichordate Gli has yet to be isolated. The spatial expression of Gli genes is unreported in Ambulacraria, however Hh expression has been reported as localised to the apical tip in S. kowalevskii and to the endoderm in L. variegatus. In the Chordata, midline Hh expression is observed in all three lineages, with corresponding Gli expression in adjacent tissues (though note neural restriction of Hh and Gli in C. intestinalis, indicating the loss of notochord Hh and associated mesodermal Gli expression from this lineage). Adjacent to the B. floridae and M. musculus diagrams are simplified representations of the diversity of activator and repressor forms of Gli present in each lineage.

"pone.0036546.g004.png","Influence of alignment filtering.(A) Random filtering and phylogenetic filtering both remove sequences from the unfiltered alignment, which is represented by the large tree a, but result in trees (b and c) that differ in the length of terminal branches (red). Tree b (random filter) is similar to a in containing many extremely short terminal branches that are known to challenge coevolution detectors. In contrast, tree c (phylogenetic filter) lacks short terminal branches. (B) Opposing effects of progressively increasing strength of filtering, which leaves gradually fewer sequences in the alignment. The top graph shows, for the phylogenetic filter, the minimal sequence-sequence distance among all sequence pairs in the filtered alignment. The two lower graphs show performance, measured by , of a coevolution detector for both the phylogenetic and random filter. The first effect, specific to the phylogenetic filter, is a rise of with increasing strength of filtering (decreasing number remaining sequences). This reflects the disappearance of short terminal branches, which in turn improves performance, until a maximum is reached around 250 sequences remaining. The second effect is the deterioration of performance with increasing strength of filtering, since fewer sequences provide less information for the coevolution detector. This effect is clearly seen for the random filter regardless of the number of remaining sequences but it becomes apparent for the phylogenetic filter only with strong filtering.

"pone.0032776.g001.png","Experimental strategy. The flow diagram in the left describes the phylogenetic reconstruction of trees of rRNA molecules and substructures. The structures of rRNA molecules were first decomposed into substructures, including helical stem tracts and unpaired regions. Structural features of these substructures (e.g., length) were coded as phylogenetic characters and assigned character states according to an evolutionary model that polarizes character transformation towards an increase in molecular order (character argumentation). Coded characters (s) are arranged in data matrices, which can be transposed for cladistic analyses. Phylogenetic analysis using MP methods generate rooted phylogenetic trees of either molecules or substructures. Only trees of substructures are presented in this study. The flow diagram in the right shows the reconstruction of trees of proteomes and trees of protein domain structures. A census of domain structures in proteomes of hundreds of completely sequenced organisms is used to compose a data matrix and its transposed matrix, which are then used to build phylogenomic trees describing the evolution of individual protein structures and entire molecular repertoires, respectively. Elements of the matrix (g) represent genomic abundances of architectures (at FSF level of hierarchical classification of structure) in proteomes. Trees of proteomes will be described elsewhere, but are largely congruent with traditional classification. Embedded in the tree of rRNA substructures and tree of protein domains are timelines that assign age to molecular structures. These ages can be “painted” onto 2D or 3D structural models of the ribosome, generating evolutionary heat maps. Evolutionary information from RNA and protein structures is finally combined to generate a model of structural evolution."

Additionally, the A group cluster is arranged entirely sequentially [B] whereas the pathogenic B cluster is split into four different regions throughout chromosome 1 (the B. mallei cluster is split into 5 regions)[C]. The fla1 gene cluster is responsible for Burkholderia motility on soft agar, but not for intracellular motility or plaque formation in models of infection [32].

"pone.0014547.g003.png","Fish-centric models of DIA1-family evolution.In both models (A and B), the genome of the hypothetical chordate ancestor encodes two DIA1-family genes: DIA1 and DIA1L. The DIA1L gene has been ‘lost’ in the urochordate/vertebrate lineage, preceding the 1/2R whole genome duplications (WGDs). A duplicated copy of DIA1, which we have called DIA1R, was retained subsequent to the 1/2R WGD event, with both DIA1 and DIA1R identified in lamprey, fish, and tetrapod genomes. In the fish lineage, however, two different models, (A) and (B), could account for our current knowledge of DIA1 family members. In model (A), the DIA1 duplication generating DIA1a and DIA1b coincides with the 3R WGD. Two lineage-specific ‘losses’ of DIA1a have then occurred: the first in the G. morhua lineage, and the second in the Protacanthopterygian/Acathopterygian lineage. There are too few data available to determine whether the channel catfish encodes DIA1a, DIA1b, both, or neither. In model (B), the DIA1 duplication leading to DIA1a and DIA1b in ostariophysans does not coincide with 3R but, instead, is specific to the ostariophysan lineage. Both model (A) and (B) both predict DIA1R gene loss in the acanthopterygian lineage. Proposed rounds of WGD [43], [164], [165] are indicated by filled black spheres: numbering of the WGDs is provide in black boxes: those occurring early in the vertebrate lineage marked as 1R/2R and that in the ray-finned fish lineage marked as 3R.

Comparisons between the variable content of all the strains were plotted as percentages of similarity on the heatmap using Gegenees (version 1.1.4). The percentage of similarity was used to generate a phylogenomic tree with SplitsTree (version 4.12.6).

"pone.0007815.g002.png","Maximum parsimony phylogeny based on concatenates of 89 gene sequences from 108 MTBC strains from global sources as previously reported [31].Six main lineages can be observed within the human MTBC (numbered 1 to 6 and indicated in different colours). As shown previously, these lineages are highly congruent to the ones defined based on genomic deletions or large sequence polymorphisms (LSPs) [31], [33], [34]. Corresponding spoligotyping data for each strain are shown on the right, where black squares indicate the presence of a particular spacer and a white square the absence of a particular spacer (see Figure 1 for details on the methodology). Because the various typing techniques have classified MTBC strains into several lineages and strain families using differing nomenclatures, some of the traditional names are also shown. Some of the traditional groupings defined by spoligotyping correlate with SNP-based lineages (see also Table S1). For example, EAI (East-African-Indian) corresponds to the pink lineage, AFR1 and AFR2 correspond to the green and brown lineage, respectively (these strains are also known as M. africanum), and CAS (Central-Asian) corresponds to the purple lineage. However, other strain groupings defined by spoligotyping should be regarded as sub-lineages within the main lineages. For example, the ‘Beijing’ strain family is part of the blue lineage, and the five spoligotyping groups ‘Cameroon’, ‘Uganda’ ‘X’, ‘Haarlem’, and ‘LAM (Latin-American-Mediterranean)’ are sub-lineages within the main red lineage. This highlights another limitation of spoligotyping, which is that phylogenetic relationships between strain groupings cannot be defined. In addition, asterisks indicate spoligotyping patterns that cannot be classified at all using standard ‘signature patterns’ [26]. PGG1, PGG2, and PGG3 indicate Principal Genetic Group 1, 2, and 3, respectively. The PGG nomenclature is based on two SNPs originally described by Sreevatsan at al. [7]. Comparison to the MLSA data shows these groups are not phylogenetically equivalent as most of the MTBC diversity groups within PGG1, and PGG3 includes only a small subset of strains."

The SERA gene family has common exon/intron structure: four exons and three introns, with some exceptions. Group I SERA genes have six exons and five introns structure, except for Pfa-SERA8 and Pvi-SERA12, which lack one intron. SERA genes of Group IV Clade 2 and Pma-SERA1 have no third intron and consist of three exons and two introns. Group I SERA genes of three rodent parasites have an extra intron near the 5′-end. Pkn-SERA1 gene in Clade 1 contains three stop codons, causing truncation of the cysteine-rich conserved domain; but since this gene was expressed, we consider this is a SERA gene. TSERA1 genes have truncations of the protease domain, variable domain 2 and cysteine-rich conserved domain. Pco-TSERA2, Pkn-TSERA2 and Pfr-TSERA2 lack a long amino acid region (498 residues) including the enzyme domain (Figure S4), of which Pfr-TSERA2 seems to be a putative pseudogene because its 2nd exon contains two stop codons."

"pone.0006787.g005.png","Phylogenetic relationships among the 5′-UT exons of the IRGA genes.A. Alignment of the putative 5′ exons of the IRGA genes. Irga5, which is not listed, is a degraded pseudogene without transcript [10] (see also below). The 5′ exons fall into two sequence classes homologous to the exon 1A and exon 1B of Irga6 respectively. Exon 1A and 1B of Irga6 have been presented in detail in Figure S1. Exon 1 of Irga3, Irga4, and Irga8 are all inferred from EST sequences and confirmed against the chromosome 18 genomic contig NT_039674.7. The predicted exon 1 of Irga7 is derived by homology from the other 1A exons. It is positioned and oriented correctly relative to the Irga7 gene but has not yet been recovered from an EST pool. B. Average distance phylogram based on percentage identity, relating the exon 1 sequences of the IRGA family of genes shown in Fig. 5A above. The numbers recorded above each branch give the percentage difference in sequence along the branch. The distinction between 1A and 1B exons is clear. The predicted exon 1 of Irga7 is an outlier in the 1A group, consistent with the possibility that Irga7 is a pseudogene (see Fig. 5C ). C. Scale map of the IRGA gene cluster on chromosome 18 of the C57BL/6 mouse. The complete sequence domain of the IRGA genes was extracted from the chromosome 18 genomic contig, NT_039674.7. The length of the whole cluster from the 5′ nucleotide of exon 1 of Irga1 to the 3′ nucleotide of the ORF of Irga8 is 230,910 nucleotides. In each case, the position of the 5′-UT exon 1 is shown in black and the long exon 2 containing the ORF in red. Arrows above each 5′ exon indicate the direction of transcription. The 3′-UT region of exon 2 is not indicated. The homology group, 1A or 1B (see Fig. 5A and 5B above), is indicated for each 5′-UT exon. The 1B exon upstream of Irga1 is found associated only with ESTs (e.g. AK149583.1 and AK149556.1) containing the ORF of Irga2, indicated by the oblique transcription orientation arrow. The ORF of Irga1 itself is interrupted by two frame shifts and cannot generate a full-length Irga1 protein. Furthermore, Irga1 is found in databases exclusively associated with incorrectly-spliced ESTs (e.g. BI658674, BG915086). The transcriptional orientation indicator for Irga2 shows no terminal arrowhead because although the 1B exon of Irga2 is clearly identified by homology no transcripts have been found containing this exon. Irga2 is found exclusively associated with exon 1 of Irga1. Irga5 was described as a pseudogene earlier [10]. The long exon was identified by homology to exon 2 of other IRGA genes but contains no full-length ORF. No ESTs have been described from Irga5 and no 5′-UT exon 1 could be identified by homology to either exon 1A or 1B. Irga7 encodes a full-length ORF in exon 2, and the 5′-UT was readily identifiable by homology. However no ESTs encoding Irga7 have been found and no transcripts corresponding to Irga7 were detected in IFN-stimulated L929 fibroblasts (Bekpen, 2005). Thus Irga7 is probably a pseudogene in the C57BL/6 mouse and in L929 (C3H/An strain) fibroblasts."

"pone.0004357.g001.png","The Fungal species tree.A) Phylogenetic tree representing the evolutionary relationships among the 60 fungal species considered in the study, as resulting from the ML analysis of the concatenated alignment of 69 widespread proteins. Numbers on the nodes indicate two different types of support values. The first number indicates the phylome support for that node, that is, the percentage of trees in the phylome that support the specific arrangement of the three or four groups of species defined by its daughter nodes (see B). An asterisk next to this number indicates that the topology obtained by the species tree is not the most common among the trees in the phylome. Whenever there is a second number (in bold), this indicates the bootstrap support when this is lower than 100. Partitions that do not have this second number have a bootstrap support of 100. Branches with dashed lines indicate evolutionary relationships that are supported by less than 50% of the trees in the phylome. B) Schematic representation of the two types of support values for the different nodes in the tree. X indicates the phylome support for the specific topology indicated by that node. Two types of nodes do exist attending to the number of partitions delimited by their daughter nodes. A first class of nodes (top), delimit relative topologies of three partitions (A, B and C), whereas a second class (bottom) delimit four partitions (A, B, C and D). Phylome support values indicate the percentage of trees that show exactly the relative grouping of the three or four groups delimited by the node. This percentage is expressed over the fraction of trees that contain at least one species from each of the partitions considered. The second number (Y) indicates the bootstrap support for the partition delimited by that node, but does not provide specific support for the specific arrangement of the sub-partitions within that partition. C) Correlation between the fungal species tree topologies recovered by the individual trees included in the concatenated alignment (Y axis) and all the trees in the phylome (X axis). In both cases the fraction of trees that are compatible with a given topology, as computed with the topology scanning algorithm, is represented."

"pone.0022099.g001.png","The assessment of possible OGDs on the tree. The calculation of OGDs involves the assessment of the likelihood of the placement of every branch of the unrooted tree at every possible position for each of the gene families separately. 1) The branch leading to Species A and B is to be assessed and is pruned. It is then replaced at every possible position on the remaining tree (I to V above) and the likelihood of each is assessed. 2) When all likelihoods have been assessed the expected likelihood weight (ELW) of each is calculated. If any placement except the original position receives an ELW of at least 0.65 (implying high support) this is considered a putative transfer event (as in IV above). The branch with the best placement is considered the donor and the recipient is the branch that was assessed at each position (A and B above). 3) To be considered an OGD the path-length distance of the original position of the clade to its best placement is calculated. If this distance is greater than 0.4 (thereby avoiding the possibility of wrongly identifying phylogenetic uncertainty as an OGD), the placement is considered a putative OGD."

Strain names as well as the defining splits having a bootstrap support of greater than 85% are printed in the same colors as in Figure 2. Clustering based on gene content distance and maximum parsimony results in the same eight genome groups. Serogroup B and C strains as well as the two cnl strains are separated from the other four serogroups based on gene content, and the cycles within the serogroup B/C subgraph indicate a high rate of gene transfer among these strains. Strains from the same CC always reside on common splits. B) Neighbor-net representation based on the concatenated alignments of the seven housekeeping gene fragments form the meningococcal core genome used for MLST comprising 383 parsimony informative sites. A MLSA-based clustering of strains results in the separation of strains from the same serogroup or belonging to the same GGs. The large number of cycles in the graph indicates a high rate of homologous recombination among the genes used for MLST and that a MLSA-based reconstruction of the deep phylogeny of these strains is not possible."

In figure 1, EDA = EDB = 10/2+2/1 = 7, and EDC = EDD = 2/2+10/1 = 11. Each species is in a different category of extinction risk (in the rank order of imperilment D,A,B,C ), and these categories have been transformed to prob(extinction) under two scenarios: in the first (power) transformation of extinction categories (Transformation 1), the rank order under EDGE is D (2.2), A (1.4), B(1.0) and C(0.8). With the second (linear) transformation (Transformation 2), C and B switch ranks: D(1.7), A(1.0), C(0.8), and B(0.7). HEDGEi is also a product of two terms: the expected phylogenetic contribution of a species i given prob(extinction) of all other species, and prob(extinction)i. However, HEDGE can also be formulated as the change in the total expected PD [28] from the status quo to the expected PD if one sets the prob(extinction)i = 0, ie. if species i is preserved [15]. The expected PD of a tree can be calculated as the sum of edge lengths, each weighted by its probability of persistence [8]. For example, the expected PD under transformation 1 is 2*0.4+2*0.6+10*(1−0.6*0.4)+0.2*10+0.8*10+(1−0.2*0.8)*2 = 21.3; if we save C, it becomes 2*0.6+2*0.4+10*(1−0.6*0.4)+1*10+0.2*10+(1−0*0.8)*2 = 23.6, and HEDGEC = 23.6−21.3 = 2.3.

Scenario 1: A cnidarian-like ancestor with epithelial-muscle cells that form circular and longitudinal musculature form the orthogonal musculature of acoels. The musculature would be the first cell type of mesoderm [63]. Scenario 2: A similar cnidarian-like ancestor is forming myoepithelial coelomic cavities as outpouchings from the gastric cavity (according to enterocoely hypothesis [113]). In the lineage to the Acoelomorpha the orthogonal muscle grid of acoels is formed from the coeloms. After the formation of the muscle grid coeloms got reduced. This scenario includes several losses and gains and is thus not parsimonious and can be rejected. Scenario 3: In case the last common ancestor of Deuterostomia had coeloms, the coeloms got reduced in the lineage to the Acoelomorpha without any traces [12]. Scenario 4: Coelomic cavities of Ambulacraria are not homologous with those in other animal lineages [22] and are formed independently from the endoderm of a acoelomorph-like ancestor (e.g., by enterocoely)."

The cell lineage tree of an organism is a rooted labeled binary tree representing its development from a single cell until present time. Nodes (circles) represent cells (dead cells are crossed), and edges (lines) connect parent and daughter cells (dashed lines represent several divisions). Uncrossed leaves (nodes with no daughters) represent extant cells. Lineage trees are a snapshot of a specific timepoint, which constantly grow throughout embryonic development and the adult life of the organism. Any cell sample (colored leaves) induces a partial subtree, called the cell sample lineage tree (panel B). B. The genomic composition of cells in the sample tree at three MS loci is shown. Spontaneous somatic mutations (marked by X) in these loci are sufficient to encode the lineage relations between these cells. Cells that are genetically similar tend to share a longer common developmental path, consequently enabling phylogenetic analysis to reconstruct the tree. Although idealized mutations are depicted, even potential hampering factors (such as coincident mutations) are not expected to disrupt analysis if a sufficient number of loci are analyzed [1]. C.

Due to a paucity of sequence data, it is unclear whether a DIA1 homologue is absent from the Porifera (grey font). DIA1L was exclusively found in echinoderm and cephalochordate genomes (underlined), which also encode DIA1. DIA1L is absent from tunicates, but a current dearth of sequence data precludes evaluation of hemichordate genomes for DIA1L homologues (indicated by a dotted bold grey line on right hand side, and a lack of underline). A bold dotted black line (right-hand side) indicates that the presence of DIA1R has been confirmed in cartilaginous fish but, probably due to a lack of sequence data, DIA1 has yet to be identified in this class of chordates. Both a DIA1 and DIA1R gene are present in vertebrate genomes (bold font), with a notable absence of DIA1R in acanthopterygian fish (asterisk). Furthermore, two DIA1 paralogues were identified in the genomes of fish from the superorder Ostariophysi, but not in fish from other superorders (see Figure 3). Data for the schematic metazoan phylogeny were from numerous sources [157]–[163]. Proposed rounds of whole-genome duplication (WGD) are indicated by filled black spheres, where two WGDs occurred early in the vertebrate lineage (1R/2R) and a third WGD (3R) in the ray-finned fish lineage before the diversification of teleosts [43], [164], [165].

The leftmost part shows the percent nucleotide sequence differences calculated using MEGA5 to determine variant lineages according to a proposed taxonomic classification [18], [19].

The A1 lineage contains the reference HPV16 genome, the A2 lineage contains the E-G350 related variants, including the E1-1374∧63nt variant samples and the E-12 variant described in Bhattacharjee et al. [15]. The A3 sublineage contains only the E-G131 sample, which exhibits the most difference from other sequences.

"pone.0037135.g001.png","A flexible genotyping method can be used to optimize the number of genetic markers for a specific experimental approach in a given biological system.Segregating genetic markers are used to make inferences about historical processes (e.g., phylogenetic relationships, population structure) and functional mechanisms (e.g., genotype-phenotype mapping), but the optimal number of markers (fraction of the genome) needed to achieve a desired level of resolution differs based on both the experimental approach and the specific biological system–the number of genetic markers needed to recover relationships among populations or species is related to divergence among groups (e.g., more recent or more rapid events require more variable loci); the number of markers required for optimal resolution in phenotype-mapping experiments (conducted in laboratory crosses or pedigreed wild populations) is a function of the number of recombination events captured in the pedigree; the number of markers used in association mapping or selection scans in wild populations is determined by genome-wide levels of linkage disequilibrium, which is largely dictated by demographic history. Recent methods combining reduced representation library construction and next-gen sequencing (i.e., RADseq [6]) target an intermediate number of regions (shown schematically above).

The ‘BCH-only’ subgroups of plants and insects also descended from different ancestors. This is evident from their phylogenetic clustering and their gene-structure. Group-I BCH proteins/genes might have arisen after domain swapping events. Nematodes have only group-III BCH domain proteins, which are associated with a RhoGAP domain.

"pone.0068242.g001.png","Calculation of the Relative taxonomic resolving power index (Rtax) and Taxonomic index of congruence (Ctax).Calculations are exemplified on two distinct species delimitation approaches (X and Y) supporting different taxonomies. For a better understanding, calculations are first exemplified on a tree-based taxonomy (a). Although these calculations are based on a underlying phylogenetic perspective, knowledge of tree topology is not mandatory to perform the calculations (b). In (a), speciation event hypotheses supported by the approaches X and Y are represented by black and white circles, respectively. The Ctax between both approaches is defined as the ratio of the total number of speciation events congruently supported ( = shared) by both approaches (dark grey boxes), relative to the total number of speciation events cumulatively suggested by both approaches (in light grey boxes). The Rtax of a given approach represents the proportion of speciation events that it supports ( = single), relative to the complete set of speciation events (set of boundaries cumulatively revealed by all the different approaches – only two approaches in this example). In (b), representing the same taxonomy, the same calculations have been performed without relying on a phylogenetic tree, the number of speciation events being indirectly inferred from the number of species (in a dichotomic species tree, N cladogenetic speciation events = N species – 1). Little black dots represent specimens or populations, and each colored oval represents a distinct species hypothesis according to the approach (or combination of approaches) used."

A3 and C3 refer to the species pair T. podura and T. chumash, respectively. The ecotype pairs exhibit weaker divergence in morphology, host preference, and mtDNA than the species pair, and are also subject to divergent selection on fewer niche dimensions. A) Photographs of the three taxon pairs, and divergence in colour-pattern between them (brightness contrast, mean±95% C.I.). Host plants are also shown. B) Summary of divergence in host plant preferences and mtDNA (colours represent host plant use). Δ%C refers to the difference between each taxon pair in the percent of individuals choosing Ceanothus over Adenostoma in host preference trials [data from 78, 72, and the current study for T. cristinae ecotypes, T. podura ecotypes, and the species pair, respectively]. The phylogenetic trees are schematic for simplicity. The patterns depicted were robust to alternative methods for tree construction [75], [81 for details]. C) The nature of selection on crypsis and physiology for each taxon pair. For crypsis, the term ‘survival’ is used as a general y-axis label, representing the fitness of each insect host form on each host species. For ecotypes, the y-axes specifically represent 1- the proportion of insects eaten in predation trials with scrub jays [data from 72]. For the species pair, the y-axis specifically represents the proportion of each insect species on each host plant at the end of the field experiment (shown in more detail in Fig. 2). Further evidence that selection is exerted by visual predation stems from the observation that: (a) survival was measured using predation trials, or (b) divergent selection in manipulative field experiments was detected in the presence, but not in the absence, of visual predation [see also 70], [71]. For physiology, the y-axis represents lifetime fecundity in all cases (data on survival for the species pair are also reported in Fig. 2). The data depicted can be used to infer the presence versus absence of divergent selection, but should not be used to quantitatively compare the strength of selection (because somewhat different experimental procedures were used among taxa). For simplicity, error bars were removed for the current figure, but are depicted in Fig. 2. See text for statistical details."

(A) The pathway is classified into three groups based on the enzymatic activity and subcellular localization. Plastidial terpene cyclases convert the precursor geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGDP) into ent-copalyl diphosphate (CDP), and subsequently into ent-kaurene, in a two-step process catalyzed by ent-copalyl diphosphate synthase (CPS) and ent-kaurene synthase (KS). Cytochrome P-450 mono-oxygenases such as ent-kaurene oxidase (KO), ent-kaurenoic acid oxidase (KAO) yield GA12. Cytoplasmic dioxygenases are responsible for the latest steps and conversion to bioactive gibberellins and their inactive catabolites. GA12 in potato is early 13-hydroxylated by GA 13-oxidase (GA13ox).

A) Codon-context conservation in fungi was determined by calculating the percentage of preferred or repressed codon contexts that showed bias conservation in the aligned sequences of each organism versus S. cerevisiae (red bars in the graphs). The percentage of conservation of the first codon of the pair between both sequences is shown in blue bars. This allows for comparison of codon-context and first codon conservation in the alignments. The graphs are organized according to the fungal phylogenetic tree described by Fitzpatrick and colleagues [39]. One fungal species was chosen for each branch of the tree, as follows: Zygomycota/Basidiomycota – C. neoformans; Schizosaccharomyces – S. pombe; Eurotiomycetes – A. fumigatus; Sordariomycetes/Leotiomycetes – N. crassa; Candida – C. tropicalis; Saccharomyces – S. mikatae; Kluyveromyces – E. gossypii. B) The same approach was used to compare codon-context and first codon conservation in a group of bacteria, archaea and high eukaryotes (see Figure S1), using E. coli, M. jannaschii and H. sapiens as reference organisms, respectively. In order to determine the statistical significance of the data the plots were tested using two-tailed T-student tests for paired samples, and all organisms showed significantly higher conservation of codon contexts than first codon conservation (10−35−7)."

(A) Distinctiveness of forest and savanna elephant species and the pattern of hybridization between forest and savanna elephants was demonstrated using the program STRUCTURE, which applies a model-based clustering algorithm to identify subgroups that have distinctive allele frequencies [30]. The two partitions correspond to African forest elephant ancestry (green) and African savanna elephant ancestry (orange), and each is confined almost exclusively (≥99.4%) to locales in, respectively, tropical forest and non-tropical forest habitats (Figure 1). Garamba (GR) is the only population that spans an intermediate habitat zone containing both forest and savanna vegetation, and both types of elephants [3], [28]. (B) A factorial correspondence analysis (FCA) implemented using the software GENETIX [35] reveals the distinctiveness of forest and savanna elephants, with a very limited degree of hybridization. A total of 555 African elephant individuals (75 forest, 19 Garamba, and 461 savanna elephants) were used in the analysis. The two major axes determined by the FCA were used; plotted on the x- and y-axes, respectively accounting for 6.68% and 2.26% of the total variability. Savanna elephants formed a group distinct from the group formed by forest plus Garamba elephants. With only one exception (GR0020), hybrid elephants do not occupy the middle space between forest and savanna elephants; rather, they tend to show only a low level of admixture [4].

"pone.0009457.g001.png","Plausible models of evolution for the inhibin/activin gene family.A) Simplified species tree for animals based upon recent large-scale analyses [93], [94], [95]. “WGD” indicates the position of the whole genome duplications [29] uniting vertebrates and letters indicate alternative models for the origin of the α-subunit (the letters used correspond to the parts of this figure). B) Cladogram showing the expected inhibin/activin phylogeny given the “early vertebrate duplication” model. Two rounds of WGD have been suggested to characterize vertebrates [28], [29], [30] and we show the only topology consistent both with two rounds of WGD and a clade containing INHBA-INHBB (the latter clade is strongly-supported in this study and in other studies; [27], [96]. C) Cladogram showing the expected phylogeny of inhibin/activin genes given the “deuterostome duplication” model, which places the α-subunit origin before the early vertebrate WGDs. Several versions of this model are possible (i.e., the α-subunit origin could predate the divergence of vertebrates from urochordates, cephalochordates, or even echinoderms). D) Cladogram showing the expected inhibin/activin phylogeny given the “early animal duplication” model, which places the α-subunit origin before the divergence of deuterosomes and protostomes. The “Dawdle orthologue” hypothesis is a version of this model. Additional duplications may have occurred in any of these models. Biased estimation of the gene tree or sampling variance may cause estimates of the gene tree to deviate from any of these idealized model trees."

"pone.0017293.g001.png","Genome analysis. We apply our method to analyze 59 influenza viruses based on their whole genomes. The natural vector and the hierarchical clustering methods are used to reconstruct the phylogenetic tree for nucleotide sequences of the whole genome sequences of selected influenza viruses. The selected viruses are chosen to be representative from among all available relevant sequences in GenBank. Sequences have both high and low divergence to avoid biasing the distribution of branch lengths. Strains are representative of the major gene lineages from different hosts. The robustness of individual nodes of the tree is assessed using a bootstrap resampling analysis with 1000 replicates shown in Supporting Information S1. From this figure, we can clearly see that new influenza A (H1N1) viruses originate from North American triple-reassortant swine virus and Eurasian classical swine virus lineage. We note that (A/swine/Nakhon pathom/NIAH586-1/2005(H3N2)), (A/duck/Nanchang/4-165/2000(H4N6)) and American avian (A/blue-winged teal/Ohio/1864/2006(H3N8)) are not clustered with A (H1N1) genomes from the same geographical regions respectively. This result is caused by the different structures of these genomes and the traditional A (H1N1) subtypes. In addition, we check the distance matrix of these genomes obtained by natural vectors and the result shows that (A/duck/Nanchang/4-165/2000(H4N6)) is the closest to A/duck/NY/185502/2002(H5N2). Meanwhile, A/blue-winged teal/Ohio/1864/2006(H3N8) is the closest to A/chicken/Korea/ES/03(H5N1) and A/egret/Hong Kong/757.2/2003(H5N1) respectively, which means that A/blue-winged teal/Ohio/1864/2006(H3N8) is evolutionary related with H5N1 avian virus outbreak in Asian countries from 2003 to 2006. As for A/swine/Nakhon pathom/NIAH586-1/2005(H3N2), it is the closest to A/swine/Tianjin/01/2004(H1N1) and then to A/swine/Ontario/55383/04(H1N2) with and A/swine/OH/511445/2007(H1N1).

The branch lengthes shown in this figure is based on the maximum likelihood result. The numbers above a branch and proceeded by a ‘+’ sign indicate the number of homologous gene clusters that are uniquely present in all daughter lineages; the numbers below a branch and proceeded by a ‘−’ sign indicate the number of homologous gene clusters that are uniquely absent. For example, 52 gene clusters are shared by all four ‘Candidatus Phytoplasma’ genomes and do not contain homolog from any of the other eight genomes analyzed (i.e., represent possible gene gain events in the common ancestor of ‘Ca.

An insertion at a leaf requires gaps at all other leaves - an understandably costly alignment move when gaps are added without regard to the phylogeny, resulting in multiple penalization for each insertion. Such a penalization would cause most non-phylogenetic aligners to prefer the “Inferred alignment” in case C where there are fewer total gaps. Aligners treating indels as phylogenetic events would penalize each of the implied multiple deletions and only penalize each insertion once, thus preferring the “True alignment” in case C."

Note that Pga-SERA1 (ga1) is an offshoot of Groups II and III SERA genes, suggesting the occurrence of a common ancestor, leading to Pga-SERA1 (ga1) and a common ancestor of Group II and Group III. In P. vivax and P. vivax-related monkey malaria parasite species, the six clades are color-boxed. Pgo-SERA1 (go1) and Pgo-SERA5 (go5) were grouped, despite low bootstrap values, into Clade 2 and Clade 5 respectively, because these genes showed common features to each clade in exon/intron structure and/or gene array."

Despite considerable differences regarding the nature of the instructive sex-determining signal (X-counting in Drosophila, male [M] dominant determiners in Musca and Ceratitis, haplo-maternal [mat] versus diplo-maternal-paternal [pat+mat] in Nasonia) many insects use tra as the binary on/off switch downstream of the signal [54], though the molecular basis of this switch in A. gambiae remains still elusive [24], [55], [56]. The dsx gene, expressing sex-specific variants DSXF and DSXM, appears to be a conserved target of the binary switch and its use as a bifunctional executor of the instructive signal was validated by gene function studies in the depicted insect species [26], [30], [56], [57], [58] Also, homologs of fru were identified in these species that express sex-specific variants FRUF and FRUM[24], [26], [27], [59]. For Musca we here present evidence that fru is a downstream target of the tra branch which is involved in controlling proper display of courtship. Though no functional fru data from other holometabolous insects are available as yet, we propose that fru independently from dsx represents another conserved effector of the instructive signal. Hence, bifurcation of the pathway downstream of tra may have already existed before the divergence of holometabolous insect orders."

Green shading represents proliferative period for endoskeletal progenitor cells. Middle rows show Hoxd13 expression domains (blue) at early and late stages of fin and limb bud outgrowth.

Endoskeletal bones are shaded as follows: green, propterygium; red, mesopterygium, yellow, metapterygium. Dermal fin rays are shown as unshaded elements within fin blade. The model suggests that a second phase of distal Hoxd13 expression was present in the paired fins of the common ancestor of chondrichthyans and osteichthyans (at position 1), and that loss of the distal Hoxd13 domain in teleosts (position 2) and its spatial expansion in tetrapods (position 3) may have been associated with temporal modulation of endoskeletal progenitor cell proliferation. Early conversion of the AER to an AEF would be expected to truncate or eliminate phase II expression of Hoxd13 and reduce the fin endoskeleton, as seen in zebrafish, whereas prolonged signaling by the AER would be expected to extend Phase II and expand the Hoxd13 domain, giving rise to digits in the tetrapod lineage.
